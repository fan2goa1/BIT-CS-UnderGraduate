Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 
By 

J. K. Rowling 
Oh, the torment bred in the race, 
the grinding scream of death


 

and the stroke that hits the vein, 
the haemorrhage none can staunch, the grief, 
the curse no man can bear. 


But there is a cure in the house 
and not outside it, no, 
not from others but from them, 

their bloody strife. We sing to you, 
dark gods beneath the earth. 
Now hear, you blissful powers underground - 

answer the call, send help. 
Bless the children, give them Triumph now. 

Aeschylus, The Libation Bearers 


Death is but crossing the world, as friends do the seas; they live in one another still. 
For they must needs be present, that love and live in that which is omnipresent. 
In this divine glass they see face to face; and their converse is free, as well as pure. 
This is the comfort of friends, that though they may be said to die, yet their friendship and 


society are, in the best sense, ever present, because immortal. 

William Penn, from More Fruits of Solitude

Chapter One 

The Dark Lord Ascending 

The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the 
narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands 
directed at each other's chests; then, recognizing each other, they 
stowed (put away, store) their wands beneath their cloaks and 
started walking briskly in the same direction. 

"News?" asked the taller of the two. 

"The best," replied Severus Snape. 

The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles (thorny bush), on the right by 
a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they 
marched. 

"Thought I might be late," said Yaxley, his blunt features (��ƽ������ /��� vs. sharp features 
[������ brutish�����ݣ��� chapter 12, p283]) sliding in and out of sight as the branches of 
overhanging trees broke the moonlight. "It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will 
be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?" 

Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the 
lane. The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of imposing 
wrought-iron gates barring the men's way. Neither of them broke step. In silence both raised their 
left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal was smoke. 

The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men's footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to 
their right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his companion's head, but the source of 
the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top 
of the hedge. 

��He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks ...�� Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak 
with a snort. 

A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights 
glinting in the diamond [���� ] paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond 
the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped

��3ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it. 

The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet 
covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the wall followed Snape 
and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next 
room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle. 

The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room��s usual 
furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire 
beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece��¯̨ surmounted (be on top of) by a gilded mirror. 
Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the 
lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently 
unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended 
by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table 
below. None of the people seated underneath this singular sight were looking at it except for a pale 
young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing 
upward every minute or so. 

 ��Yaxley. Snape,�� said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. ��You are very nearly late.�� 

The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the 
new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette���� . As they drew nearer, however, his face 
shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose 
pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow. 

��Severus, here,�� said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. ��Yaxley �C beside 
Dolohov.��

 The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it 
was to him that Voldemort spoke first. 

 ��So?�� 

��My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of 
safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.�� 

The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at 
Snape and Voldemort. 

��Saturday ... at nightfall,�� repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon Snape��s black ones

��4ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves 
would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into 
Voldemort��s face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort��s lipless mouth curved into something 
like a smile.

 ��Good. Very good. And this information comes �C��

 ���C from the source we discussed,�� said Snape. 

 ��My Lord.�� 

Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces 
turned to him.

 ��My Lord, I have heard differently.�� 

Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, ��Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that 

Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.��

 Snape was smiling. 

��My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a 

Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be 

susceptible.��

 ��I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,�� said Yaxley. 

��If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,�� said Snape. ��I assure you, Yaxley, the 
Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we 
have infiltrated the Ministry.�� 

��The Order��s got one thing right, then, eh?�� said a squat man sitting a short distance from 
Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there����;���� along the table. 

Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly 
overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought. 

��My Lord,�� Yaxley went on, ��Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to 
transfer the boy �C�� 

Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as 
Voldemort turned back to Snape.

 ��Where are they going to hide the boy next?�� 

��At the home of one of the Order,�� said Snape. ��The place, according to the source, has been

��5ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little 
chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before 
next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the 
enchantments to break through the rest.�� 

��Well, Yaxley?�� Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely in his red 

eyes. ��Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?��

 Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders. 

��My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have �C with difficulty, and after great effort �C 
succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.�� 

Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a 
long, twisted face, clapped him on the back. 

��It is a start,�� said Voldemort. ��But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be 
surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister��s life will set me back a 
long way.�� 

��Yes �C my Lord, that is true �C but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the 
Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-
ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to 
bring Scrimgeour down.�� 

��As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest,�� said 
Voldemort. ��At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If 
we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.�� 

��We are at an advantage there, my Lord,�� said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some 
portion of approval. ��We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical 
Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.�� 

��He will not do either,�� said Snape. ��The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is 

controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.��

 ��All the better,�� said Voldemort. ��He will have to move in the open. Easier to take, by far.�� 

Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, ��I shall attend to the 

boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them

��6ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.�� 

The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her 
expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter��s continued existence. Voldemort, 
however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the 
unconscious body above him. 

��I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but
���� the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things that I did not 
understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.��

 At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry 
of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had 
seemed to issue from below their feet. 

��Wormtail,�� said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and without 
removing his eyes from the revolving body above, ��have I not spoken to you about keeping our 
prisoner quiet?�� 

��Yes, m-my Lord,�� gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in 
his chair that it appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and 
scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver. 

��As I was saying,�� continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his followers, ��I 
understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to 
kill Potter.�� 

The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that he wanted to 
borrow one of their arms. 

��No volunteers?�� said Voldemort. ��Let��s see ... Lucius, I see no reason for you to have a wand 
anymore.�� 

Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, and his eyes 
were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse.

 ��My Lord?��

 ��Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.��

 ��I ...�� 

Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead, quite as pale as he was,

��7ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly 
on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed it 
along to Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely.

 ��What is it?��

 ��Elm, my Lord,�� whispered Malfoy.

 ��And the core?��

 ��Dragon �C dragon heartstring.�� 

��Good,�� said Voldemort. He drew out his wand and compared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made 
an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort��s 
wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened 
maliciously.

 ��Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?��

 Some of the throng sniggered. 

��I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you 
and your family seem less than happy of late ... What is it about my presence in your home that 

displeases you, Lucius?��

 ��Nothing �C nothing, my Lord!��

 ��Such lies, Lucius ... �� 

The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. One or two of 
the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard 
sliding across the floor beneath the table. 

The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort��s chair. It rose, seemingly endlessly, 
and came to rest across Voldemort��s shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man��s thigh; its eyes, 
with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long 
thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy. 

��Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot (fate, destiny)? Is my return, my rise to 
power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?�� 

��Of course, my Lord,�� said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper 
lip. ��We did desire it �C we do.�� 

To Malfoy��s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from Voldemort and the

��8ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced 
quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact. 

��My Lord,�� said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with emotion, ��it 
is an honor to have you here, in our family��s house. There can be no higher pleasure.�� 

She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as 
she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward 
Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness. 

��No higher pleasure,�� repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one side as he considered 

Bellatrix. ��That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.��

 Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight.

 ��My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!�� 

��No higher pleasure ... even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has taken place in your 

family this week?��

 She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused. 

 ��I don��t know what you mean, my Lord.�� 

��I��m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. She has just married 

the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.�� 

There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned forward to 
exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. The giant snake, disliking the 
disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so 
jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys�� humiliation. Bellatrix��s face, so recently flushed 
wit happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red. 

��She is no niece of ours, my Lord,�� she cried over the outpouring of mirth. ��We �C Narcissa and 
I �C have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do 
with either of us, nor any beast she marries.�� 

��What say you, Draco?�� asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly 
through the catcalls and jeers. ��Will you babysit the cubs?�� 

The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was staring down into 
his own lap, then caught his mother��s eye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed 
her own deadpan (expressionless) stare at the opposite wall.

��9ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Enough,�� said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. ��Enough.��

 And the laughter died at once. 

��Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,�� he said as Bellatrix gazed 
at him, breathless and imploring, ��You must prune�޼�֦ yours, must you not, to keep it 
healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.�� 

��Yes, my Lord,�� whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again. ��At the 
first chance!�� 

��You shall have it,�� said Voldemort. ��And in your family, so in the world ... we shall cut away 
the canker����;����that infects us until only those of the true blood remain ...�� 

Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy��s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure 
suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to life with a groan and began to 
struggle against invisible bonds. 

 ��Do you recognize our guest, Severus?�� asked Voldemort. 

Snape raised his eyes to the upside down face. All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the 
captive now, as though they had been given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face 
the firelight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice, ��Severus! Help me!��

 ��Ah, yes,�� said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again. 

��And you, Draco?�� asked Voldemort, stroking the snake��s snout with his wand-free hand. 
Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he seemed unable to look at her 
anymore. 

��But you would not have taken her classes,�� said Voldemort. ��For those of you who do not 
know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.�� 

There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched woman with 
pointed teeth cackled. 

��Yes ... Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles ... how 
they are not so different from us ... ��

 One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape again.

 ��Severus ... please ... please ... �� 

��Silence,�� said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy��s wand, and Charity fell silent as if

��10ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

gagged. ��Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week 
Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she 
says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, 
says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance ... She would have us all mate with 
Muggles ... or, no doubt, werewolves ... �� 

Nobody laughed this time. There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemort��s 
voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her 
eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from him 
again.

 ��Avada Kedavra�� 

The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a resounding 
crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in 
their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor. 

��Dinner, Nagini,�� said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered from his 
shoulders onto the polished wood.

Chapter Two 
In Memorandum 

Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand 
swearing under his breath, he shouldered open 
door. There was a crunch of breaking china. He 
on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the 
his bedroom door. 
in his left and 
his bedroom 
had trodden 
floor outside 
"What the -?" 

He looked around, the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of 
tea was Dudley's idea of a clever booby trap���� . Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry 
scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already 
crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run 
his finger under the tap. 

It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to 
perform magic... but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have 
defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came to think of it �C 
particularly in light of his immediate plans �C this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. 
Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop 
up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind 
him. 

Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he 
had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed 
off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced��...�Ż� or updated them, leaving a 
layer of general debris at the bottom �C old quills, desiccated (dry up,) beetle eyes, single socks that 
no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch������ , experienced 
a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood. 

He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped

��12ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT 
CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold 
locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge 
that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment of the 
enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt 
cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather's last gift 
except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering gritɰ��. 

Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his 
own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning's 
Daily prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter 
memories -the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by 
attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk. 

It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items, and sort the 
remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. His school and 
Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to 
be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of 
night, probably, as if they were evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility 
Cloak, potion-making kit������ , certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, 
a stack of letters, and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the 
Marauder's Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this 
place of honor not because it was valuable �C in all usual senses it was worthless �C but because of 
what it had cost to attain it. 

This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig, one 
for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer. 

He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no movement as 
he began to flick through newspapers, throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one. The owl 
was asleep or else faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was 
allowed out of her cage at the moment.

��13ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching for one 
particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the 
summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of 
Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, 
he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for. 

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED 

By Elphias Doge 

I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual 
attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. I had 
contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was no longer 
contagious, my pock-marked���� visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to 
approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted 
notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage 
and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles. 

Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had 
committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured 
me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the 
sad business, though many attempted to make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to��inclined to, willing to�� praise his father's action and assumed that Albus too was a 
Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mistaken. As anybody who knew Albus 
would attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, his determined 
support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years. 

In a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. 
By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, 
but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of 
us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example, not to mention his 
help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me later in 
life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.

��14ҳ��

He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular 
correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, 
the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the 
magical theoretician���ۼ� . Several of his papers found their way into learned 
publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical 
Potioneer. Dumbledore's future career seemed likely to be meteoric��fast and brilliant��, 
and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister of Magic. 
Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job, 
however, he never had Ministerial ambitions. 

Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus's brother, Aberforth, arrived at 
school. They were not alike: Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to 
settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite 
wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along as 
comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be 
admitted that living in Albus's shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable 
experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and 
cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother. 

When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then-traditional tour of the 
world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate 
careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, 
died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my 
departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra's funeral, then left for what was now 
to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to 
them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me. 

That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, 
perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in 
Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his day-
to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in 
my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward the end of my year's travels,

��15ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

that another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana. 

Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so soon after 
the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of her brothers. All those closest to 
Albus �C and I count myself one of that lucky number �C agree that Ariana's death, and 
Albus's feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left 
their mark upon him forevermore. 

I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person's 
suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less light-hearted. To add to his 
misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and 
Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would lift �C in later years they 
reestablished, if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial (friendly) one.) However, 
he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to 
mention them. 

Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore's 
innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery of 
the twelve uses of dragon's blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he 
displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They 
say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald 
in 1945. Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they 
watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle. Dumbledore's triumph and its 
consequences for the Wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to 
match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He Who 
Must Not Be Named. 

Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, 
however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed 
him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but 
my loss is nothing compared to the Wizarding World's. That he was the most inspiring and 
best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived, working 
always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small

boy with dragon pox as he was on the day I met him. 

Harry finished reading, but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. 
Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon 
spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled 
with a sense of humiliation. 

He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this obituary he had 
been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined 
Dumbledore's childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known 
him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like 
trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. 

He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have felt strange, 
impertinent even, but after all it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in 
that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had 
been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, 
Harry's past, Harry's future, Harry's plans... and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his 
future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he 
had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had 
ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered 
honestly, 

"What do you see when you look in the mirror?" 

"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks." 

After several minutes' thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, 
and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and its Use against the Dark 
Arts. Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It 
was much tidier. The only things left out of place were today's Daily Prophet, still lying on the 
bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror. 

Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today's Prophet, and unfolded the 
newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the

��17ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about 
Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on (depend on) the Prophet to suppress 
news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed. 

Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of 
Dumbledore striding along, looking harried, 

DUMBLEDORE �C THE TRUTH AT LAST? 

Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the 
greatest wizard of his generation. Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-
bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong 
feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave, WHY was the man 
tipped to be the Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the 
real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? HOW did 
Dumbledore really meet his end? 

The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, 
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Berry 
Braithwaite, page 13, inside. 

Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with a picture 
showing another familiar face, a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde 
hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at 
him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on. 

In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious quill-
portraits might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home, she leads me 
straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, 
a steaming vat of freshest gossip. 

"Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer's dream," says Skeeter. "Such a long, full 
life. I'm sure my book will be the first of very, very many." 

Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine-hundred-page book was completed in 
a mere four weeks after Dumbledore's mysterious death in June. I ask her how she

��18ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

managed this superfast feat. 

"Oh, when you've been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is second 

nature. I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be 

the first to meet that need." 

I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the 

Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore's, that "Skeeter's book contains 

less fact than a Chocolate Frog card." 

Skeeter throws back her head and laughs. 

"Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights, 

bless him. Completely gaga (fool, senile person), seemed to think we were sitting at the 

bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout." 

And yet Elphias Doge's accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. 

Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of 

Dumbledore's long and extraordinary life? 

"Oh, my dear," beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles (rap across 
the knuckles �C���� ), "you know as well as I do how much information can be generated 
by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word 'no,' and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes 
Quill! People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought 
he was so wonderful, you know �C he trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old Dodgy 
Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I've had access to a source most journalists 
would swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in public before and who was close 
to Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth." 

The advance publicity for Skeeter's biography has certainly suggested that there will be 

shocks in store for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a blameless life. What were 

the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask? 

"Now, come off it. Betty, I'm not giving away all the highlights before anybody's bought 

the book!" laughs Skeeter. "But I can promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore 

was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! Let's just say that nobody hearing him

rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that he dabbled���� ;ǳ�� in the Dark 
Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for 
tolerance, he wasn't exactly broad-minded when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore 
had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so 
hard to keep hushed up." 

I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, whose conviction 
by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago. 

"Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,�� laughs Skeeter. "No, no, I'm talking 
about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats, worse even 
than the Muggle-maiming father �C Dumbledore couldn't keep either of them quiet anyway, 
they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it's the mother and the sister that intrigued 
me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness �C but, as I say, you'll have to 
wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it's no wonder 
Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken." 

Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to 
Dumbledore's many magical discoveries? 

"He had brains," she concedes, "although many now question whether he could really 
take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor 
Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon's blood when 
Dumbledore 'borrowed' his papers." 

But the importance of some of Dumbledore's achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. 
What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald? 

"Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald," says Skeeter with such a tantalizing 
smile. "I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's spectacular victory must 
brace themselves for a bombshell �C or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. 
All I'll say is, don't be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend. After 
they've read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured 
a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!"

��20ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject, so we turn instead to 
the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other. 

"Oh yes," says Skeeter, nodding briskly, "I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter-
Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will 
have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an 
unnatural interest in Potter from the word go��һ��ʼ . Whether that was really in the 
boy's best interests �C well, we'll see. It's certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most 
troubled adolescence." 

I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so famously 
interviewed last year, a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively of his 
conviction that You-Know-Who had returned. 

"Oh, yes, we've developed a closer bond," says Skeeter. "Poor Potter has few real 
friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life �C the Triwizard 
Tournament. I am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the 
real Harry Potter." 

Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Dumbledore's final 
hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died? 

"Well, I don't want to say too much �C it's all in the book �C but eyewitnesses inside 
Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, 
jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against 
whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it seems? That is for the Wizarding 
community to decide �C once they've read my book." 

On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an 

instant bestseller. Dumbledore's legion of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is 

soon to emerge about their hero. 

Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. Revulsion 

and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the 

wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin. 

��21ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only 
to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from 
Rita's article echoed in his head, An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship ... 
It's been called unhealthy, even sinister ... He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth ... I've 
had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for... 

"Lies!" Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door neighbor, who had 
paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously. 

Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; he picked it 
up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita 
Skeeter was defaming him. 

A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror 
again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a 
sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia's choosing. There was nothing blue there for the mirror to 
reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye 
looking back at him. 

He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had been thinking 
of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus 
Dumbledore would never pierce him again.

Chapter Three 

The Dursleys Departing 

The sound of the front door slamming echoed 


up the stairs 
and a voice roared, ��Oi! You!�� 
Sixteen years of being addressed thus left 

Harry in no 
doubt whom his uncle was calling, nevertheless, 

he did not 
immediately respond. He was still gazing at the 

mirror 
fragment in which, for a split second, he had 

thought he 

saw Dumbledore��s eye. It was not until his uncle bellowed, "BOY!" that Harry got slowly to his 
feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack 
filled with things he would be taking with him. 

��You took you time!�� roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the top of the stairs, ��Get 
down here. I want a word!�� 

Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans' pockets. When he reached the living room 
he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for traveling; Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up 
jacket, Aunt Petunia in a neat salmon-colored coat and Dudley, Harry��s large, blond, muscular 
cousin, in his leather jacket.

 ��Yes?�� asked Harry. 

��Sit down!�� said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. ��Please!�� added Uncle Vernon, 
wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat. 

Harry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt 
Petunia and Dudley, following his movement with anxious expressions. Finally, his large purple 
face crumpled with concentration. Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke. 

"I've changed my mind,�� he said. 

"What a surprise," said Harry. 

"Don't you take that tone��" began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but Vernon Dursley waved 
her down. 

"It's all a lot of claptrap (nonsense),�� said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy little eyes. 
"I've decided I don't believe a word of it. We��re staying put, we��re not going anywhere.��

��23ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. Vernon Dursley 
had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four weeks, packing and 
unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry��s favorite moment had been the 
one when Uncle Vernon, unaware the Dudley had added his dumbbells���� to his case since the 
last time it been repacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot (British) luggage 
compartment of a car) and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing. 

��According to you,�� Vernon Dursley said, now resuming his pacing up and down the living 

room, ��we �C Petunia, Dudley and I �C are in danger. From �C from �C�� 

��Some of 'my lot' right?�� said Harry 

��Well, I don��t believe it,�� repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of Harry again. "I 

was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it's a plot to get the house." 

"The house?" repeated Harry. "What house?" 

"This house!" shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein his forehead starting to pulse. "Our house! 
House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and then you're going to 
do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and �C" 

��Are you out of your mind?" demanded Harry. "A plot to get this house? Are you actually as 
stupid as you look?" 

"Don't you dare -!" squealed Aunt Petunia, but again Vernon waved her down. Slights on his 
personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the danger he had spotted. 

"Just in case you've forgotten," said Harry, "I've already got a house, my godfather left me one. 
So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?" 

There was silence. 

Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument. 

"You claim," said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, "that this Lord Thing �C" 

"-Voldemort," said Harry impatiently, "and we've been through this about a hundred times 
already. This isn't a claim, it's fact. Dumbledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley 
�C" 

Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his uncle was attempting 
to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry's summer holidays, of 
two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley

��24ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

had come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr. 
Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been 
expected to delight Uncle Vernon. 

"-Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well," Harry pressed on remorselessly, "Once 
I'm seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as 
me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I 
am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I'd come and try to rescue you." 

Uncle Vernon's and Harry's eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant they were both 
wondering the same thing. 

Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, "You've got to go into hiding and the Order 
wants to help. You're being offered serious protection, the best there is." 

Uncle Vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down. Outside the sun hung low over 
the privet hedges. The next door neighbor's lawn mower stalledϨ�� again. 

"I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?" asked Vernon Dursley abruptly. 

"There is," said Harry, surprised. 

"Well, then, why can't they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing 
more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government protection!" 

Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in 
the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted. 

"You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said," Harry replied. "We think the Ministry has 
been infiltrated." 

Uncle Vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black 
mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration. 

"All right," he said. Stopping in front of Harry get again. "All right, let's say for the sake of 
argument we accept this protection. I still don't see why we can't have that Kingsley bloke." 

Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had also been addressed 
half a dozen times. 

"As I've told you," he said through gritted teeth, "Kingsley is protecting the Mug �C I mean, your 
Prime Minister." 

"Exactly �C he's the best!" said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank television screen. The

��25ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime 
Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of 
dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had 
caused the Dursleys to take to (like) Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any 
other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with earring in. 

"Well, he's taken,�� said Harry. "But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are more than up to the 
job �C" 

"If we'd even seen CVs (Curriculum Vitae -���˼��� ) ...�� began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost 
patience. 

Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the TV set himself. 

"These accidents aren't accidents �C the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever 
else has happened since we last watched the news. People are disappearing and dying and he's 
behind it �C Voldemort. I've told you this over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the 
fogs �C they're caused by dementors, and if you can't remember what they are, ask your son!" 

Dudley's hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents' and Harry's eyes upon him, 
he slowly lowered them again and asked, "There are... more of them?" 

"More?" laughed Harry. "More than the two that attacked us, you mean? Of course there are, 
there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed��send�� off fear and 
despair -" 

"All right, all right," blustered Vernon Dursley. "You've made your point �C" 

"I hope so," said Harry, "because once I'm seventeen, all of them �C Death Eaters, dementors, 
maybe even Inferi �C which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard �C will be able to find 
you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I 
think you'll agree you need help." 

There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing down a wooden front 
door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle 
Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, "But what about my 
work? What about Dudley's school? I don't suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout 
(idler, bum) wizards �C" 

"Don't you understand?" shouted Harry. "They will torture and kill you like they did my

parents!" 

"Dad," said Dudley in a loud voice, "Dad �C I'm going with these Order people." 

"Dudley," said Harry, "for the first time in your life, you're talking sense." 

He knew the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough to accept the Order's help, his 
parents would accompany him. There could be no question of being separated from their 
Duddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece. 

"They'll be here in about five minutes,�� he said, and when none of the Dursleys replied, he left 
the room. The prospect of parting �C probably forever �C from his aunt, uncle and cousin was one 
that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness 
in the air. What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years' solid dislike? 

Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a couple of owl nuts 

through the bars of Hedwig's cage. They fell with dull thuds to the bottom where she ignored them. 

"We're leaving soon, really soon," Harry told her. "And then you'll be able to fly again." 

The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and downstairs. It was too 
much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on their own. 

"Harry Potter!" squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened the door; a small man 
in a mauve [m.uv]����ɫ�� top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow. "An honor as ever!" 

"Thanks, Dedalus," said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark haired 
Hestia. "It's really good of you to do this... They're through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin...�� 

"Good day to you, Harry Potter's relatives!" said Dedalus happily striding into the living room. 
The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change of 
mind. Dudley shrank neared to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard. 

"I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told you, is a simple one," 
said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. "We shall be 
leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic in your house �C Harry being still 
underage it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him �C we shall be driving, say, ten 
miles or so before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you. You know how to 
drive, I take it?" He asked Uncle Vernon politely. 

"Know how to �C? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!" spluttered�����ܻ���˵ Uncle 
Vernon. 

��27ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Very clever of you, sir, very clever. I personally would be utterly bamboozled (confuse, 
bewilder) by all those buttons and knobs," said Dedalus. He was clearly under the impression that 
he was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word 
Dedalus spoke. 

"Can't even drive," he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling indignantly, but 
fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him. 

"You, Harry," Dedalus continued, "will wait here for your guard. There has been a little change 
in the arrangements �C" 

��What d'you mean?" said Harry at once. "I thought Mad-Eye was going to come and take me by 
Side Along-Apparition?" 

"Can't do it," said Hestia tersely, "Mad-Eye will explain." 

The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces, 
jumped as a loud voice screeched, "Hurry up!" Harry looked all around the room before realizing 
the voice had issued from Dedalus's pocket watch. 

"Quite right, we��re operating to a very tight schedule," said Dedalus nodding at his watch and 
tucking it back into his waist coat. "We are attempting to time your departure from the house with 
your family's Disapparition, Harry, thus the charm breaks the moment you all head for safety." He 
turned to the Dursleys, "Well, are we all packed and ready to go?" 

None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge in Dedalus's 
waistcoat pocket. 

"Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus," murmured Hestia. She clearly felt that it 
would be tactless for them to remain the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, 
possibly tearful farewells. 

"There's no need," Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary 

by saying loudly, 

"Well, this is good-bye then, boy." 

He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry's hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to 
face it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome��
����. 

"Ready, Duddy?" asked Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid

��28ҳ��

looking at Harry altogether. 

Dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding Harry a little of 
the giant, Grawp. 

"Come along, then," said Uncle Vernon. 

He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, "I don't understand." 

"What don't you understand, popkin?" asked Petunia looking up at her son. 

Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry. 

"Why isn't he coming with us? 

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze when they stood staring at Dudley as though he had just 

expressed a desire to become a ballerina. 

"What?" said Uncle Vernon loudly. 

"Why isn't he coming too?" asked Dudley. 

"Well, he -doesn't want to," said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and adding, "You 
don't want to, do you?" 

"Not in the slightest," said Harry. 

"There you are�ⲻ����," Uncle Vernon told Dudley. "Now come on we're off." 

He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley did not move and after 
a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too. 

"What now?" barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway. 

It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. After several 
moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said, "But where's he going to go?" 

Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that Dudley was frightening 
them. 

Hestia Jones broke the silence. "But... surely you know where your nephew is going?" she asked 
looking bewildered. 

"Certainly we know," said Vernon Dursley. "He's off with some of your lot, isn't he? Right, 
Dudley, let's get in the car, you heard the man, we're in a hurry.�� 

Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not follow. 

"Off with some of our lot?" Hestia looked outraged. 

Harry had met this attitude before. Witches and wizards seemed stunned that his close living

relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter. 

"It's fine," Harry assured her. "It doesn't matter, honestly." 

"Doesn't matter?" repeated Hestia, her voice rising considerably. "Don't these people realize 

what you've been through? What danger you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of 

the anti-Voldemort movement?" 

"Er �Cno, they don't," said Harry. "They think I'm a waste of space, actually but I'm used to �C" 

"I don't think you're a waste of space (person who is stupid or useless)." 

If Harry had not seen Dudley's lips move, he might not have believed it. As it was, he stared at 

Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for 

one thing, Dudley had turned red. 

Harry was embarrassed and astonished himself. "Well... er... thanks, Dudley." 

Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy (heavy, awkward) for expression 

before mumbling, "You saved my life," 

"Not really," said Harry. "It was your soul the dementor would have taken...�� 

He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact during this summer or last, 
as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on 
(begin to understand) Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that 
morning might not have been a booby trap at all. 

Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have 
exhausted his ability to express his feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley 
subsided into scarlet-faced silence. 

Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage 
as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather than Harry. 

"S-so sweet, Dudders...�� she sobbed into his massive chest. "S-such a lovely b-boy... s-saying 
thank you...�� 

"But he hasn't said thank you at all!" said Hestia indignantly. "He only said he didn't think Harry 
was a waste of space!" 

"Yeah, but coming from Dudley that's like 'I love you,'" said Harry, torn between annoyance and 
a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from 
a burning building.

"Are we going or not?" roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living room door. "I 
thought we were on a tight schedule!" 

"Yes �C yes, we are," said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these exchanged with an air 
of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. "We really must be off. Harry -" 

He tripped������ forward and wrung Harry's hand with both of his own. 

"-good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon your 

shoulders." 

"Oh," said Harry, "right. Thanks." 

"Farwell, Harry," said Hestia also clasping his hand. "Our thoughts go with you." 

"I hope everything's okay," said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and Dudley. 

"Oh, I'm sure we shall end up the best of chums," said Diggle slightly, waving his hat as he left 
the room. Hestia followed him. 

Dudley gently released himself from his mother's clutches and walked toward Harry who had to 
repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then Dudley held out his large, pink hand. 

"Blimey, Dudley," said Harry over Aunt Petunia's renewed sobs, "did the dementors blow a 
different personality into you?" 

"Dunno," muttered Dudley, "See you, Harry." 

"Yea ...�� said Harry, taking Dudley's hand and shaking it. "Maybe. Take care, Big D." 

Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry heard his heavy footfalls on the 

graveled drive, and then a car door slammed. 

Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, looked around at the sound. She 
did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet 
handkerchief into her pocket, she said, "Well �C good-bye" and marched towards the door without 
looking at him. 

"Good-bye," said Harry. 

She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to 
say something to him. 

She gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with 
a little jerk of her head, she hustled out of the room after he husband and son.

Chapter Four 

The Seven Potters 

Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, 


arriving at the 
window just in time to see the Dursleys' car 

swinging out 
of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus��s top 

hat was 
visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the 

backseat. The 
car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its 

windows 
burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting 

sun, and then 
it was gone. 

Harry picked up Hedwig��s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy 
bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, 
where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading 
rapidly, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence 
and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time. 

Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the 
hours of solitude had been a rare treat. Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he 
had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley��s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the 
channels to his heart��s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling remembering those times; it was 
like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost. 

��Don��t you want to take a last look at the place?�� he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with 
her head under her wing. ��We��ll never be here again. Don��t you want to remember all the good 
times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories ... Dudley sobbed on it after I saved him from 
the dementors ... Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? ... And last summer, 
Dumbledore walked through that front door ...�� 

Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve 
it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door. 

��And under here, Hedwig�� �C Harry pulled open a door under the stairs �C ��is where I used to 
sleep! You never knew me then �C Blimey, it��s small, I��d forgotten ... �� 

Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake

��32ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned 
with a spider or two. 

Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had 
found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But 
Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days, confused dreams 
involving flashes of green light and once �C Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry 
had recounted it �C a flying motorbike ... 

There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk 
and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle 
Vernon��s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring 
out of the window into the back garden. 

The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, figures began to 
pop���� into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, 
wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar 
attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, 
black winged horses. 

Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a general cry of 
greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, 
��All righ��, Harry? Ready fer the off?�� 

��Definitely,�� said Harry, beaming around at them all. ��But I wasn��t expecting this many of 
you!�� 

��Change of plan,�� growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous bulging sacks, and 
whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. 
��Let��s get undercover before we talk you through it.�� 

Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, 
sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia��s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless 
appliances; Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and 
George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, 
balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye 
whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin,

��33ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald 
and broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting 
his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog��������� ;�ͼ��� , 
with his droopy beady hound��s eyes and matted hair. Harry��s heart seemed to expand and glow at 
the sight. He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle 
the last time they had met. 

��Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?�� he called across the 

room.

 ��He can get along without me for one night,�� said Kingsley, ��You��re more important.�� 

��Harry, guess what?�� said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine, and she 

wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glistened there. 

 ��You got married?�� Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin.

 ��I��m sorry you couldn��t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.��

 ��That��s brilliant, congrat �C�� 

��All right, all right, we��ll have time for a cozy catch-up later,�� roared Moody over the hubbub 

(disturbance, commotion), and silence fell in the kitchen. 

Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. ��As Dedalus probably told you, we 
had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He��s made it 
an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or 
Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in 
at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother��s charm does that already. What he��s really 
done is to stop you getting out of here safely.��

 ��Second problem, you��re underage, which means you��ve still got the Trace on you.��

 ��I don��t �C�� 

��The Trace, the Trace!�� said Mad-Eye impatiently. ��The charm that detects magical activity 
around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone 
around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will 
the Death Eaters. 

��We can��t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen you��ll lose all 
the protection your mother gave you. In short, Pius Thicknesse thinks he��s got you cornered good

��34ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and proper.��

 Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse.

 ��So what are we going to do?�� 

��We��re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can��t detect, 
because we don��t need to cast spells to use them, brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid��s motorbike.�� 

Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to 
address them. 

��Now, your mother��s charm will only break under two conditions, when you come of age, or -�� 
Moody gestured around the pristine��immaculate�� kitchen, ��-you no longer call this place 
home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding 
that you��re never going to live together again, correct?��

 Harry nodded. 

��So this time, when you leave, there��ll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment 
you get outside its range. We��re choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for 
You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen. 

��The one thing we��ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn��t know we��re moving you 
tonight. We��ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry. They think you��re not leaving until the thirtieth. 
However, this is You-Know-Who we��re dealing with, so we can��t rely on him getting the date 
wrong; he��s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in 
case. So, we��ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. They all 
look like they could be the place we��re going to hide you, they��ve all got some connection with the 
Order, my house, Kingsley��s place, Molly��s Auntie Muriel��s �C you get the idea.��

 ��Yeah,�� said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan. 

��You��ll be going to Tonks��s parents. Once you��re within the boundaries of the protective 
enchantments we��ve put on their house you��ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any 
questions?�� 

��Er �C yes,�� said Harry. ��Maybe they won��t know which of the twelve secure houses I��m 
heading for at first, but won��t it be sort of obvious once�� �C he performed a quick headcount �C 
��fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks��s parents?�� 

��Ah,�� said Moody, ��I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won��t be flying to

��35ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Tonks��s parents. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them 
with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.�� 

From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. There was no 
need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.

 ��No!�� he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. ��No way!��

 ��I told them you��d take it like this,�� said Hermione with a hint of complacency.

 ��If you think I��m going to let six people risk their lives -!��

 ��- because it��s the first time for all of us,�� said Ron. 

 ��This is different, pretending to be me �C�� 

��Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,�� said Fred earnestly. ��Imagine if something went 

wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.��

 Harry did not smile. ��You can��t do it if I don��t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.�� 

��Well, that��s the plan scuppered (British) destroy),�� said George. ��Obviously there��s no chance 
at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.�� 

��Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who��s not allowed to use magic; we��ve got no chance,�� 
said Fred.

 ��Funny,�� said Harry, ��really amusing.�� 

��If it has to come to force, then it will,�� growled Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little 
in its socket as he glared at Harry. ��Everyone here��s overage, Potter, and they��re all prepared to 
take the risk.�� 

Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of 
the side of Moody��s head. 

��Let��s have no more arguments. Time��s wearing onʱ������� . I want a few of your hairs, 
boy, now.��

 ��But this is mad, there��s no need �C�� 

��No need!�� snarled Moody. ��With You-Know-Who out there and half the Ministry on his side? 
Potter, if we��re lucky he��ll have swallowed the fake bait and he��ll be planning to ambush you on 
the thirtieth, but he��d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it��s what I��d do. 
They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother��s charm holds, but it��s about 
to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use decoysȦ�� ,��

��36ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

ƭ. Even You-Know-Who can��t split himself into seven.��

 Harry caught Hermione��s eye and looked away at once. 

 ��So, Potter �C some of your hair, if you please.��

 Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way.

 ��Now!�� barked Moody. 

With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed a hank (coil) 
of hair, and pulled. 

��Good,�� said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion. 
��Straight in here, if you please.�� 

Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with its surface, 
the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold. 

��Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,�� said Hermione, before catching 
sight of Ron��s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, ��Oh, you know what I mean �C 
Goyle��s potion tasted like bogies.��

 ��Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,�� said Moody.

 Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia��s gleaming sink. 

 ��We��re one short,�� said Lupin. 

��Here,�� said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped 
him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred 

and George instead.

 ��I��m a soldier, I��d sooner be a protector,�� said Mundungus. 

��Shut it,�� growled Moody. ��As I��ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we 
run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who 
would want to finish Potter in person. It��ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, 
the Death Eaters��ll want to kill them.�� 

Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen 
eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice 
Potion into each one. 

 ��Altogether, then ... �� 

Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped and grimaced

��37ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

as the potion hit their throats; At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. 
Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and George were shrinking; their 
hair was darkening, Hermione��s and Fleur��s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls. 

Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with 
him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of 
him.

 Fred and George turned to each other and said together, ��Wow �C we��re identical!�� 

��I dunno, though, I think I��m still better-looking,�� said Fred, examining his reflection in the 
kettle. 

��Bah,�� said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, ��Bill, don��t look at me �C I��m 
��ideous.�� 

��Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I��ve got smaller here,�� said Moody, indicating the first 
sack, ��and vice versa. Don��t forget the glasses, there��s six pairs in the side pocket. And when 
you��re dressed, there��s luggage in the other sack.�� 

The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he 
had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangersĳ�˵ĸ��� (���Ե�
��) rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things 
away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping 
off with impunity (without punishment), clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they 
would have been with their own. 

 ��I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,�� said Ron, looking down at his bare chest.

 ��Harry, your eyesight really is awful,�� said Hermione, as she put on glasses. 

Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a stuffed snowy 
owl, from the second sack. 

��Good,�� said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden Harrys faced 

him. ��The pairs will be as follows, Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom �C��

 ��Why��m I with you?�� grunted the Harry nearest the back door. 

��Because you��re the one that needs watching,�� growled Moody, and sure enough, his magical 
eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, ��Arthur and Fred �C�� 

��I��m George,�� said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. ��Can��t you even tell us apart when

��38ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

we��re Harry?��

 ��Sorry, George �C��

 ��I��m only yanking your wand, I��m Fred really �C�� 

��Enough messing around!�� snarled Moody. ��The other one �C George or Fred or whoever you 

are �C you��re with Remus. Miss Delacour �C��

 ��I��m taking Fleur on a thestral,�� said Bill. ��She��s not that fond of brooms.�� 

Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy (overly sentimental), slavish look 

that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again.

 ��Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral �C�� 

Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley��s smile; Harry knew that Hermione too 
lacked confidence on a broomstick. 

��Which leaves you and me, Ron!�� said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree�ұ��� as she 
waved at him.

 Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione. 

��An�� you��re with me, Harry. That all righ��?�� said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. ��We��ll be on 

the bike, brooms an�� thestrals can��t take me weight, see. Not a lot o�� room on the seat with me on 

it, though, so you��ll be in the sidecar.��

 ��That��s great,�� said Harry, not altogether truthfully. 

��We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,�� said Moody, who seemed to 
guess how Harry was feeling. ��Snape��s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he��s 
never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we��re betting they��ll choose one of 
the Potters who looks at home on a broomstick. All right then,�� he went on, tying up the sack with 
the fake Potters�� clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, ��I make it three minutes until 
we��re supposed to leave. No point locking the back door, it won��t keep the Death Eaters out when 
they come looking. Come on ...�� 

Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig��s cage and followed the group to the 
dark back garden. 

On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been helped up onto 
a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside 
the motorbike, goggles on. 

��39ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Is this it? Is this Sirius��s bike?�� 

��The very same,�� said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. ��An�� the last time yeh was on it, Harry, 
I could fit yeh in one hand!�� 

Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It placed him several 
feet below everybody else, Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper 
car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig��s cage 
between his knees. He was extremely uncomfortable. 

��Arthur��s done a bit o�� tinkerin��,�� said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry��s discomfort. He settled 
himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. ��It��s got a 
few tricks up its sleeves (concealed, hidden) now. Tha�� one was my idea.�� He pointed a thick 
finger at a purple button near the speedometer. 

"Please be careful, Hagrid." said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his 
broomstick. "I'm still not sure that was advisable and it's certainly only to be used in emergencies." 

"All right, then." said Moody. "Everyone ready, please. I want us all to leave at exactly the same 
time or the whole point of the diversion's lost." 

Everybody motioned their heads. 

"Hold tight now, Ron," said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a forcing, guilty look at Lupin 
before placing his hands on each side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life, it roared 
like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. 

��Good luck, everyone,�� shouted Moody. ��See you all in about an hour at the Burrow. On the 
count of three. One ... two .. THREE.��

 There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch. He was 
rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him 
brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. His legs, jammed 
into the sidecar by Hedwig��s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So 
great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four Privet Drive. 
By the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. 

And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty hooded figures, 
suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the middle of which the Order members had risen, 
oblivious �C 

��40ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Screams, a blaze of green light on every side, Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. 
Harry lost any sense of where they were. Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging 
to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his 
knees �C 

"No �C HELP!" 

The broomstick spun too, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of 
the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, and then another burst 
of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. 

"No �C NO!" 

The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid 
blasted through their circle. 

"Hedwig �C Hedwig �C" 

But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He could not take it in, 
and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of 
people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, 
but he could not tell who they were �C 

"Hagrid, we've got to go back, we've got to go back!" he yelled over the thunderous roar of the 
engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig's cage into the floor, refusing to believe that she 
was dead. "Hagrid, TURN AROUND!" 

"My job's ter get you there safe, Harry!" bellow Hagrid, and he opened the throttle����. 

"Stop �C STOP!" Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his 
left ear, Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for 
Hagrid's broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more 
curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around 
he cried, "Stupefy!" and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the 
four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to avoid it. 

"Hold on, Harry, this'll do for 'em!" roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see 
Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. 

A wall, a solid black wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it 
expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was

not so lucky; He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his 
broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne 
wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up. 

More Killing Curses flew past Harry's head from the two remaining Death Eaters' wands; they 
were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells, Red and green collided in 
midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles 
below who would have no idea what was happening �C 

"Here we go again, Harry, hold on!" yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a second button. This time 
a great net burst from the bike's exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they 
swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught 
up. He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, 
all shooting curses after it. 

"This'll do it, Harry, hold on tight!" yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his whole hand onto 
the purple button beside the speedometer. 

With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-hot and blue, 
and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death 
Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar 
sway ominously, its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration. 

"It's all righ', Harry!" bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed; 
nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike's slipstream. 

"I'm on it, Harry, don' worry!" Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his 
flowery pink umbrella. 

"Hagrid! No! Let me!" 

"REPARO!" 

There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely. Harry sped 

forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike's flight, then the sidecar began to lose height �C 

In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, "Wingardium Leviosa!" 

The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne. He had but a split second's 
relief, however, as more curses streaked past him, the three Death Eaters were closing in. 

"I'm comin', Harry!" Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar

��42ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

beginning to sink again, Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming 
figures and yelled, "Impedimenta!" 

The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest; for a moment the man was absurdly spreadeagled 
in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier, one of his fellows almost collided with 
him �C 

Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to 

Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat �C 

"I'm comin', Harry, I'm comin'!" 

A huge hand seized the back of Harry's robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; 
Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbike's seat and found 
himself back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death 
Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, 
"Confringo!" 

He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it 
was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished. 

"Harry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," moaned Hagrid, "I shouldn'ta tried ter repair it meself �C yeh've got 
no room �C" 

"It's not a problem, just keep flying!" Harry shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged 
out of the darkness, drawing closer. 

As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged, 
Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so 
insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding 
them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them, the closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his 
hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of 
Stanley Shunpike �C Stan �C 

"Expelliarmus!" Harry yelled. 

"That's him, it's him, it's the real one!" 

The hooded Death Eater's shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the motorbike's 
engine. Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view. 

"Harry, what's happened?" bellowed Hagrid. "Where've they gone?" 

��43ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I don't know!" 

But Harry was afraid. The hooded Death Eater had shouted, "It's the real one!"; how had he 
known? He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they? 

He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of Hagrid's jacket. 

"Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let's get out of here!" 

"Hold on tight, then, Harry!" 

There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust, 

Harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had. Hagrid flung backward 

upon him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars �C 

"I think we've lost 'em Harry, I think we've done it!" yelled Hagrid. 

But Harry was not convinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was 

sure would come... Why had they fallen back? One of them had still had a wand... It's him... it's the 

real one... They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan.. 

"We're nearly there, Harry, we've nearly made it!" shouted Hagrid. 

Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as 
stars. 

Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire, as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the 
bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind �C 

And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or 
thestral to hold him, his snake-like face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his 
wand again �C 

Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for 
dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly 
past him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the 
engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control �C 

Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, which down, His 
scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet 
from him, he saw it raise its arm �C 

"NO!" 

With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to his horror,

��44ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater, falling out of sight, their combined weight too much 

for the broomstick �C 

Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard Voldemort scream, "Mine!" 

It was over, He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed another Death Eater 

swooping out of the way and heard, "Avada �C" 

As the pain from Harry's scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own accord. He felt it 
drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed 
eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death Eater yelled; Voldemort 
screamed, "NO!" Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched 
it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the 
ground. 

"Hagrid!" Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. "Hagrid �C Accio Hagrid!" 

The motorbike sped up, sucked towards the earth. Face level with the handlebars, Harry could 
see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer, He was going to crash and there was 
nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, "Your wand, Selwyn, give me your 
wand!" 

He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was 
sure they would be the last thing he ever saw, Voldemort preparing to curse him once more. 

And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground 
below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with an 
earsplitting, ground trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy pond.

Chapter Five 
Fallen Warrior 



"Hagrid?" 

Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris 


of metal and 
leather that surrounded him; his hands sank into 

inches of 
muddy water as he tried to stand. He could not 

understand 
where Voldemort had gone and expected him to 

swoop out of 
the darkness at any moment. Something hot and wet 

was trickling 
down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the 

pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid. 

"Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me �C" 

But the dark mass did not stir. 

"Who's there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?" 

Harry did not recognize the man's voice. Then a woman shouted. "They've crashed. Ted! 

Crashed in the garden!" 

Harry's head was swimming. 

"Hagrid," he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled. 

The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions, with a burning 
sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead 
was still throbbing. 

"Hagrid?" 

He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room. 
His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man 
was watching Harry anxiously. 

"Hagrid's fine, son," said the man, "the wife's seeing to him now. How are you feeling? 
Anything else broken? I've fixed your ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I'm Ted, by the way, Ted 
Tonks �C Dora's father." 

Harry sat up too quickly. Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy.

��46ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Voldemort �C" 

"Easy, now," said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder and pushing him back against 
the cushions. "That was a nasty crash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong 
with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?" 

"No," said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. "Death Eaters, loads of them �C we were 
chased �C" 

"Death Eaters?" said Ted sharply. "What d'you mean, Death Eaters? I thought they didn't know 
you were being moved tonight, I thought �C" 

"They knew," said Harry. 

Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above. 

"Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don't we? They shouldn't be able to get within 

a hundred yards of the place in any direction." 

Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the point when the 
motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order's charms. He only hoped they would continue to work, 
He imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate 
what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble. 

He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes before he would 
believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid 
squeezed through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but miraculously alive. 

"Harry!" 

Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra֩�뱧����ֲ�� , he covered the floor 
between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired 
ribs. "Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o' that? I thought we were both goners." 

"Yeah, me too. I can't believe �C" 

Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid. 

"You!" he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty. 

"Your wand's here, son," said Ted, tapping it on Harry's arm. "It fell right beside you, I picked it 
up... And that's my wife you're shouting at." 

"Oh, I'm �C I'm sorry." 

As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks's resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became

��47ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

much less pronounced, Her hair was a light��s soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. 
Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry's exclamation. 

"What happened to our daughter?" she asked. "Hagrid said you were ambushed; where is 
Nymphadora?" 

"I don't know," said Harry. "We don't know what happened to anyone else." 

She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the sight of their 
expressions, if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He had consented to the 
plan, given them his hair... 

"The Portkey," he said, remembering all of a sudden. "We've got to get back to the Burrow and 
find out �C then we'll be able to send you word, or �C or Tonks will, once she's �C" 

"Dora'll be ok, Dromeda," said Ted. "She knows her stuff, she's been in plenty of tight spots 
(difficult positions) with the Aurors. The Portkey's through here," he added to Harry. "It's 
supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it." 

"Yeah, we do," said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders. "I �C" 

He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for 
which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him that he did not seem hollow and 
insincere. 

"I'll tell Tonks �C Dora �C to send word, when she ... Thanks for patching us up, thanks for 
everything, I �C" 

He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom. 
Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel. 

"There you go, son. That's the Portkey." 

Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush��ˢlying on the dressing table. 

"Thanks," said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave. 

"Wait a moment," said Hagrid, looking around. "Harry, where's Hedwig?" 

"She ... she got hit," said Harry. 

The realization crashed over him, He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes. The 
owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been 
forced to return to the Dursleys. 

Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder. 

��48ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Never mind," he said gruffly, "Never mind. She had a great old life �C" 

"Hagrid!" said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue, and Hagrid only just 
got his forefinger to it in time. 

With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward, 
Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he 
and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Second later, Harry's feet slammed onto hard ground 
and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. He heard screams. Throwing aside 
the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and 
Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, 
clambered laboriously to his feet. 

"Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?" cried Mrs. Weasley. 

"What d'you mean? Isn't anyone else back?" Harry panted. 

The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley's pale face. 

"The Death Eaters were waiting for us," Harry told her, "We were surrounded the moment we 
took off �C they knew it was tonight �C I don't know what happened to anyone else, four of them 
chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with us �C" 

He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to understand why he did not 
know what had happened to her sons, but �C 

"Thank goodness you're all right," she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved. 

"Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?" asked Hagrid a little shakily, "Fer medicinal 

purposes?" 

She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward the crooked house, Harry 
knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for 
information at once. 

"Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Portkey, it came back 
without them," she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. "And that one," she 
pointed at an ancient sneaker, "should have been Dad and Fred's, they were supposed to be second. 
You and Hagrid were third and," she checked her watch, "if they made it, George and Lupin ought 
to be back in about a minute." 

Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. He uncorked

��49ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

it and drank it straight down in one. 

"Mum!" shouted Ginny pointing to a spot several feet away. 

A blue light had appeared in the darkness. It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin and George 
appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately that there was something wrong, 
Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood. 

Harry ran forward and seized George's legs. Together, he and Lupin carried George into the 
house and through the kitchen to the living room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the 
lamplight fell across George's head, Ginny gasped and Harry's stomach lurched, one of George's 
ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood. 

No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son that Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and 
dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his 
bulk through the back door. 

"Oi!" said Hagrid indignantly, "Le' go of him! Le' go of Harry!" 

Lupin ignored him. 

"What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?" 
he said, giving Harry a small shake. "Answer me!" 

"A �C a grindylow in a tank, wasn't it?" 

Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. 

"Wha' was tha' about?" roared Hagrid. 

"I'm sorry, Harry, but I had to check," said Lupin tersely. "We've been betrayed. Voldemort 

knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were 

directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor." 

"So why aren' you checkin' me?" panted Hagrid, still struggling with the door. 

"You're half-giant," said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. "The Polyjuice Potion is designed for 

human use only." 

"None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight," said Harry. The idea 
was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. "Voldemort only caught up with me 
toward the end, he didn't know which one I was in the beginning. If he'd been in on the plan he'd 
have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid." 

"Voldemort caught up with you?" said Lupin sharply. "What happened? How did you escape?" 

��50ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry explained how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true 
Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who had 
appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks's parents. 

"They recognized you? But how? What had you done?" 

"I ...�� Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion. "I 
saw Stan Shunpike ... You know, the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried 
to Disarm him instead of �C well, he doesn't know what he's doing, does he? He must be 
Imperiused!" 

Lupin looked aghast. 

"Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least 
Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!" 

"We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd fallen, he'd 
have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two 
years ago," Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias 
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore's Army how to Disarm. 

"Yes, Harry," said Lupin with painful restraint, "and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed 
that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under the imminent threat of 
death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first 
occasion was close to suicidal!" 

"So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?" said Harry angrily. 

"Of course not," said Lupin, "but the Death Eaters �C frankly, most people! �C would have 
expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to 
think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!" 

Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him. 

"I won't blast people out of my way just because they're there," said Harry, "That's Voldemort's 
job." 

Lupin's retort was lost. 

Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; it 
collapsed beneath him. 

Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again. "Will George be okay?"

��51ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

All Lupin's frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question. 

"I think so, although there's no chance of replacing his ear, not when it's been cursed off �C" 

There was a scuffling���Ž��� from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt over 
Hagrid's legs and sprinted into the yard. 

Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized they were 
Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat 
hanger. Hermione flung herself into Harry's arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of 
any of them. Over Hermione's shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin's chest. 

"The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us!" 

"'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,'" said Lupin calmly. 

Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, "It's him, I've checked!" 

"All right, all right!" said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak, "But somebody 
betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!" 

"So it seems," replied Lupin, "but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven 

Harrys." 

"Small comfort!" snarled Kingsley. "Who else is back?" 

"Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me." 

Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. 

"What happened to you?" Lupin asked Kingsley. 

"Followed by five, injured two, might've killed one," Kingsley reeled off (say easily), "and we 

saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly. 

Remus, he can �C" 

"Fly," supplied Harry. "I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me." 

"So that's why he left, to follow you!" said Kingsley, "I couldn't understand why he'd vanished. 

But what made him change targets?" 

"Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike," said Lupin. 

"Stan?" repeated Hermione. "But I thought he was in Azkaban?" 

Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. "Hermione, there's obviously been a mass breakout which the 
Ministry has hushed up. Travers's hood fell off when I cursed him, he's supposed to be inside too. 
But what happened to you, Remus? Where's George?" 

��52ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"He lost an ear," said Lupin. 

"Lost an -?" repeated Hermione in a high voice. 

"Snape's work," said Lupin. 

"Snape?" shouted Harry. "You didn't say �C" 

"He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a specialty of Snape's. I wish I 
could say I'd paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he 
was injured, he was losing so much blood." 

Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no sign of 
movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying friends. Where was 
Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-Eye, and 
Mundungus? 

"Harry, give us a hand!" called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again. 
Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free. They headed through the empty kitchen and back 
into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs. Weasley 
had staunched (cause a wound to stop bleeding) his bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw 
a clean gaping hole where George's ear had been. 

"How is he?" 

Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, "I can't make it grow back, not when it's been removed 
by Dark Magic. But it could've been so much worse ... He's alive." 

"Yeah," said Harry. "Thank God." 

"Did I hear someone else in the yard?" Ginny asked. 

"Hermione and Kingsley," said Harry. 

"Thank goodness," Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry wanted to hug her, hold 
on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the 
impulse, there was a great crash from the kitchen. 

"I'll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I've seen my son, now back off if you know what's good for 
you!" 

Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into the living room, his 
bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but 
uninjured. 

��53ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Arthur!" sobbed Mrs. Weasley. "Oh thank goodness!" 

"How is he?" 

Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first time since Harry had known him, 
Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin's wound as if he 

could not believe what he was seeing. 

Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father's arrival, George stirred. 

"How do you feel, Georgie?" whispered Mrs. Weasley. 

George's fingers groped for the side of his head. 

"Saint-like," he murmured. 

"What's wrong with him?" croaked Fred, looking terrified. "Is his mind affected?" 

"Saint-like," repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. "You see... I'm 
holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?" 

Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred's pale face. "Pathetic," he told 
George. "Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?" 

"Ah well," said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. "You'll be able to tell us apart now, 
anyway, Mum." He looked around. "Hi, Harry �C you are Harry, right?" 

"Yeah, I am," said Harry, moving closer to the sofa. 

"Well, at least we got you back okay," said George. "Why aren't Ron and Bill huddled round my 
sickbed?" 

"They're not back yet, George," said Mrs. Weasley. George's grin faded. Harry glanced at Ginny 
and motioned to her to accompany him back outside. 

As they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice. "Ron and Tonks should be back by 
now. They didn't have a long journey; Auntie Muriel's not that far from here." 

Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but 
now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. 
As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand. 

Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky every time he turned. Harry 
was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and 
Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None of them looked around when 
Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.

The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slightest breath of wind 
made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing 
Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves �C 

And then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground �C 

"It's them!" screamed Hermione. 

Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere. 

"Remus!" Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin's arms. His face was set and 
white. He seemed unable to speak, Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione. 

"You're okay," he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly. "I thought �C I 

thought �C" 

"'M all right," said Ron, patting her on the back. "'M fine." 

"Ron was great," said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. "Wonderful. Stunned one 

of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you're aiming at a moving target from a flying 

broom �C" 

"You did?" said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck. 

"Always the tone of surprise," he said a little grumpily, breaking free. "Are we the last back?" 

"No," said Ginny, "we're still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye and Mundungus. I'm 

going to tell Mum and Dad you're okay, Ron �C" 

She ran back inside. 

"So what kept you? What happened?" Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks. 

"Bellatrix," said Tonks. "She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus. She tried very 

hard to kill me. I just wish I'd got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus ... 

Then we got to Ron's Auntie Muriel's and we missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us �C" 

A muscle was jumping in Lupin's jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else. 

"So what happened to you lot?" Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley. 

They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the continued absence of Bill, 
Fleur, Mad-Eye and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder 
to ignore. 

"I'm going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an hour ago," said 
Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. "Let me know when they're back." 

��55ҳ��

Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the 
gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow's 
boundaries. 

Mr. And Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind them. Both parents 

hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks. 

"Thank you," said Mrs. Weasley, "for our sons." 

"Don't be silly, Molly," said Tonks at once. 

"How's George?" asked Lupin. 

"What's wrong with him?" piped up Ron. 

"He's lost �C" 

But the end of Mrs. Weasley's sentence was drowned in a general outcry. A thestral had just 

soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but 

unhurt. 

"Bill! Thank God, thank God �C" 

Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. Looking 
directly at his father, he said, "Mad-Eye's dead." 

Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside him was falling, falling 
through the earth, leaving him forever. 

"We saw it," said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the 
kitchen window. "It happened just after we broke out of the circle, Mad-Eye and Dung were close 
by us, they were heading north too. Voldemort �C he can fly �C went straight for them. Dung 
panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort's curse 
hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off his broom and �C there was nothing we could do, 
nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our own tail �C" 

Bill's voice broke. 

"Of course you couldn't have done anything," said Lupin. 

They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend it. Mad-Eye dead; it 
could not be ... Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor... 

At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no point of waiting 
in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. And Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow,

and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing together. 

"What's wrong?" said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered, "What's happened? Who's -?" 

"Mad-Eye," said Mr. Weasley, "Dead." 

The twins' grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know what to do. Tonks was 
crying silently into a handkerchief, she had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and 
his prot��g��e at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the floor in the corner where 
he had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief. 

Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-whisky and some glasses. 

"Here," he said, and with a wave of his wand, he sent twelve full glasses soaring through the 
room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. "Mad-Eye." 

"Mad-Eye," they all said, and drank. 

"Mad-Eye," echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup. The firewhisky seared Harry's throat. It 

seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, firing him 

with something that was like courage. 

"So Mundungus disappeared?" said Lupin, who had drained his own glass in one. 

The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching Lupin, both wanting him to 

go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what they might hear. 

"I know what you're thinking," said Bill, "and I wondered that too, on the way back here, 
because they seemed to be expecting us, didn't they? But Mundungus can't have betrayed us. They 
didn't know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case 
you've forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery (deception, 
trickery). Why wouldn't he have told them the essential point? I think Dung panicked, it's as simple 
as that. He didn't want to come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who 
went straight for them. It was enough to make anyone panic." 

"You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to," sniffed Tonks. "Mad-Eye said 
he'd expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, 
and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley." 

"Yes, and zat eez all very good," snapped Fleur, "but still eet does not explain 'ow zey know we 
were moving 'Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must 'ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date 
to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze 'ole plan."

She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face, silently daring any of 
them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid 
hiccupping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had just risked his own 
life to save Harry's �C Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into 
giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon's egg. 

"No," Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised, The firewhisky seemed to have 
amplified his voice. "I mean ... if somebody made a mistake," Harry went on, "and let something 
slip, I know they didn't mean to do it. It's not their fault," he repeated, again a little louder than he 
would usually have spoken. "We've got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don't think anyone in 
this room would ever sell me to Voldemort." 

More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry felt a little hot again, and 
drank some more firewhisky for something to do. As he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye 
had always been scathing about Dumbledore's willingness to trust people. 

"Well said, Harry," said Fred unexpectedly. 

"Year, 'ear, 'ear," said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of whose mouth twitched. 

Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close to pitying. 

"You think I'm a fool?" demanded Harry. 

"No, I think you're like James," said Lupin, "who would have regarded it as the height of 
dishonor to mistrust his friends." 

Harry knew what Lupin was getting at, that his father had been betrayed by his friend Peter 
Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set 
down his glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, "There's work to do. I can ask Kingsley 
whether �C" 

"No," said Bill at once, "I'll do it, I'll come." 

"Where are you going?" said Tonks and Fleur together. 

"Mad-Eye's body," said Lupin. "We need to recover it." 

"Can't it -?" began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill. 

"Wait?" said Bill, "Not unless you'd rather the Death Eaters took it?" 

Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said goodbye and left. 

The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who remained standing. The

��58ҳ��

suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence. 

"I've got to go too," said Harry. 

Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him. 

"Don't be silly, Harry," said Mrs. Weasley, "What are you talking about?" 

"I can't stay here." 

He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, he had not hurt like this for more than a year. 

"You're all in danger while I'm here. I don't want �C" 

"But don't be so silly!" said Mrs. Weasley. "The whole point of tonight was to get you here 

safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur's agreed to get married here rather than in France, 

we've arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you �C" 

She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better. 

"If Voldemort finds out I'm here �C" 

"But why should he?" asked Mrs. Weasley. 

"There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry," said Mr. Weasley. "He's got no way of 

knowing which safe house you're in." 

"It's not me I'm worried for!" said Harry. 

"We know that," said Mr. Weasley quietly, "but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather 
pointless if you left." 

"Yer not goin' anywhere," growled Hagrid. "Blimey, Harry, after all we wen' through ter get you 
here?" 

"Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?" said George, hoisting himself up on his cushions. 

"I know that �C" 

"Mad-Eye wouldn't want �C" 

"I KNOW!" Harry bellowed. 

He felt beleaguered and blackmailed, did they think he did not know what they had done for 
him, didn't they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now, before 
they had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar 
continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley. 

"Where's Hedwig, Harry?" she said coaxingly. "We can put her up with Pigwidgeon and give 
her something to eat."

��59ҳ��

His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the last of his 
firewhisky to avoid answering. 

"Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry," said Hagrid. "Escaped him, fought him off when he 
was right on top of yeh!" 

"It wasn't me," said Harry flatly. "It was my wand. My wand acted of its own accord." 

After a few moments, Hermione said gently, "But that's impossible, Harry. You mean that you 

did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively." 

"No," said Harry. "The bike was falling, I couldn't have told you where Voldemort was, but my 
wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn't even a spell I 
recognized. I've never made gold flames appear before." 

"Often," said Mr. Weasley, "when you're in a pressured situation you can produce magic you 
never dreamed of. Small children often find, before they're trained �C" 

"It wasn't like that," said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning. He felt angry and 
frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemort's. 

No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he came to think of it, 
he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before. 

His scar seared with pain, it was all he could do not to moan aloud. Muttering about fresh air, he 
set down his glass and left the room. 

As he crossed the yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up �C rustled its enormous batlike wings, 
then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown 
plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore. 

Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would have known how and 
why Harry's wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; he had 
known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand 
and Voldemort's. But Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all 
were gone where Harry could never talk to them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had 
nothing to do with firewhisky. 

And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his forehead and closed 
his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head. 

"You told me the problem would be solved by using another's wand!" 

��60ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated [i'me...e.t] old man lying in rags upon a 

stone floor, screaming, a horrible drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable agony... 

"No! No! I beg you, I beg you ...�� 

"You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!" 

"I did not... I swear I did not... " 

"You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!" 

"I swear I did not... I believed a different wand would work." 

"Explain, then, what happened. Lucius's wand is destroyed!" 

"I cannot understand... The connection ... exists only between your two wands." 

"Lies!" 

"Please ... I beg you... " 

And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger, saw 

the frail old main on the floor writhe in agony �C 

"Harry?" 

It was over as quickly as it had come, Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate 

into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was several moments before he realized 

that Ron and Hermione were at his side. 

"Harry, come back in the house," Hermione whispered, "You aren't still thinking of leaving?" 

"Yeah, you've got to stay, mate," said Ron, thumping Harry on the back. 

"Are you all right?" Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry's face. "You look 

awful!" 

"Well," said Harry shakily, "I probably look better than Ollivander...�� 

When he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appalled, but Hermione 
downright terrified. 

"But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar �C it wasn't supposed to do this anymore! You 
mustn't let that connection open up again �C Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!" 

When he did not reply, she gripped his arm. 

"Harry, he's taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding world! Don't 

let him inside your head too!"

Chapter Six 

The Ghoul in Pajamas 

The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the 


house in the 
days that followed. Harry kept expecting to see him 

stumping in 
through the back door like the other Order 

members, 
who passed in and out to relay news. Harry felt that 

nothing but 
action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to 
find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible. 

��Well, you can��t do anything about the�� �C Ron mouthed the word Horcruxes �C ��till you��re 
seventeen. You��ve still got the Trace on you. And we can plan here as well as anywhere, can��t we? 
Or,�� he dropped his voice to a whisper, ��d��you reckon you already know where the You-Know-
Whats are?�� 

��No,�� Harry admitted. 

��I think Hermione��s been doing a bit of research,�� said Ron. ��She said she was saving it for 
when you got here.�� 

They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just left for work. Mrs. 
Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath. 

��The Trace��ll break on the thirty-first,�� said Harry. ��That means I only need to stay here four 
days. Then I can �C�� 

��Five days,�� Ron corrected him firmly. ��We��ve got to stay for the wedding. They��ll kill us if we 
miss it.�� 

Harry understood ��they�� to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley. 

��It��s one extra day,�� said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous. 

��Don��t they realize how important �C?�� 

����Course they don��t,�� said Ron. ��They haven��t got a clue. And now you mention it, I wanted to 
talk to you about that.�� 

Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then 
leaned in closer to Harry. 

��Mum��s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we��re off to do. She��ll try you next,

��62ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin��ve both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you 
not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She��s determined.�� 

Ron��s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs. Weasley detached Harry 
from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man��s sock that she thought might have come 
out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery (area or room for washing 
dishes and performing messy tasks (British��ϴ��) off the kitchen, she started. 

��Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts,�� she 
began in a light, casual tone. 

��Oh,�� said Harry. ��Well, yeah. We are.�� 

The mangle���»� turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like one of 
Mr. Weasley��s vests. 

��May I ask why you are abandoning your education?�� said Mrs. Weasley. 

��Well, Dumbledore left me ... stuff to do,�� mumbled Harry. ��Ron and Hermione know about it, 

and they want to come too.�� 

��What sort of 'stuf��'?�� 

��I��m sorry, I can��t �C�� 

��Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I��m sure Mr. And Mrs. Granger 

would agree!�� said Mrs. Weasley. 

Harry had been afraid of the ��concerned parent�� attack. He forced himself to look directly into 
her eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny��s. This 
did not help. 

��Dumbledore didn��t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I��m sorry. Ron and Hermione 
don��t have to come, it��s their choice -�� 

��I don��t see that you have to go either!�� she snapped, dropping all pretense now. ��You��re barely 
of age, any of you! It��s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order 
at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you something 
he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you �C�� 

��I didn��t misunderstand,�� said Harry flatly. ��It��s got to be me.�� He handed her back the single 
sock he was supposed to be identifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes. ��And that��s 
not mine. I don��t support Puddlemere United.��

��63ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Oh, of course not,�� said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual 
tone. ��I should have realized. Well, Harry, while we��ve still got you here, you won��t mind helping 
with the preparations for Bill and Fleur��s wedding, will you? There��s still so much to do.�� 

��No �C I �C of course not,�� said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of subject. 

��Sweet of you,�� she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery. 

From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron and Hermione so busy with preparations 
for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think. The kindest explanation of this behavior 
would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the 
terrors of their recent journey. 

After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons and flowers, of 
de-gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canap��s, however, Harry 
started to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him, Ron, 
and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone 
since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander. 

��I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she��ll be 
able to delay you leaving,�� Ginny told Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on 
the third night of his stay. 

��And then what does she think��s going to happen?�� Harry muttered. ��Someone else might kill 

off Voldemort while she��s holding us here making vol-au-vents?�� 

He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny��s face whiten. 

��So it��s true?�� she said. ��That��s what you��re trying to do?�� 

��I �C not �C I was joking,�� said Harry evasively. 

They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny��s expression. 
Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since 
those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was remembering 
them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked 
in. 

They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the Burrow had 
replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that 
after the death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom Dumbledore had

��64ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

confided Grimmauld Place��s location had become a Secret-Keeper in turn. 

��And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm. 
Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We 
can��t expect it to hold much longer.�� 

��But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?�� asked Harry. 

��Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again. We 
hope they��ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about 
the place, but we can��t be sure. It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters 
now that its protection has become so shaky.�� 

The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks. Harry 
found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made 
him wish they had been separated by a few more people. He was trying so hard to avoid brushing 
her arm he could barely cut his chicken. 

��No news about Mad-Eye?�� Harry asked Bill. 

��Nothing,�� replied Bill. 

They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and Lupin had failed to 
recover his body. It had been difficult to know where he might have fallen, given the darkness and 
the confusion of the battle. 

��The Daily Prophet hasn��t said a word about him dying or about finding the body,�� Bill went 
on. ��But that doesn��t mean much. It��s keeping a lot quiet these days.�� 

��And they still haven��t called a hearing about all the underage magic I used escaping the Death 
Eaters?�� Harry called across the table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head. 

��Because they know I had no choice or because they don��t want me to tell the world Voldemort 
attacked me?�� 

��The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn��t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he 
is, nor that Azkaban��s seen a mass breakout.�� 

��Yeah, why tell the public the truth?�� said Harry, clenching his knife so tightly that the faint 
scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin, I must not tell lies. 

��Isn��t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?�� asked Ron angrily. 

��Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,�� Mr. Weasley replied, ��terrified that they will be next

��65ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one 
don��t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn��t been seen for weeks 
now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day; I just hope he��s working on a 
plan.�� 

There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and 
served apple tart. 

��We must decide 'ow you will be disguised, 'Arry,�� said Fleur, once everyone had pudding. ��For 
ze wedding,�� she added, when he looked confused. ��Of course, none of our guests are Death 
Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey 'ave 'ad champagne.�� 

From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid. 

��Yes, good point,�� said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table where she sat, spectacles perched 
on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece 
of parchment. ��Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?�� 

��Why?�� exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. ��Why does my 

room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!�� 

��We are holding your brother��s wedding here in a few days�� time, young man �C�� 

��And are they getting married in my bedroom?�� asked Ron furiously. ��No! So why in the name 

of Merlin��s saggy left �C�� 

��Don��t talk to your mother like that,�� said Mr. Weasley firmly. ��And do as you��re told.�� 

Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of 

his apple tart. 

��I can help, some of it��s my mess.�� Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across him. 

��No, Harry, dear, I��d much rather you helped Arthur muck out (clean out the mud or filth (i.e. 
from a barn, mine, etc.) the chickens, and Hermione, I��d be ever so grateful if you��d change the 
sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they��re arriving at eleven tomorrow 
morning.�� 

But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens. ��There��s no need to, er, mention 
it to Molly,�� Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, ��but, er, Ted Tonks sent me 
most of what was left of Sirius��s bike and, er, I��m hiding �C that��s to say, keeping �C it in here.

it��ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. I��m going to try and put it all back 
together again when Molly��s not �C I mean, when I��ve got time.�� 

When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry slipped 
upstairs to Ron��s attic bedroom. 

��I��m doing it, I��m doing �C ! Oh, it��s you,�� said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room. Ron lay 
back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was just as messy as it had 
been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy 
ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as his own, 
into two enormous piles. 

��Hi, Harry,�� she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. 

��And how did you manage to get away?�� 

��Oh, Ron��s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,�� said 

Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and The Rise and Fall of the 

Dark Arts onto the other. 

��We were just talking about Mad-Eye,�� Ron told Harry. ��I reckon he might have survived.�� 

��But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,�� said Harry. 

��Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,�� said Ron. ��How can he be sure what he saw?�� 

��Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,�� said Hermione, 

now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand. 

��He could have used a Shield Charm �C�� 

��Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,�� said Harry. 

��Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,�� said Ron grumpily, punching his pillow into a 
more comfortable shape. 

��Of course we don��t want him to be dead!�� said Hermione, looking shocked. ��It��s dreadful that 
he��s dead! But we��re being realistic!�� 

For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye��s body, broken as Dumbledore��s had been, yet with 
that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to 
laugh. 

��The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that��s why no one��s found him,�� said 
Ron wisely.

��67ҳ��

��Yeah,�� said Harry. ��Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid��s front garden. 
They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him �C�� 

��Don��t!�� squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears 
over her copy of Spellman��s Syllabary. 

��Oh no,�� said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. ��Hermione, I wasn��t trying to 
upset �C�� 

But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got there first. One 
arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking 
handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he 
pointed it at the rag and said, ��Tergeo.�� 

The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, Ron handed the 
slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione. 

��Oh ... thanks, Ron... I��m sorry... �� She blew her nose and hiccupped. ��It��s just so awf-ful, isn��t 
it? R-right after Dumbledore ... I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so 
tough!�� 

��Yeah, I know,�� said Ron, giving her a squeeze. ��But you know what he��d say to us if he was 

here?�� 

����C-constant vigilance,���� said Hermione, mopping her eyes. 

��That��s right,�� said Ron, nodding. ��He��d tell us to learn from what happened to him. And what 

I��ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.�� 

Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A second later, 
Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders, she had dropped The Monster of 
Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at 
Ron��s ankle. 

��I��m sorry, I��m sorry!�� Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Ron��s leg and retied it 

shut. 

��What are you doing with all those books anyway?�� Ron asked, limping back to his bed. 

��Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,�� said Hermione, ��When we��re looking for the 
Horcruxes.�� 

��Oh, of course,�� said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. ��I forgot we��ll be hunting down

��68ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Voldemort in a mobile library.�� 

��Ha ha,�� said Hermione, looking down at Spellman��s Syllabary. ��I wonder ... will we need to 
translate runes? It��s possible... I think we��d better take it, to be safe.�� 

She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts, A History. 

��Listen,�� said Harry. He had sat up straight. 

Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance. 

��I know you said after Dumbledore��s funeral that you wanted to come with me,�� Harry began. 

��Here he goes,�� Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes. 

��As we knew he would,�� she sighed, turning back to the books. ��You know, I think I will take 

Hogwarts, A History. Even if we��re not going back there, I don��t think I��d feel right if I didn��t have 

it with �C�� 

��Listen!�� said Harry again. 

��No, Harry, you listen,�� said Hermione. ��We��re coming with you. That was decided months ago 

�C years, really.�� 
��But �C�� 
��Shut up,�� Ron advised him. 
���C are you sure you��ve thought this through?�� Harry persisted. 
��Let��s see,�� said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather 
fierce look. ��I��ve been packing for days, so we��re ready to leave at a moment��s notice, which for 
your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling MadEye��s 
whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron��s mum��s nose. 

��I��ve also modified my parents�� memories so that they��re convinced they��re really called 
Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life��s ambition is to move to Australia, which they 
have now done. That��s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate 
them about me �C or you, because unfortunately, I��ve told them quite a bit about you. 

��Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I��ll find Mum and Dad and lift the 
enchantment. If I don��t �C well, I think I��ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. 
Wendell and Monica Wilkins don��t know that they��ve got a daughter, you see.�� 

Hermione��s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put his arm around 
her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not

��69ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else 

tact. 

��I �C Hermione, I��m sorry �C I didn��t �C�� 

��Didn��t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? 

Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you��ve done.�� 

��Nah, he��s just eaten,�� said Ron. 

��Go on, he needs to know!�� 

��Oh, all right. Harry, come here.�� 

For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the 

door. 

��C��mon.�� 

��Why?�� Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing. 

��Descendo,�� muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened right over their 
heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out 
of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains. 

��That��s your ghoul, isn��t it?�� asked Harry, who had never actually met the creature that 
sometimes disrupted the nightly silence. 

��Yeah, it is,�� said Ron, climbing the ladder. ��Come and have a look at him.�� 

Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and shoulders were 

in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the 

gloom with its large mouth wide open. 

��But it ... it looks ... do ghouls normally wear pajamas?�� 

��No,�� said Ron. ��Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustulesŧ��.�� 

Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, and was 
wearing what, now that Harry��s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron��s 
pajamas. He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly 
hairy and covered in angry purple blisters. 

��He��s me, see?�� said Ron. 

��No,�� said Harry. ��I don��t.�� 

��I��ll explain it back in my room, the smell��s getting to me,�� said Ron. They climbed back down

��70ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books. 

��Once we��ve left, the ghoul��s going to come and live down here in my room,�� said Ron. ��I think 
he��s really looking forward to it �C well, it��s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool �C 
but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he��s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?�� 

Harry merely looked his confusion. 

��It is!�� said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan. ��Look, 
when we three don��t turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone��s going to think Hermione and I must be 
with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they��ve 
got information on where you are.�� 

��But hopefully it��ll look like I��ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-borns are 
talking about going into hiding at the moment,�� said Hermione. 

��We can��t hide my whole family, it��ll look too fishy and they can��t all leave their jobs,�� said 
Ron. ��So we��re going to put out the story that I��m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I 
can��t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the 
ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit��s really contagious, so they��re not going to want 
to go near him. It won��t matter that he can��t say anything, either, because apparently you can��t 
once the fungus has spread to your uvulaС��.�� 

��And your mum and dad are in on this plan?�� asked Harry. 

��Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum ... well, you��ve seen what she��s 
like. She won��t accept we��re going till we��re gone.�� 

There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione continued to throw 
books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other, 
unable to say anything. The measure they had taken to protect their families made him realize, 
more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with him and that 
they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, 
but he simply could not find words important enough. 

Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four floors below. 

��Ginny��s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,�� said Ron. ��I dunno why the 
Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.�� 

��Fleur��s sister��s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she��s too young to

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

come on her own,�� said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee. 

��Well, guests aren��t going to help Mum��s stress levels,�� said Ron. 

��What we really need to decide,�� said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin 
without a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, ��is where 
we��re going after we leave here. I know you said you wanted to go to Godric��s Hollow first, Harry, 
and I understand why, but ... well ... shouldn��t we make the Horcruxes our priority?�� 

��If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I��d agree with you,�� said Harry, who did not 
believe that Hermione really understood his desire to return to Godric��s Hollow. His parents�� 
graves were only part of the attraction, He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place 
held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemort��s 
Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the 
place where it had happened, wanting to understand. 

��Don��t you think there��s a possibility that Voldemort��s keeping a watch on Godric��s Hollow?�� 
Hermione asked. ��He might expect you to go back and visit your parents�� graves once you��re free 
to go wherever you like?�� 

This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a counterargument, Ron spoke up, 

evidently following his own train of thought. 

��This R.A.B. person,�� he said. ��You know, the one who stole the real locket?�� 

Hermione nodded. 

��He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn��t he?�� 

Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.��s note 

was still folded. 

����I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.���� Harry read out. 

��Well, what if he did finish it off?�� said Ron. 

��Or she.�� Interposed Hermione. 

��Whichever,�� said Ron. ��it��d be one less for us to do!�� 

��Yes, but we��re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren��t we?�� said Hermione, 

��to find out whether or not it��s destroyed.�� 

��And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?�� asked Ron. 

��Well,�� said Hermione, ��I��ve been researching that.��

��72ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��How?�� asked Harry. ��I didn��t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library?�� 

��There weren��t,�� said Hermione, who had turned pink. ��Dumbledore removed them all, but he �C 
he didn��t destroy them.�� 

Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed. ��How in the name of Merlin��s pants have you managed to get 
your hands on those Horcrux books?�� 

��It �C it wasn��t stealing!�� said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. 
��They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he 
really didn��t want anyone to get at them, I��m sure he would have made it much harder to �C�� 

��Get to the point!�� said Ron. 

��Well ... it was easy,�� said Hermione in a small voice. ��I just did a Summoning Charm. You 
know �C Accio. And �C they zoomed out of Dumbledore��s study window right into the girls�� 
dormitory.�� 

��But when did you do this?�� Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and 
incredulity. 

��Just after his �C Dumbledore��s �C funeral,�� said Hermione in an even smaller voice. ��Right after 
we agreed we��d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get 
my things it ... it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be ... 
and I was alone in there ... so I tried ... and it worked. They flew straight in through the open 
window and I �C I packed them.�� 

She swallowed and then said imploringly, ��I can��t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, 

it��s not as though we��re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?�� 

��Can you hear us complaining?�� said Ron. ��Where are these books anyway?�� 

Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume, bound in 
faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something 
recently dead. 

��This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the 
Darkest Art �C it��s a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore 
removed it from the library... if he didn��t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the 
instruction he needed from here.�� 

��Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he��d already read that?��

��73ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

asked Ron. 

��He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,�� 
said Harry. ��Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he 
asked Slughorn about them. I think you��re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he 
got the information.�� 

��And the more I��ve read about them,�� said Hermione, ��the more horrible they seem, and the less 
I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of 
your soul by ripping it, and that��s just by making one Horcrux!�� 

Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond ��usual evil.�� 

��Isn��t there any way of putting yourself back together?�� Ron asked. 

��Yes,�� said Hermione with a hollow smile, ��but it would be excruciatingly painful.�� 

��Why? How do you do it?�� asked Harry. 

��Remorse,�� said Hermione. ��You��ve got to really feel what you��ve done. There��s a footnote. 
Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can��t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?�� 

��No,�� said Ron, before Harry could answer. ��So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that 
book?�� 

��Yes,�� said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, ��because it 
warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I��ve 
read, what Harry did to Riddle��s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a 
Horcrux.�� 

��What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?�� asked Harry. 

��Oh well, lucky we��ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,�� said Ron. ��I was 
wondering what we were going to do with them.�� 

��It doesn��t have to be a basilisk fang,�� said Hermione patiently. ��It has to be something so 
destructive that the Horcrux can��t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it��s 
incredibly rare �C�� 

���C phoenix tears,�� said Harry, nodding. 

��Exactly,�� said Hermione. ��Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as 
basilisk venom, and they��re all dangerous to carry around with you. That��s a problem we��re going 
to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won��t do the trick.

��74ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

You��ve got to put it beyond magical repair.�� 

��But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,�� said Ron, ��why can��t the bit of soul in it just go and 
live in something else?�� 

��Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.�� 

Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. ��Look, if I picked 

up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn��t damage your soul at all.�� 

��Which would be a real comfort to me, I��m sure,�� said Ron. 

Harry laughed. 

��It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will 
survive, untouched,�� said Hermione. ��But it��s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment 
of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can��t exist without it.�� 

��That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,�� said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood 
from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort��s soul as it vanished. 

��And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. 
Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back 
good as new.�� 

��Hang on,�� said Ron, frowning. ��The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn��t it? 
How does that work, then?�� 

��While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone 
if they get too close to the object. I don��t mean holding it for too long, it��s nothing to do with 
touching it,�� she added before Ron could speak. ��I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her 
heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You��re in trouble if you get too 
fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.�� 

��I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?�� said Harry. ��Why didn��t I ask him? I never 
really ...�� 

His voice trailed away, He was thinking of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore, and 
of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many 
opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more ... to find out everything ... 

The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking crash. Hermione 
shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing

��75ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and 
smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing 
that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted 
with rage. 

��I��m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,�� she said, her voice trembling. ��I��m sure you 
all need your rest ... but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I 
was under the impression that you had agreed to help.�� 

��Oh yes,�� said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet, sending books flying in every 
direction. ��we will ... we��re sorry ...�� 

With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after Mrs. 
Weasley. 

��It��s like being a house-elf,�� complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his head as he and 
Harry followed. ��Except without the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding��s over, the happier 
I��ll be.�� 

��Yeah,�� said Harry, ��then we��ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes... It��ll be like a 
holiday, won��t it?�� 

Ron started to laugh, but, at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them 
in Mrs. Weasley��s room, stopped quite abruptly. 

The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o�� clock. Harry, Ron, Hermione and 
Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur��s family by this time; and it was with ill grace that 
Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his hair. Once 
they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the 
visitors. 

Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots 
that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes 
standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, 
giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and 
the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked 
it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent (group) 
of capering gnomes.

��76ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the Burrow by both 
the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by 
magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a 
nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an 
unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at 
the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf 
green robes, who could be Fleur��s mother. 

��Mama!�� cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. ��Papa!�� 

Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head shorter and 
extremely plump, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing 
towards Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her 
flustered. 

��You 'ave been so much trouble,�� he said in a deep voice. ��Fleur tells us you 'ave been working 

very 'ard.�� 

��Oh, it��s been nothing, nothing!�� trilled Mrs. Weasley. ��No trouble at all!�� 

Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of 

the new Flutterby bushes. 

��Dear lady!�� said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley��s hand between his own two 
plump ones and beaming. ��We are most honored at the approaching union of our two families! Let 
me present my wife, Apolline.�� 

Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too. 

��Enchant��e,�� she said. ��Your 'usband 'as been telling us such amusing stories!�� 

Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look, upon which he became 
immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend. 

��And, of course, you 'ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!�� said Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle 
was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave 
Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her 
eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly. 

��Well, come in, do!�� said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours into the house, 
with many "No, please!"s and "After you! "s and "Not at all!"s. 

��77ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were pleased with 
everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour 
pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids�� shoes ��Charmant!�� Madame 
Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice 
(quickly, immediately); Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she 
could and jabbering away in rapid French. 

On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame 
Delacour��s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in 
Percy��s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from 
Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in 
desperation that Harry, Ron and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape 
the overcrowded house. 

��But she still won��t leave us alone!�� snarled Ron, and their second attempt at a meeting in the 
yard was foiled (frustrate) by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in 
her arms. 

��Oh, good, you��ve fed the chickens,�� she called as she approached them. ��We��d better shut them 
away again before the men arrive tomorrow ... to put up the tent for the wedding,�� she explained, 
pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. ��Millamant��s Magic Marquees����
Ļ;���� ... they��re very good. Bill��s escorting them... You��d better stay inside while they��re here, 
Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these security spells around 
the place.�� 

��I��m sorry,�� said Harry humbly. 

��Oh, don��t be silly, dear!�� said Mrs. Weasley at once. ��I didn��t mean �C well, your safety��s much 
more important! Actually, I��ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, 
Harry. Seventeen, after all, it��s an important day... " 

��I don��t want a fuss,�� said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional strain this would put on 
them all. ��Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine... It��s the day before the 
wedding... �� 

��Oh, well, if you��re sure, dear. I��ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid?��

��78ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��That��d be great,�� said Harry. ��But please, don��t go to loads of trouble.�� 

��Not at all, not at all ... It��s no trouble... �� 

She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened up, and walked 
away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into 
the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience 
and the pain he was giving her.

Chapter Seven 
The Will of Albus Dumbledore 


He was walking along a mountain road in the 


cool blue light 
of dawn. Far below, swathed (wrap, envelop) in 

mist, was the 
shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought 

down there, the 
man he needed so badly he could think of little 

else, the man 
who held the answer, the answer to his problem... 

? 
"Oi, wake up." 
Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on 


the camp bed in 
Ron's dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was 
asleep with his head under his tiny wing. The scar on Harry's forehead was prickling. 

"You were muttering in your sleep." 

"Was I?" 

"Yeah. 'Gregorovitch.' You kept saying 'Gregorovitch.'" 

Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron's face appeared slightly blurred. 

"Who's Gregorovitch?" 

"I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it." 

Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name before, but he 
could not think where. 

"I think Voldemort's looking for him." 

"Poor bloke," said Ron fervently. 

Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember exactly what he had 

seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little 

village cradled in a deep valley. 

"I think he's abroad." 

"Who, Gregorovitch?" 

"Voldemort. I think he's somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn't look like 
anywhere in Britain." 

"You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?" Ron sounded worried.

"Do me a favor and don't tell Hermione," said Harry. "Although how she expects me to stop 

seeing stuff in my sleep...�� 

He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon's cage, thinking... Why was the name "Gregorovitch" familiar? 

"I think," he said slowly, "he's got something to do with Quidditch. There's some connection, 

but I can't... I can't think what it is." 

"Quidditch?" said Ron. "Sure you're not thinking of Gorgovitch?" 

"Who?" 

"Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years 

ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season." 

"No," said Harry. "I'm definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch." 

"I try not to either," said Ron. "Well, happy birthday anyway." 

"Wow, that's right, I forgot! I'm seventeen!" 

Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had 
left his glasses, and said, "Accio Glasses!" Although they were only around a foot away, there was 
something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, at least until they poked him 
in the eye. 

"Slick," snorted Ron. 

Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron's possessions flying around the room, 
causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry also tried tying the 
laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely 
for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron's Chudley Cannons posters bright blue. 

"I'd do your fly by hand, though," Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry immediately 
checked it. "Here's your present. Unwrap it up here, it's not for my mother's eyes." 

"A book?" said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. "Bit of a departure from tradition, isn't 
it?" 

"This isn't your average book," said Ron. "It'd pure gold, Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm 
Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I'd had this last year I'd have 
known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would've known how to get going with... Well, 
Fred and George gave me a copy, and I've learned a lot. You'd be surprised, it's not all about 
wandwork, either."

When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. Bill and 
Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them 
over the frying pan. 

"Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry," said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. 
"He had to leave early for work, but he'll be back for dinner. That's our present on top." 

Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. Inside was a watch 
very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars 
circling around the face instead of hands. 

"It's traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age," said Mrs. Weasley, watching 
him anxiously from beside the cooker. "I'm afraid that one isn't new like Ron's, it was actually my 
brother Fabian's and he wasn't terribly careful with his possessions, it's a bit dented on the back, 
but-" 

The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put a lot of unsaid 
things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted his cheek clumsily when 
he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to 
flop out of the frying pan onto the floor. 

"Happy birthday, Harry!" said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present 
to the top of the pile. "It's not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?" she added to 
Ron, who seemed not to hear her. 

"Come on, then, open Hermione's!" said Ron. 

She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an enchanted razor from 
Bill and Fleur ("Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever 'ave," Monsieur 
Delacour assured him, "but you must tell it clearly what you want... ozzerwise you might find you 
'ave a leetle less hair zan you would like...��), chocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box 
of the latest Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, 
and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. 

"I'll pack these for you," Hermione said brightly, taking Harry's presents out of his arms as the 
three of them headed back upstairs. "I'm nearly done, I'm just waiting for the rest of your 
underpants to come out of the wash, Ron -"

Ron's splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing. 

"Harry, will you come in here a moment?" 

It was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him 
on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room. 

He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large poster of the 
Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-
witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window, 
which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played a two-a-side Quidditch 
with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on 
top was level with Ginny's window. 

Ginny looked up into Harry's face, took a deep breath, and said, "Happy seventeenth." 

"Yeah... thanks." 

She was looking at him steadily; he however, found it difficult to look back at her; it was like 
gazing into a brilliant light. 

"Nice view," he said feebly, pointing toward with window. 

She ignored this. He could not blame her. 

"I couldn't think what to get you," she said. 

"You didn't have to get me anything." 

She disregarded this too. "I didn't know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you 

wouldn't be able to take it with you." 

He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things 
about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have 
toughened her up. 

She took a step closer to him. 

"So then I thought, I'd like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet 
some veela when you're off doing whatever you're doing." 

"I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest." 

"There's the silver lining (ʧ�������е� )һ��ϣ�� /ο�壩 I've been looking for," she 
whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was 
kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in

��83ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair-

The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. 

"Oh," said Ron pointedly. "Sorry." 

"Ron!" Hermione was just behind him, slight out of breath. There was a strained silence, then 

Ginny had said in a flat little voice, "Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry." 

Ron's ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, 
but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened, and his shining 
moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for 
staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy 
forgetfulness was gone. 

He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but she had turned 
her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do 
anything to comfort her in front of Ron. 

"I'll see you later," he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. 

Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and Harry kept 
pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking scared. 

Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry. 

"You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?" 

"I'm not messing her around," said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them. 

"Ron-" 

But Ron held up a hand to silence her. 

"She was really cut up when you ended it -" 

"So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn't because I wanted to." 

"Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she's just going to get her hopes up again-" 

"She's not an idiot, she knows it can't happen, she's not expecting us to... to end up married, or -" 

As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry's mind of Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, 
faceless, and unpleasant stranger. 

In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him, her future was free and unencumbered, whereas 
his... he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead. 

"If you keep groping her every chance you get -" 

��84ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"It won't happen again," said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as though the sun 
had gone in. "Okay?" 

Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a 
moment, then said, "Right then, well, that's... yeah." 

Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, nor by any 
look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. 
Nevertheless, Charlie's arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. 
Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about 
to get a proper haircut. 

As Harry's birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow's kitchen to breaking point even 
before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in 
the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns all emblazoned with a large 
number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley's ministrations, George's 
wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head, 
despite the twins' many jokes about it. 

Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves 
artistically over the trees and bushes. 

"Nice," said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the 
crabapple tree to gold. "You've really got an eye for that sort of thing." 

"Thank you, Ron!" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry turned 
away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments 
when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; he caught 
Ginny's eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a 
conversation with Monsieur Delacour. 

"Out of the way, out of the way!" sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate with what 
appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realized 
that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk 
carrying it over the uneven ground. 

When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, "That looks amazing, 
Mrs. Weasley."

"Oh, it's nothing, dear," she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and 
mouthed, Good one. 

By seven o'clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had 
waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best, and 
horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry's hand, Harry thought he 
looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant. 

"Happy birthday, Harry," she said, hugging him tightly. 

"Seventeen, eh!" said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from Fred. "Six years 
ter the day since we met, Harry, d'yeh remember it?" 

"Vaguely," said Harry, grinning up at him. "Didn't you smash down the front door, give Dudley 
a pig's tail, and tell me I was a wizard?" 

"I forge' the details," Hagrid chortled. "All righ', Ron, Hermione?" 

"We're fine," said Hermione. "How are you?" 

"Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns. I'll show yeh when yeh get back -" 
Harry avoided Ron's and Hermione's gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. "Here. Harry, 
couldn't think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this." He pulled out a small, slightly furry 
drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. "Mokeskin. 
Hide anythin' in there an' no one but the owner can get it out. They're rare, them." 

"Hagrid, thanks!" 

"'S'nothin'," said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. "An' there's Charlie! Always 
liked him. Hey! Charlie!" 

Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, brutally short haircut. He 
was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his muscled arms. 

"Hi, Hagrid, how's it going?" 

"Bin meanin' ter write fer ages. How's Norbert doin'?" 

"Norbert?" Charlie laughed. "The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Norberta now." 

"Wha, Norbert's a girl?" 

"Oh yeah," said Charlie. 

"How can you tell?" asked Hermione. 

"They're a lot more vicious," said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice.

"Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum's getting edgy." 

They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while 
glancing repeatedly at the gate. 

"I think we'd better start without Arthur," she called to the garden at large after a moment or 
two. "He must have been held up at... oh!" 

They all saw it at the same time, a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the 
table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke 
with Mr. Weasley's voice. 

"Minister of Magic coming with me." 

The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur's family peering in astonishment at the place 
where it had vanished. 

"We shouldn't be here," said Lupin at once. "Harry, I'm sorry, I'll explain some other time." 

He seized Tonks��s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence, climbed over it, and 

vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. 

"The Minister, but why? I don't understand -" 

But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of 
thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of 
grizzled hair. 

The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern-lit table, where 
everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the 
lantern light. Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy������ 
and grim. 

"Sorry to intrude," said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. "Especially as I can 

see that I am gate-crashing a party." 

His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. "Many happy returns." 

"Thanks," said Harry. 

"I require a private word with you," Scrimgeour went on. "Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and 

Miss Hermione Granger." 

"Us?" said Ron, sounding surprised. "Why us?" 

"I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private," said Scrimgeour. "Is there such a

��87ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

place?" he demanded of Mr. Weasley. 

"Yes, of course," said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. "The, er, sitting room, why don't you 
use that?" 

"You can lead the way," Scrimgeour said to Ron. "There will be no need for you to accompany 
us, Arthur." 

Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, and Hermione 
stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two were 
thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were 
planning to drop out of Hogwarts. 

Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into the Burrow's 
sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in 
here; Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but 
cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, 
leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. 

Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke. "I have some questions for the three of you, and I 
think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two" -he pointed at Harry and Hermione -"can 
wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald." 

"We're not going anywhere," said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. "You can speak to 
us together, or not at all." 

Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that the Minister was 
wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early. 

"Very well then, together," he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. "I am here, as I'm sure you 
know, because of Albus Dumbledore's will." 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. 

"A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you anything?" 

"A-all of us?" said Ron, "Me and Hermione too?" 

"Yes, all of -" 

But Harry interrupted. "Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give 
us what he left us?" 

"Isn't it obvious?" said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. "They wanted to examine

��88ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

whatever he's left us. You had no right to do that!" she said, and her voice trembled slightly. 

"I had every right," said Scrimgeour dismissively. "The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation 
gives the Ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a will -" 

"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts," said Hermione, "and the 
Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions are illegal before 
seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something 
cursed?" 

"Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?" asked Scrimgeour. 

"No, I'm not," retorted Hermione. "I'm hoping to do some good in the world!" 

Ron laughed. Scrimgeour's eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry spoke. 

"So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can't think of a pretext to keep them?" 

"No, it'll be because thirty-one days are up," said Hermione at once. "They can't keep the objects 
longer than that unless they can prove they're dangerous. Right?" 

"Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?" asked Scrimgeour, ignoring 

Hermione. 

Ron looked startled. "Me? Not, not really... It was always Harry who...�� 

Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-talking-now! sort 
of look, but the damage was done. 

Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. 
He swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron's answer. 

"If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered 
you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions 
-his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects 
(personal property, private 
belongings) - were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?" 

"I... dunno," said Ron. "I... when I say we weren't close... I mean, I think he liked me..." 

"You're being modest, Ron," said Hermione. "Dumbledore was very fond of you." 

This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had 
never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been negligible. 

However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew 
out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a

��89ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud. 

"'The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore'... Yes, here we 
are... 'To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me 
when he uses it.'" 

Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before, it looked something like a 
silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, 
with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it 
and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned. 

"That is a valuable object," said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. "It may even be unique. Certainly it 

is of Dumbledore's own design. Why would he have left you an item so rare?" 

Ron shook his head, looking bewildered. 

"Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students," Scrimgeour persevered. "Yet the only 

ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put 

to the Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?" 

"Put out lights, I s'pose," mumbled Ron. "What else could I do with it?" 

Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or two, he 
turned back to Dumbledore's will. 

"'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope 
that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'" 

Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets 
of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its bindingװ�� was stained and peeling in places. Hermione took it 
from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the 
title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the 
embossed symbols. 

"Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?" asked Scrimgeour. 

"He... he knew I liked books," said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve. 

"But why that particular book?" 

"I don't know. He must have thought I'd enjoy it." 

"Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with Dumbledore?" 

"No, I didn't," said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. "And if the Ministry hasn't

��90ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will." 

She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had difficulty extracting 
his arm to put it around Hermione's shoulders. Scrimgeour turned back to the will. 

"'To Harry James Potter,'" he read, and Harry's insides contracted with a sudden excitement, "'I 
leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards 
of perseverance and skill.'" 

As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather 

feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax����ɨ�˵Ľ�β. 

"Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?" asked Scrimgeour. 

"No idea," said Harry. "For the reasons you just read out, I suppose... to remind me what you 

can get if you... persevere and whatever it was." 

"You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?" 

"I suppose so," said Harry. "What else could it be?" 

"I'm asking the questions," said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk 
was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the 
hedge. 

"I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch," Scrimgeour said to Harry. "Why is 
that?" 

Hermione laughed derisively. "Oh, it can't be a reference to the fact Harry's a great Seeker, that's 
way too obvious," she said. "There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the 
icing!" 

"I don't think there's anything hidden in the icing," said Scrimgeour, "but a Snitch would be a 

very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I'm sure?" 

Harry shrugged. 

Hermione, however, answered. 

Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could 

not suppress the urge. 

"Because Snitches have flesh memories," she said. 

"What?" said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione's Quidditch knowledge 

negligible.

��91ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Correct," said Scrimgeour. "A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released, not even 
by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human 
to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch" -he held up the tiny golden ball "
will remember your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical 
skill whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you." 

Harry's heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How could he 
avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister? 

"You don't say anything," said Scrimgeour. "Perhaps you already know what the Snitch 
contains?" 

"No," said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing 
so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione's mind; he could 
practically hear her brain whizzing beside him. 

"Take it," said Scrimgeour quietly. 

Harry met the Minister's yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He held out his 
hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and place the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into 
Harry's palm. 

Nothing happened. As Harry's fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and 
were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed 
ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way. 

"That was dramatic," said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laughed. 

"That's all, then, is it?" asked Hermione, making to raise herself off the sofa. 

"Not quite," said Scrimgeour, who looked bad tempered now. "Dumbledore left you a second 
bequest, Potter." 

"What is it?" asked Harry, excitement rekindling. 

Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time. 

"The sword of Godric Gryffindor," he said. 

Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but 
Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too 
small to contain it. 

"So where is it?" Harry asked suspiciously.

"Unfortunately," said Scrimgeour, "that sword was not Dumbledore's to give away. The sword 
of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, belongs -" 

"It belongs to Harry!" said Hermione hotly. "It chose him, he was the one who found it, it came 
to him out of the Sorting Hat -" 

"According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any worthy 
Gryffindor," said Scrimgeour. "That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, 
whatever Dumbledore may have decided." Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, 
scrutinizing Harry. "Why do you think -?" 

"-Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?" said Harry, struggling to keep his temper. "Maybe 
he thought it would look nice on my wall." 

"This is not a joke, Potter!" growled Scrimgeour. "Was it because Dumbledore believed that 
only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you 
that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy HeWho-
Must-Not-Be-Named?" 

"Interesting theory," said Harry. "Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe 
the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down 
Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So this is what you've been doing, Minister, 
shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying �C I was nearly one of them 

�C Voldemort chased me across three counties, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there's no word 
about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!" 
"You go too far!" shouted Scrimgeour, standing up, Harry jumped to his feet too. Scrimgeour 
limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand; it singed a hole 
in Harry's T-shirt like a lit cigarette. 

"Oi!" said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said, "No! D'you want to give 
him an excuse to arrest us?" 

"Remembered you're not at school, have you?" said Scrimgeour breathing hard into Harry's 
face. "Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? 
You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me 
how to do my job! It's time you learned some respect!" 

"It's time you earned it." said Harry.

The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the sitting room 
burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in. 

"We... we thought we heard -" began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of 
Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose. 

"- raised voices," panted Mrs. Weasley. 

Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had made in Harry's 
T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper. 

"It �C it was nothing," he growled. "I ... regret your attitude," he said, looking Harry full in the 
face once more. "You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you �C what Dumbledore 

�C desired. We ought to work together." 
"I don't like your methods, Minister," said Harry. "Remember?" 
For the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scar that still 
showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies . Scrimgeour's expression hardened. He 
turned away without another word and limped from the room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; 
Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so she called, "He's gone!" 

"What did he want?" Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. 
Weasley came hurrying back to them. 

"To give us what Dumbledore left us," said Harry. "They've only just released the content of his 
will." 

Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had given them were 
passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the 
Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them 
could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. 
Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, 
"Harry, dear, everyone's awfully hungry we didn't like to start without you... Shall I serve dinner 
now?" 

They all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of "Happy Birthday" and much 
gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but 
was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a 
neighboring field.

542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Meet us upstairs," Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the 
garden to its normal state. "After everyone's gone to bed." 

Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid's mokeskin purse, 
not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them 
were, the Marauder's Map, the shard of Sirius's enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.'s locket. He pulled 
the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching 
its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside. 

"Muffiato," she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs. 

"Thought you didn't approve of that spell?" said Ron. 

"Times change," said Hermione. "Now, show us that Deluminator." 

Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit 
went out at once. 

"The thing is," whispered Hermione through the dark, "we could have achieved that with 
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder." 

There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and 
illuminated them all once more. 

"Still, it's cool," said Ron, a little defensively. "And from what they said, Dumbledore invented 
it himself!" 

"I know, but, surely he wouldn't have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the 
lights!" 

"D'you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he'd left 
us?" asked Harry. 

"Definitely," said Hermione. "He couldn't tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, 
but that will doesn't explain -�� 

"- why he couldn't have given us a hint when he was alive?" asked Ron. 

"Well, exactly," said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the Bard. "If these 
things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you'd think he'd have 
left us know why... unless he thought it was obvious?" 

"Thought wrong, then, didn't he?" said Ron. "I always said he was mental. Brilliant and 
everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch �C what the hell was that about?" 

��95ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I've no idea," said Hermione. "When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that 
something was going to happen!" 

"Yeah, well," said Harry, his pulse quickened as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. "I wasn't 
going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?" 

"What do you mean?" asked Hermione. 

"The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?" said Harry. "Don't you remember?" 

Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically from Harry to the 

Snitch and back again until he found his voice. "That was the one you nearly swallowed!" 

"Exactly," said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch. 

It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him, He lowered the 

golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out. 

"Writing! There's writing on it, quick, look!" He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and 
excitement. Hermione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds 
before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanted handwriting that Harry 
recognized as Dumbledore's: 

I open at the close. 

He had barely read them when the words vanished again. 

"'I open at the close...' What's that supposed to mean?" 

Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank. 

"I open at the close... at the close... I open at the close...�� 

But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, they were 
unable to wring any more meaning from them. 

"And the sword," said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divineռ

��;�Ʋ� meaning in the Snitch's inscription. 

"Why did he want Harry to have the sword?" 

"And why couldn't he just have told me?" Harry said quietly. "I was there, it was right there on 
the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn't he just 
give it to me then?" 

He felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able 
to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there something he had missed in

��96ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore 
expected him to understand? 

"And as for this book." Said Hermione, "The Tales of Beedle the Bard ... I've never even heard 
of them!" 

"You've never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?" said Ron incredulously. "You're kidding, 
right?" 

"No, I'm not," said Hermione in surprise. "Do you know them then?" 

"Well, of course I do!" 

Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not 

was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise. 

"Oh come on! All the old kids' stories are supposed to be Beedle's aren't they? 'The Fountain of 
Fair Fortune' ... 'The Wizard and the Hopping Pot'... 'Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling 
Stump'..." 

"Excuse me?" said Hermione giggling. "What was the last one?" 

"Come off it!" said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione. "You must've heard of 
Babbitty Rabbitty �C" 

"Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!" said Hermione. "We didn't 
hear stories like that when we were little, we heard 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves' and 
'Cinderella' �C" 

"What's that, an illness?" asked Ron. 

"So these are children's stories?" asked Hermione, bending against over the runes. 

"Yeah." Said Ron uncertainly. "I mean, just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories 
came from Beedle. I dunno what they're like in the original versions." 

"But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?" 

Something cracked downstairs. 

"Probably just Charlie, now Mum's asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair," said Ron nervously. 

"All the same, we should get to bed," whispered Hermione. "It wouldn't do to oversleep 
tomorrow." 

"No," agreed Ron. "A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom's mother might put a bit of damper 
on the wedding. I'll get the light."

Chapter Eight 

The Wedding 

Three o��clock on the following afternoon found 


Harry, 
Ron, Fred and George standing outside the great white 

marquee 
in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding 

guests. 
Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and 

was now 
the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local 

village, 
Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a 

Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as ��Cousin Barny�� and trust to the great 
number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him. 

All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right 
seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden jacketed band, 
and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree. Harry could see a 
blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed 
rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting 
poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous 
bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband 
and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry 
was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting��װ was slightly 
fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer��s day. 

��When I get married,�� said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, ��I won��t be bothering 
with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I��ll put a full Body Bind Curse on 
Mum until it��s all over.�� 

��She wasn��t too bad this morning, considering,�� said George. ��Cried a bit about Percy not 
being here, but who wants him. Oh blimey, brace yourselves, here they come, look.�� 

Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of 
the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through the 
garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches�� hats, 
while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards�� cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew

��99ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent. 

��Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,�� said George, craning his neck for a better look. 
��They��ll need help understanding our English customs, I��ll look after them.�� 

��Not so fast, Your Holeyness,�� said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches 
heading for the procession, he said, ��Here �C permetiez moi to assister vous,�� to a pair of pretty 
French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George was left to deal with the 
middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley��s old Ministry-colleague Perkins, while 
a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry��s lot. 

��Wotcher,�� said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and 
Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. ��Arthur told us you were 
the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,�� she added in a whisper as Harry led them up 
the aisle. ��The Ministry��s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence 
might not do you any favors.�� 

��It��s fine, I understand,�� said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a 
swift smile, but as they turned away Harry saw Lupin��s face fall again into lines of misery. He did 
not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter. Hagrid was causing a certain 
amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred��s directions as he had sat himself, not upon the 
magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five sets that now 
resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks. 

While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would 
listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking 
wizard. Slightly cross-eyedб�ӵ�;�����۵�, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candy 
floss (British) cotton candy, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of 
an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened 
from a golden chain around his neck. 

��Xenophilius Lovegood,�� he said, extending a hand to Harry, ��my daughter and I live just over 
the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?�� he added to 
Ron. 

 ��Yes,�� said Ron. ��Isn��t she with you?�� 

��She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious

��100ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes �C or, 
to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.�� 

��Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,�� said Ron, ��but I think Fred and George taught 
them those.��

 He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. 

 ��Hello, Harry!�� she said. 

 ��Er �C my name��s Barry,�� said Harry, flummoxed. (Slang) confuse

 ��Oh, have you changed that too?�� she asked brightly.

 ��How did you know -?��

 ��Oh, just your expression,�� she said. 

Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had accessorized with a large 
sunflower in her hair. Once you get over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite 
pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears. 

Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange 
between Luna and Harry. Biding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her 
finger and said, ��Daddy, look �C one of the gnomes actually bit me.�� 

��How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial.�� Said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna��s 
outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks. ��Luna, my love, if you should 
feel any burgeoning��ѿ talent today �C perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims 
in Mermish �C do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!��

 Ron, passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort. 

��Ron can laugh,�� said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, ��but 
my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.�� 

��Really?�� said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father��s peculiar 
views. ��Are you sure you don��t want to put anything on that bite, though?�� 

��Oh, it��s fine,�� said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and 
down. ��You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he 
believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.�� 

As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm. Her 
beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo

��101ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

���. 

��... and your hair��s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin��s 
beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?�� she 
barked at Harry.

 ��Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.�� 

��Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn��t Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. 
I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?��

 ��No �C he couldn��t come �C�� 

��Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I��ve 
just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,�� she shouted at Harry. ��Goblin-made, 
you know, and been in my family for centuries. She��s a good-looking girl, but still �C French. Well, 
well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too 
long.�� 

Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time. When next 
they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The Marquee was 
nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside. 

��Nightmare, Muriel is,�� said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. ��She used to come for 
Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a 
Dungbomb under her chair at diner. Dad always says she��ll have written them out of her will �C like 
they care, they��re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they��re going... Wow,�� he 
added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. ��You look great!�� 

��Always the tone of surprise,�� said Hermione, though she smiled. She was wearing a floaty, 
lilac�϶��� ,����ɫ -colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. ��Your 
Great-Aunt Muriel doesn��t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She 
said, 'Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?' and then, 'Bad posture and skinny ankles.'��

 ��Don��t take it personally, she��s rude to everyone,�� said Ron. 

��Talking about Muriel?�� inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred. ��Yeah, 
she��s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; 
he was a right laugh at weddings.��

 ��Wasn��t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?�� asked Hermione.

��102ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,�� conceded George. 

��But before he went loopy (crazy) he was the life and soul of the party,�� said Fred. ��He used to 
down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start 
pulling bunches of flowers out of his �C��

 ��Yes, he sounds a real charmer,�� said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter.

 ��Never married, for some reason,�� said Ron. 

 ��You amaze me,�� said Hermione. 

They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young 
man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and 
said, with his eyes on Hermione, ��You look vunderful.�� 

��Viktor!�� she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite 
disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said ��I didn��t know you 
were �C goodness �C it��s lovely to see �C how are you?�� 

Ron��s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum��s invitation as if he did not 

believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, ��how come you��re here?��

 ��Fleur invited me,�� said Krum, eyebrows raised. 

Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then feeling that it would be prudent to 
remove Krum from Ron��s vicinity, offered to show him his seat. 

��Your friend is not pleased to see me,�� said Krum, as they entered the now packed marquee. 
��Or is he a relative?�� he added with a glance at Harry��s red curly hair.

 ��Cousin.�� Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appearance was causing a stir, 
particularly amongst the veela cousins, He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people 
were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came 
hurrying down the aisle.

 ��Time to sit down,�� Fred told Harry, ��or we��re going to get run over by the bride.�� 

Harry, Ron and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George. 
Hermione looked rather pink and Ron��s ears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to 
Harry, ��Did you see he��s grown a stupid little beard?��

 Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. 

A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring broken by

��103ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and 
waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst��ˮ�� , colored robes 
with a matching hat. 

A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, 
with larger white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of 
giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to 
be the golden balloons. 

 ��Ooooh!�� said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. 

A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour 
and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. 
Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. 
While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it 
fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual and 
once Fleur had reached for him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrit Greyback. 

��Ladies and gentlemen,�� said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, Harry saw the 
same small, tufty-hired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore��s funeral, now standing in front of 
Bill and Fleur. ��We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls...�� 

��Yes, my tiara set off the whole thing nicely,�� said Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. 
��But I must say, Ginevra��s dress is far too low cut.�� 

Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry��s 
mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to the afternoons spent alone with Ginny in 
lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to 
be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person��s life, a person without 
a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead... . 

 ��Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle ...?�� 

In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of 
lace. Trumpet-like sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out 
one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned around and beamed at Harry; her 
eyes too were full of tears. 

 ��... then I declare you bonded for life.��

��104ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The tufty-haired wizard waved his hand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of 
silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a 
round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst. Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew 
and floated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din. 

 ��Ladies and gentlemen!�� called the tufty-haired wizard. ��If you would please stand up!�� 

They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The seats on 
which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee 
vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of 
the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center 
of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small, 
white-clothed tables, which all floated gracefully back to earth round it, and the golden-jacketed 
band trooped toward a podium. 

��Smooth,�� said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some bearing silver 
trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches. 

��We should go and congratulate them!�� said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place 
where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers. 

��We��ll have time later,�� shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and 
handing one to Harry. ��Hermione, cop hold (take hold of, look at), let��s grab a table... Not there! 
Nowhere near Muriel �C��

 Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went; Harry felt sure 
that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the 
marquee, most of the tables were occupied, The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone.

 ��All right if we join you?�� asked Ron. 

 ��Oh yes,�� she said happily. ��Daddy��s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.��

 ��What is it, a lifetime��s supply of Gurdyroots?�� asked Ron. 

Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, 
Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. 

The band had begun to play, Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after 
a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur��s 
father.

��I like this song,�� said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she 
stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed 
and waving her arms.

 ��She��s great, isn��t she?�� said Ron admiringly. ��Always good value.��

 But the smile vanished from his face at once, Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna��s vacant seat. 
Hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With 
a scowl on his face he said, ��Who is that man in the yellow?�� 

��That��s Xenophilius Lovegood, he��s the father of a friend of ours,�� said Ron. His pugnacious 
tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. 
��Come and dance,�� he added abruptly to Hermione. 

She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into the growing 

throng on the dance floor. 

 ��Ah, they are together now?�� asked Krum, momentarily distracted.

 ��Er �C sort of,�� said Harry.

 ��Who are you?�� Krum asked. 

 ��Barny Weasley.��

 They shook hands. 

 ��You, Barny �C you know this man Lovegood well?��

 ��No, I only met him today. Why?�� 

Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several 
warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. 

��Because,�� said Krum, ��If he vus not a guest of Fleur��s I vould duel him, here and now, for 
veering that filthy sign upon his chest.�� 

��Sign?�� said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye was gleaming 
on his chest. ��Why? What��s wrong with it?��

 ��Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald��s sign.��

 ��Grindelwald... the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?��

 ��Exactly.�� 

Krum��s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, ��Grindelvald killed many 

people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never powerful in this country, they said he

feared Dumbledore �C and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this�� �C he pointed a finger at 
Xenophilius �C ��this is his symbol, I recognized it at vunce, Grindelvald carved it into a vall at 
Durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to 
shock, make themselves impressive �C until those of us who had lost family members to 
Grindelvald taught them better.�� 

Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It 
seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna��s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in 
the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, fin-like shape. 

 ��Are you �C er �C quite sure it��s Grindelwald��s -?�� 

��I am not mistaken,�� said Krum coldly. ��I walked past that sign for several years, I know it 
vell.�� 

��Well, there��s a chance,�� said Harry, ��that Xenophilius doesn��t actually know what the symbol 
means, the Lovegoods are quite... unusual. He could have easily picked it up somewhere and think 
it��s a cross section����� of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something.��

 ��The cross section of a vot?��

 ��Well, I don��t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for 
them.��

 Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father. 

��That��s her,�� he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her arms around 

her head like someone attempting to beat off midges��. 

 ��Vy is she doing that?�� asked Krum.

 ��Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,�� said Harry, who recognized the symptoms. 

Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He drew his wand 

from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs; sparks flew out of the end. 

��Gregorovitch!�� said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care; the 
memory had come back to him at the sight of Krum��s wand, Ollivander taking it and examining it 
carefully before the Triwizard Tournament.

 ��Vot about him?�� asked Krum suspiciously.

 ��He��s a wandmaker!��

 ��I know that,�� said Krum.

��107ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He made your wand! That��s why I thought �C Quidditch �C��

 Krum was looking more and more suspicious.

 ��How do you know Gregorovitch made my wand?�� 

��I... I read it somewhere, I think,�� said Harry. ��In a �C a fan magazine,�� he improvised wildly 
and Krum looked mollified.

 ��I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,�� he said.

 ��So... er... where is Gregorowitch these days?�� 

Krum looked puzzled. ��He retired several years ago. I was one of the last to purchase a 
Gregorovitch vand. They are the best �Calthough I know, of course, that your Britons set much store 
by Ollivander.�� 

Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. 
So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and Harry did not have to search far for a 
reason. It was surely because of what Harry�� wand had done on the night that Voldemort pursued 
him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, some 
thing that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would Gregorowitch know better? Was he 
truly more skilled than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not? 

��This girl is very nice-looking,�� Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings. Krum was 
pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. ��She is also a relative of yours?�� 

��Yeah,�� said Harry, suddenly irritated, ��and she��s seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. 
You wouldn��t want to cross him.�� 

Krum grunted. 

��Vot,�� he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, ��is the point of being an 
international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?�� 

And he strode off leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way 
around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about 
Gregorovitch, but he was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. Harry leaned up 
against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and 
George��s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron. 

He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations 
differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding

cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of 
champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As the evening drew in, and moths began 
to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and 
more uncontained. Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of 
Fleur��s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing ��Odo the 
Hero�� in the corner. 

Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron��s who seemed unsure 
whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of 

white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock 


and was topped by a moth-

eaten fez������ձñ . He was vaguely familiar. Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that 
this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore��s 
obituary.

 Harry approached him.

 ��May I sit down?��

 ��Of course, of course,�� said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice.

 Harry leaned in. ��Mr. Doge, I��m Harry Potter.�� 

Doge gasped. ��My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. I am so glad, so 
honored!��

 In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne. ��I thought of writing 
to you,�� he whispered, ��after Dumbledore... the shock... and for you, I am sure...�� Doge��s tiny eyes 
filled with sudden tears. 

��I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,�� said Harry. ��I didn��t realize you knew 
Professor Dumbledore so well.��

 ��As well as anyone,�� said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. ��Certainly I knew him longest, 
if you don��t count Aberforth �C and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.��

 ��Speaking of the Daily Prophet... I don��t know whether you saw, Mr. Doge -?��

 ��Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.��

 ��Elphias, I don��t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?�� 

Doge��s face flooded with angry color. ��Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might

be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her, I am ashamed to say that I became 
rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you my have seen, in aspersions cast 
upon my sanity.�� 

��Well, in that interview,�� Harry went on, ��Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was 
involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.�� 

��Don��t believe a word of it!�� said Doge at once. ��Not a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your 
memories of Albus Dumbledore!�� 

Harry looked into Doge��s earnest, pained face, and felt, not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge 
really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn��t Doge 
understand Harry��s need to be sure, to know everything?�� 

Perhaps Doge suspected Harry��s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, ��Harry, Rita 

Skeeter is a dreadful �C��

 But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.

 ��Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!�� 

Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hair, 

a goblet of champagne in her hand. ��She��s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!�� 

��Hello, Muriel,�� said Doge, ��Yes, we were just discussing �C��

 ��You there! Give me your chair, I��m a hundred and seven!�� 

Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel 
swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and 
Harry. 

��Hello again, Barry or whatever your name is,�� she said to Harry, ��Now what were you saying 
about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know, she��s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can��t wait to 
read it. I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!�� 

Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony 
fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. 

She took another large gulp of champagne, belched and then said, ��There��s no need to look like 
a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh (nonesense, 
rubbish), there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!��

 ��Ill-informed sniping�̰�����,�� said Doge, turning radish-colored again.

��110ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��You would say that, Elphias,�� cackled Auntie Muriel. ��I noticed how you skated over�ӹ� ;��
�� the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!�� 

��I��m sorry you think so,�� said Doge, more coldly still. ��I assure you I was writing from the 
heart.�� 

��Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you��ll still think he was a saint even 
if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!��

 ��Muriel!�� exclaimed Doge. 

 A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry��s chest. 

��What do you mean?�� he asked Muriel. ��Who said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was 

ill?�� 

��Thought wrong, then, didn��t you, Barry!�� said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted at the effect 
she had produced. ��Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it? It all happened 
years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who 
were alive then never knew what really happened. That��s why I can��t wait to find out what 
Skeeter��s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!��

 ��Untrue!�� wheezed Doge, ��Absolutely untrue!��

 ��He never told me his sister was a Squib,�� said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside. 

��And why on earth would he tell you?�� screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she 
attempted to focus upon Harry. 

��The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,�� began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, ��is, 
I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death �C�� 

��Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?�� squawked Muriel, ��Why did half of us never even 
know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where 
was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never 
mind what was going on in his own house!��

 ��What d��you mean, locked in the cellar?�� asked Harry. ��What is this?��

 Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry. 

��Dumbledore��s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard 
she pretended otherwise.�� 

��She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,�� whispered Doge

miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him. 

��-proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a 
Squib-��

 ��Ariana was not a Squib!�� wheezed Doge. 

��So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!�� said Auntie Muriel. 
She turned back to Harry. ��In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, though to take it to the 
extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn��t exist �C�� 

��I tell you, that��s not what happened!�� said Doge, but Auntie Muriel steamrollered on, still 
addressing Harry. 

��Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the 
Muggle community... much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where 
they must always be second class, but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn��t have dreamed of 
letting her daughter go to a Muggle school �C��

 ��Ariana was delicate!�� said Doge desperately. ��Her health was always too poor to permit her �C�� 

��-to permit her to leave the house?�� cackled Muriel. ��And yet she was never taken to St. 
Mungo��s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!��

 ��Really, Muriel, how can you possibly know whether ...�� 

��For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo��s at the time, 

and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All most 

suspicious, Lancelot thought!�� 

Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. 

Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more 
champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, 
kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore��s sister suffered the 
same fate in reverse, imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to her 
fate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented? 

��Now, if Kendra hadn��t died first,�� Muriel resumed, ��I��d have said that it was she who finished 
off Ariana �C�� 

��How can you, Muriel!�� groaned Doge. ��A mother kill her own daughter? Think what you��re 
saying!��

��112ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end, why not?�� 
shrugged Auntie Muriel. ��But as I say, it doesn��t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana �C of what, 
nobody ever seemed sure. 

��Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,�� 
said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. ��Shake your head all you like, Elphias. You were at Ariana��s 
funeral, were you not?�� 

��Yes I was,�� said Doge, through trembling lips, ��and a more desperately sad occasion I cannot 
remember. Albus was heartbroken-�� 

��His heart wasn��t the only thing. Didn��t Aberforth break Albus�� nose halfway through the 
service?�� 

If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might 
have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down 
her chin. 

 ��How do you -?�� croaked Doge. 

��My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,�� said Auntie Muriel happily. ��Bathilda 
described the whole thing to mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl. The 
way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus�� fault that Ariana was dead and then 
punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that��s odd 
enough in itself. Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his 
back. 

Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her 
as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe. He wanted the 
truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could 
hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside 
his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story. 

��And I��ll tell you something else,�� Muriel said, hiccupping slightly as she lowered her goblet. 
��I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter��s interview about 
an important source close to the Dumbledores �C goodness knows she was there all through the 
Ariana business, and it would fit!��

 ��Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!�� whispered Doge. 

��113ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Bathilda Bagshot?�� Harry said. ��The author of A History of Magic?�� 

The name was printed on the front of one of Harry��s textbooks, though admittedly not one of 
the ones he had read more attentively. 

��Yes,�� said Doge, clutching at Harry��s question like a drowning man at a life heir. ��A most 
gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus��s.��

 ��Quite gaga these days, I��ve heard,�� said Auntie Muriel cheerfully. 

��If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her,�� said 

Doge, ��and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!�� 

��Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I��m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,�� 
said Auntie Muriel ��But even if Bathilda��s completely cuckoo, I��m sure she��d still have old 
photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. Well worth a trip to 
Godric��s Hollow, I��d have thought.�� 

Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the back as Harry 
coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, 
he asked, ��Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric��s Hollow?�� 

��Oh yes, she��s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was 

imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.��

 ��The Dumbledores lived in Godric��s Hollows?��

 ��Yes, Barry, that��s what I just said,�� said Auntie Muriel testily. 

Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had 
both lived and lost loved ones in Godric��s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and James buried close to 
Dumbledore��s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, perhaps walked past Lily��s 
and James��s to do so? And he had never once told Harry ... never bothered to say... 

And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt it had been 
tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common. He 
stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and did not realize that 
Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him. 

��I simply can��t dance anymore,�� she panted, slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole 
of her foot. ��Ron��s gone looking to find more butterbeers. It��s a bit odd. I��ve just seen Viktor 
storming away from Luna��s father, it looked like they��d been arguing �C�� She dropped her voice,

staring at him. ��Harry, are you okay?�� 

Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter, at that moment, something large and 
silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynxɽè
��� landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as those nearest it froze 
absurdly in mid-dance. Then the Patronus��s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, 
slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt.

Chapter Nine 

A Place to Hide 

Everything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and 


Hermione jumped 
to their feet and drew their wands. Many people 

were only just 
realizing that something strange had happened; 

heads were still 
turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. 

Silence spread 
outward in cold ripples from the place where the 

Patronus had 
landed. Then somebody screamed. 
Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests were sprinting in all 

directions; many were Disapparating; the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken. 

 ��Ron!�� Hermione cried. ��Ron, where are you?�� 

As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw cloaked and masked figures 
appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them 
shout, ��Protego!��, a cry that was echoed on all sides �C 

��Ron! Ron!�� Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffeted by terrified guests, 
Harry seized her hand to make sure they weren��t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their 
heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know �C 

And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione��s free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the 
spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was 
Hermione��s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from 
the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself... 

 ��Where are we?�� said Ron��s voice. 

Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all; they 
still seemed to be surrounded by people. 

��Tottenham Court Road,�� panted Hermione. ��Walk, just walk, we need to find somewhere for 
you to change.�� 

Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street thronged with late-
night revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus 
rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still

��116ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

wearing dress robes. 

��Hermione, we haven��t got anything to change into,�� Ron told her, as a young woman burst 
into raucous giggles at the sight of him.

 ��Why didn��t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?�� said Harry, inwardly cursing his 
own stupidity. ��All last year I kept it on me and �C��

 ��It��s okay, I��ve got the Cloak, I��ve got clothes for both of you,�� said Hermione, ��Just try and act 
naturally until �C this will do.��

 She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway. 

��When you say you��ve got the Cloak, and clothes ...�� said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who 
was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging. 

��Yes, they��re here,�� said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron��s utter astonishment, she pulled out a 
pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.

 ��How the ruddy hell �C?�� 

��Undetectable Extension Charm,�� said Hermione. ��Tricky, but I think I��ve done it okay; 
anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.�� She gave the fragile-looking bag a little 
shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. ��Oh, 
damn, that��ll be the books,�� she said, peering into it, ��and I had them all stacked by subject. Oh 
well... Harry, you��d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change.��

 ��When did you do all this?�� Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes. 

��I told you at the Burrow, I��ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed 
to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and put 
it in here... I just had a feeling... ��

 ��You��re amazing, you are,�� said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes. 

��Thank you,�� said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag. 
��Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!�� 

Harry threw his Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head, 
vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened.

 ��The others �C everybody at the wedding �C��

 ��We can��t worry about that now,�� whispered Hermione. ��It��s you they��re after, Harry, and we��ll 

just put everyone in even more danger by going back.��

��117ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��She��s right,�� said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even if he could 
not see his face. ��Most of the Order was there, they��ll look after everyone.�� 

Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, ��Yeah.�� But he thought 
of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.

 ��Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,�� said Hermione. 

They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group of men on the 

opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement.

 ��Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?�� Ron asked Hermione. 

��I��ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I��m sure we��re safer out in the Muggle world, 

it��s not where they��ll expect us to be.��

 ��True,�� said Ron, looking around, ��but don��t you feel a bit �C exposed?��

 ��Where else is there?�� asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other side of the road started 
wolf-whistling at her. ��We can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And 
Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there... I suppose we could try my parents�� home, 
though I think there��s a chance they might check there... Oh, I wish they��d shut up!�� 

��All right, darling?�� the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. ��Fancy a 
drink? Ditch ginger (reddish brown color) and come and have a pint!�� 

��Let��s sit down somewhere,�� Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to shout back 
across the road. ��Look, this will do, in here!�� 

It was a small and shabby all-night caf��. A light layer of grease lay on all the Formica-topped 
tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite 
Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it, she glanced over her shoulder so 
frequently she appeared to have a twitch�鴤 . Harry did not like being stationary; walking had 
given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of 
Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses 
out of his pocket and put them on again. 

After a minute or two, Ron said, ��You know, we��re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it��s 

only in Charing Cross �C��

 ��Ron, we can��t!�� said Hermione at once.

 ��Not to stay there, but to find out what��s going on!��

��118ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We know what��s going on! Voldemort��s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to 
know?��

 ��Okay, okay, it was just an idea!�� They relapsed into a prickly silence. 

The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos, As Harry 
was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the 
caf�� and squeezed into the next booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper. 

��I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. Once we��re there, we 

could send a message to the Order.��

 ��Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?�� asked Ron. 

 ��I��ve been practicing and I think so,�� said Hermione. 

��Well, as long as it doesn��t get them into trouble, though they might��ve been arrested already. 
God, that��s revolting,�� Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had 
heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers�� orders. The larger 
of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved 
her away. She stared, affronted. 

��Let��s get going, then, I don��t want to drink this muck,�� said Ron. ��Hermione, have you got 
Muggle money to pay for this?�� 

��Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. I��ll bet all the 
change is at the bottom,�� sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag. 

The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious 
thought, all three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going 
on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench. The force of the Death 
Eaters�� spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron��s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, 
yelled, ��Stupefy!�� 

The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light, He slumped sideways, 
unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron, Shining 
black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot �C the waitress screamed and ran 
for the door �C Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had 
tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in 
front of the door.

��Expulso!�� bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up. 
The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the 
Cloak slipped off him. 

��Petrificus Totalus!�� screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater fell forward 
like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. 
Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and 
trembling all over. 

��D-diffindo,�� she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she slashed open the 
knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. ��Oh, I��m so sorry, Ron, my hand��s shaking! Diffindo!�� 

The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. 
Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was 
sprawled across the bench. 

��I should��ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,�� he said. He turned over 
the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man��s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron and 
Hermione. 

��That��s Dolohov,�� said Ron. ��I recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one��s 
Thorfinn Rowle.�� 

��Never mind what they��re called!�� said Hermione a little hysterically. ��How did they find us? 
What are we going to do?��

 Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry��s head.

 ��Lock the door,�� he told her, ��and Ron, turn out the lights.�� 

He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the 
Deluminator to plunge the caf�� into darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at 
Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance. 

��What are we going to do with them?�� Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; then, even 
more quietly, ��Kill them? They��d kill us. They had a good go just now.��

 Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head. 

��We just need to wipe their memories,�� said Harry. ��It��s better like that, it��ll throw them off the 
scent. If we killed them it��d be obvious we were here.�� 

��You��re the boss,�� said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. ��But I��ve never done a Memory

Charm.��

 ��Nor have I,�� said Hermione, ��but I know the theory.�� 

She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov��s forehead and said, 

��Obliviate.��

 At once, Dolohov��s eyes became unfocused and dreamy. 

��Brilliant!�� said Harry, clapping her on the back. ��Take care of the other one and the waitress 

while Ron and I clear up.�� 

��Clear up?�� said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed caf��. ��Why?�� 

��Don��t you think they might wonder what��s happened if they wake up and find themselves in a 

place that looks like it��s just been bombed?��

 ��Oh right, yeah ...��

 Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket.

 ��It��s no wonder I can��t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they��re tight.�� 

��Oh, I��m so sorry,�� hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the 
windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead. 

Once the caf�� was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters back into 
their booth and propped them up facing each other. ��But how did they find us?�� Hermione asked, 
looking from one inert man to the other. ��How did they know where we were?��

 She turned to Harry.

 ��You �C you don��t think you��ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?�� 

��He can��t have,�� said Ron. ��The Trace breaks at seventeen, that��s Wizarding law, you can��t put 
it on an adult.��

 ��As far as you know,�� said Hermione. ��What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a 
seventeen-year-old?�� 

��But Harry hasn��t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who��s supposed to 
have put a Trace back on him?�� 

Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted. Was that really how the Death Eaters 
had found them? 

��If I can��t use magic, and you can��t use magic near me, without us giving away our position �C �� 
he began. 

��121ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We��re not splitting up!�� said Hermione firmly.

 ��We need a safe place to hide,�� said Ron. ��Give us time to think things through.��

 ��Grimmauld Place,�� said Harry.

 The other two gaped.

 ��Don��t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!�� 

��Ron��s dad said they��ve put up jinxes against him �C and even if they haven��t worked,�� he 
pressed on as Hermione began to argue ��so what? I swear, I��d like nothing better than to meet 

Snape!��

 ��But �C�� 

��Hermione, where else is there? It��s the best chance we��ve got. Snape��s only one Death Eater. 

If I��ve still got the Trace on me, we��ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.�� 

She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she unlocked the 
caf�� door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the caf����s light. Then, on Harry��s count of three, 
they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death 
Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned on the spot and 
vanished into the compressing darkness once more. 

Seconds later Harry��s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes. They were now 
standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down 
on them from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had been told of its 
existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking every few yards 
that they were not being followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the 
front door once with his wand. They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then 
the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold. 

As Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas lamps sprang into life, casting 
flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it, eerie, 
cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. 
Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of Sirius��s mother. The only thing that was out of place 
was the troll��s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over 
again.

 ��I think somebody��s been in here,�� Hermione whispered, pointing toward it.

��122ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��That could��ve happened as the Order left,�� Ron murmured back.

 ��So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?�� Harry asked.

 ��Maybe they��re only activated if he shows up?�� suggested Ron. 

Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared to move farther 
into the house. 

 ��Well, we can��t stay here forever,�� said Harry, and he took a step forward. 

��Severus Snape?�� 

Mad-Eye Moody��s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them jump back in 

fright. 

��We��re not Snape!�� croaked Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his 
tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak. Before he had time to feel inside 
his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. 

The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron was making 
retching noises; Hermione stammered, ��That m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse 
Mad-Eye set up for Snape!�� 

Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the 
hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, 
dust-colored, and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, her curtains flying open; the 
gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming 
behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets, horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it 
raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry. 

��No!�� Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. ��No! It 
wasn��t us! We didn��t kill you �C�� 

On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust, Coughing, his eyes watering, 
Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her 
head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and 
saying, ��It��s all r-right... It��s g-gone... �� 

Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black continued to 
scream.

 ��Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers �C��

��123ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��SHUT UP!�� Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red 
sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her. 

 ��That ... that was ...�� Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. 

��Yeah,�� said Harry, ��but it wasn��t really him, was it? Just something to scare Snape.�� 

Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure aside as casually 
as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-
expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along 
the skirting board���ڰ�, �Ű�=baseboard. 

��Before we go any farther, I think we��d better check,�� whispered Hermione, and she raised her 

wand and said, ��Homenum revelio.��

 Nothing happened. 

 ��Well, you��ve just had a big shock,�� said Ron kindly. ��What was that supposed to do?�� 

��It did what I meant it to do!�� said Hermione rather crossly. ��That was a spell to reveal human 
presence, and there��s nobody here except us!�� 

��And old Dusty,�� said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-figure had 
risen. 

��Let��s go up,�� said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led the way up 
the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. 

Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drafty 
room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window 
and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch. 

��Can��t see anyone out there,�� he reported. ��And you��d think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, 
they��d have followed us here. I know they can��t get in the house, but �C what��s up, Harry?�� 

Harry had given a cry of pain. His scar had burned again as something flashed across his mind 
like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound 
through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock. 

 ��What did you see?�� Ron asked, advancing on Harry. ��Did you see him at my place?��

 ��No, I just felt anger �C he��s really angry �C�� 

��But that could be at the Burrow,�� said Ron loudly. ��What else? Didn��t you see anything? Was 
he cursing someone?��

��124ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No, I just felt anger �C I couldn��t tell �C�� 

Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice, 
��Your scar, again? But what��s going on? I thought that connection had closed!�� 

��It did, for a while,�� muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard to 
concentrate. ��I �C I think it��s started opening again whenever he loses control, that��s how it used to 
�C�� 

��But then you��ve got to close your mind!�� said Hermione shrilly. ��Harry, Dumbledore didn��t 
want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that��s why you were supposed to 
use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember �C�� 

��Yeah, I do remember, thanks,�� said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to 
tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame (identical, exactly the same) connection 
between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius��s death. He wished that he 
had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he 
were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he 
fought it. It was like resisting the urge to be sick. 

He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black 
family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked, Harry drew his wand again and spun around to 
see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of 
them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron��s father.

 ��Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.�� 

The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan 
and dropped onto the sofa, Hermione joined him, gripping his arm.

 ��They��re all right, they��re all right!�� she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her. 

 ��Harry,�� he said over Hermione��s shoulder, ��I �C�� 

��It��s not a problem,�� said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. ��It��s your family, 'course you 

were worried. I��d feel the same way.�� He thought of Ginny. ��I do feel the same way.�� 

The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had back in the garden of the Burrow. 
Faintly he heard Hermione say ��I don��t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags 
I��ve brought and camp in here tonight?��

 He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer. He had to succumb.

��125ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Bathroom,�� he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running. 

He barely made it. Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding 
head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him 
possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the giant blond Death Eater on the floor, 
screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry 
spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice. 

��More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he 
will forgive this time... You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? 
Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure... Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!�� 

A log fell in the fire, flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face �C 
with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes. 

He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches from one of the silver 
serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy��s gaunt, petrified face seemed 
burned on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which 
Draco was now being put by Voldemort.

 There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione��s voice rang out.

 ��Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I��ve got it here.��

 ��Yeah, great, thanks,�� he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in.

Chapter Ten 
Kreacher��s Tale 


Harry woke early next morning, 


wrapped 
in a sleeping bag on the drawing room 

floor. A 
chink of sky was visible between the 

heavy 
curtains. It was the cool, clear blue of 

watered 
ink, somewhere between night and 

dawn, 
and everything was quiet except for Ron 

and 
Hermione��s slow, deep breathing. Harry 

glanced 
over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and 
insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above 
his. Her arm curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron��s. Harry wondered whether they had 
fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely. 

He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than twenty-four house 
ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in 
wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen now? He lay on the floor 
and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting (intimidating, awesome) complex mission 
Dumbledore had left him... Dumbledore... 

The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore��s death felt different now. The accusations 
he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things, 
infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could Dumbledore have let such things 
happen? Had he been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect 
him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden? 

Harry thought of Godric��s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never mentioned there; he 
thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledore��s will, and resentment 
swelled in the darkness. Why hadn��t Dumbledore told him? Why hadn��t he explained? Had 
Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be 
polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in?

��127ҳ��

Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for 
something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping bad, picked up his wand, and crept 
out of the room. On the landing he whispered, ��Lumos,�� and started to climb the stairs by 
wandlight. 

On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time they had been 
here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes������Ʒ had been 
ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the 
house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this 
house both before and after Sirius died? Harry��s gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes 
contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius��s great-great grandfather, but it was empty, showing 
nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the 
headmaster��s study at Hogwarts. 

Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two 
doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading Sirius. Harry had never entered his 
godfather��s bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his wand high to cast light as 
widely as possible. The room was spacious and must once have been handsome. There was a large 
bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a 
chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle scrubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging in 
frostlike drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed��s headboard; a 
spiders web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as 
Harry moved deeper into the room, he head a scurrying of disturbed mice. 

The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the 
wall��s silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Sirius��s parents had been unable 
to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall because he was sure they 
would not have appreciated their eldest son��s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have long gone 
out of his way to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and 
gold just to underline his difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many 
pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius��s nerve) several posters of 
bikini-clad Muggle girls. Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite

��128ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in 
contrast to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four Hogwarts 
students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera. 

With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father, his untidy black hair stuck up at the back 
like Harry��s, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly 
arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius��s right 
stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his 
inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. 
On James��s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted 
surprise at finding himself liked and included or was it simply because Harry knew how it had 
been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after 
all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in 
preventing his parents from redecorating his room. 

Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brightest. A shaft of light 
revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius��s 
bedroom had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly, if not 
entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with the 
covers and sundry���ֵ� pages littered the floor. 

Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined them. He recognized 
one as a part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as 
belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten and crumpled. He 
smoothed it out. 

Dear Padfoot,

 Thank you, thank you, for Harry��s birthday present! It was his favorite by far. One year old and 
already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself. I��m enclosing a 
picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground but he nearly killed the 
cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of 
course James thought it was so funny, says he��s going to be a great Quidditch player but we��ve 
had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don��t take our eyes off him when he gets

��129ҳ��

going. 

We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda who has always been sweet to us and 
who dotes�簮 on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn��t come, but the Order��s got to come first, 
and Harry��s not old enough to know it��s his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut 
up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell �C also Dumbledore��s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so 
no chance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy was here 
last weekend. I thought he seemed down, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; I 
cried all evening when I heard. 

Bathilda drops in most days, she��s a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about 
Dumbledore. I��m not sure he��d be pleased if he knew! I don��t know how much to believe, actually 
because it seems incredible that Dumbledore 

Harry��s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite still, holding the miraculous 
paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent joy and grief 
thundering its equal measure through his veins. Lurching to the bed, he sat down. 

He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time, 
and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. She had made her ��g��s the same way he did. 
He searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt like a friendly little wave 
glimpsed from behind a veil. The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, 
really lived, that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment, tracing ink into these 
letters, these words, words about him, Harry, her son. 

Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time concentrating 
on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered voice.

 They had a cat... perhaps it had perished, like his parents at Godric��s Hollow... or else fled when 
there was nobody left to feed it... Sirius had bought him his first broomstick... His parents had 
known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced them? Dumbledore��s still got his Invisibility 
Cloak... there was something funny there... 

Harry paused, pondering his mother��s words. Why had Dumbledore taken James��s Invisibility 
Cloak? Harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before, ��I don��t need a cloak 
to become invisible��. Perhaps some less gifted Order member had needed its assistance, and 
Dumbledore had acted as a carrier? Harry passed on... 

��130ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Wormy was here... Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed ��down�� had he? Was he aware that he was 
seeing James and Lily alive for the last time? 

And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dumbledore. It seems incredible 
that Dumbledore 


That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would seem incredible about 
Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test, for instance or had 
taken up goat charming like Aberforth... 

Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor, Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere. 
He seized papers, treating them in his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original 
searcher, he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of 
the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair. 

At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the 
chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph that Lily had 
described in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, 
roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing after him. 
Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily��s letter and continued to look for the second 
sheet. 

After another quarter of an hour, however he was forced to conclude that the rest of his 
mother��s letter was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had 
been written, or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room? Harry read the first sheet 
again, this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His toy 
broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters... The only potentially useful 
thing he could see her was possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that 
Dumbledore �C what? 

��Harry? Harry? Harry!�� 

��I��m here!�� he called, ��What��s happened?�� 

There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst inside. 

��We woke up and didn��t know where you were!�� she said breathlessly. She turned and shouted 
over her shoulder, ��Ron! I��ve found him�� 

Ron��s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below.

��131ҳ��

��Good! Tell him from me he��s a git!�� 

��Harry, don��t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did you come up here anyway?�� 
She gazed around the ransacked room. ��What have you been doing?�� 

��Look what I��ve just found.�� 

He held out his mother��s letter. Hermione took it out and read it while Harry watched her. When 

she reached the end of the page she looked up at him. 

��Oh Harry...�� 

��And there��s this too.�� 

He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of 

sight on the toy broom. 

��I��ve been looking for the rest of the letter,�� Harry said, ��but it��s not here.�� 

Hermione glanced around. 

��Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?�� 

��Someone had searched before me,�� said Harry. 

��I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. What were they after, 

do you think?�� 

��Information on the Order, if it was Snape.�� 

��But you��d think he��d already have all he needed. I mean he was in the Order, wasn��t he?�� 

��Well then,�� said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, ��what about information on Dumbledore? 

The second page of the letter, for instance. You know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know 

who she is?�� 

��Who?�� 

��Bathilda Bagshot, the author of �C�� 

��A History of Magic,�� said Hermione, looking interested. ��So your parents knew her? She was 

an incredible magic historian.�� 

��And she��s still alive,�� said Harry, ��and she lives in Godric��s Hollow. Ron��s Auntie Muriel was 
talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore��s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk 
to, wouldn��t she?�� 

There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him for Harry��s liking. 
He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so

��132ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

as not to have to look at her and give himself away. 

��I understand why you��d love to talk to her about your mum and dad, and Dumbledore too,�� 
said Hermione. ��But that wouldn��t really help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?�� 

Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, ��Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric��s 
Hollow, but I��m scared. I��m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just 
makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I��m 
sure they��d be expecting you to visit it.�� 

��It��s not just that,�� Harry said, still avoiding looking at her, ��Muriel said stuff about 
Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth...�� 

He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he had finished, Hermione said, 
��Of course, I can see why that��s upset you, Harry �C��

 ��I��m not upset,�� he lied, ��I��d just like to know whether or not it��s true or �C�� 

��Harry do you really think you��ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from 

Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dumbledore!��

 ��I thought I did,�� he muttered. 

��But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, 
how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?�� 

He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it was again, choose what to 
believe. He wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined that he should not get it? 

��Shall we go down to the kitchen?�� Hermione suggested after a little pause. ��Find something 
for breakfast?�� 

He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing and past the second door that 
led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not 
noticed in the dark. He passed at the top of the stairs to read it. It was a pompous little sign, neatly 
lettered by hand, the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door. 

Do Not Enter 
Without the Express Permission of 
Regulus Arcturus Black


��133ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Excitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately sure why. He read the sign 

again. Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him.

 ��Hermione,�� he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm. ��Come back up here.��

 ��What��s the matter?��

 ��R.A.B. I think I��ve found him.��

 There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs. 

 ��In your mum��s letter? But I didn��t see �C��

 Harry shook his head, pointing at Regulus��s sign. 

She read it, then clutched Harry��s arm so tightly that he winced. 

 ��Sirius��s brother?�� she whispered. 

 ��He was a Death Eater,�� said Harry. ��Sirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really 
young and then got cold feet and tried to leave �C so they killed him.�� 

��That fits!�� gasped Hermione. ��If he was a Death Eater he had access to Voldemort, and if he 

became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down!��

 She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, ��Ron! RON! Get up here, quick!��

 Ron appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his hand. 

 ��What��s up? If it��s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I �C��

 He frowned at the sign on Regulus��s door, in which Hermione was silently pointing. 

��What? That was Sirius��s brother, wasn��t it? Regulus Arcturus ... Regulus ... R.A.B.! The locket 

�C you don��t reckon - ?�� 
��Let��s find out,�� said Harry. He pushed the door. It was locked. Hermione pointed her wand at 
the handle and said, ��Alohamora.�� There was a click, and the door swung open. 
They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus��s bedroom was slightly 
smaller than Sirius��s, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought 
to advertise his diffidence from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the 
opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, 
and the windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its 
motto, TOUJOURS PUR. Beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck 
together to make a ragged collage����������. Hermione crossed the room to examine them. 

��They��re all about Voldemort,�� she said. ��Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years

��134ҳ��

before he joined the Death Eaters ...�� 

A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. Harry, 
meanwhile, had noticed another photograph, a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving 
out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests, Slytherins. 
Regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row, He had the 
same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, slighter, and rather 
less handsome than Sirius had been. 

 ��He played Seeker,�� said Harry. 

��What?�� said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort��s press clippings. 

��He��s sitting in the middle of the front row, that��s where the Seeker ... Never mind,�� said Harry, 
realizing that nobody was listening. Ron was on his hands and knees, searching under the 
wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk. Yet 
again, somebody had searched before them. The drawers�� contents had been turned over recently, 
the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there, old quills, out-of-date textbooks that bore 
evidence of being roughly handled, a recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the 
contents of the drawer. 

��There��s an easier way,�� said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans. She 
raised her wand and said, ��Accio Locket!�� 

Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, looked 
disappointed.

 ��Is that it, then? It��s not here?�� 

��Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,�� said Hermione. ��Charms to 
prevent it from being summoned magically, you know.�� 

��Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,�� said Harry, remembering how he had been 
unable to Summon the fake locket.

 ��How are we supposed to find it then?�� asked Ron. 

 ��We search manually,�� said Hermione. 

��That��s a good idea,�� said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his examination of the 
curtains. 

They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were forced, finally, to

��135ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

conclude that the locket was not there.

 The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows. 

��It could be somewhere else in the house, though,�� said Hermione in a rallying tone as they 
walked back downstairs. As Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, she seemed to have 
become more determined. ��Whether he��d manage to destroy it or not, he��d want to keep it hidden 
from Voldemort, wouldn��t he? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we 
were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle 
Ron; Regulus might have put them there to protect the locket��s hiding place, even though we 
didn��t realize it at ... at ... �� 

Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in midair, with the dumbstruck 

look of one who had just been Obliviated, her eyes had even drifted out of focus. 

 ��... at the time,�� she finished in a whisper. 

 ��Something wrong?�� asked Ron. 

 ��There was a locket.��

 ��What?�� said Harry and Ron together.

 ��In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we ... we ... �� 

Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach. He remembered. 
He had even handled the thing as they passed it around, each trying in turn to pry it open. It had 
been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box 
that had made everyone sleepy ...�� 

��Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,�� said Harry. It was the only chance, the only 
slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go. ��He had a whole 
stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C��mon.�� 

He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along in his wake. 
They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Sirius��s mother as they passed through the 
hall. 

��Filth! Mudbloods! Scum!�� she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement 
kitchen and slammed the door behind them. Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at 
the door of Kreacher��s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the nest of dirty old blankets in 
which the house-elf had once slept, but they were not longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher

��136ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy of Nature��s Nobility, A Wizarding Genealogy. 
Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell 
out and rolled dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; 
Hermione closed her eyes.

 ��It��s not over yet,�� said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, ��Kreacher!�� 

There was a loud crack and the house elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius 
appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace, tiny, half human-sized, his pale 
skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears. He was still 
wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him, and the contemptuous look he bent upon 
Harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit. 

��Master,�� croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog��s voice, and he bowed low; muttering to his knees, 
��back in my Mistress��s old house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood �C�� 

��I forbid you to call anyone 'blood traitor' or 'Mudblood,'�� growled Harry. He would have 
found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctively unlovable object even 
if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort. 

��I��ve got a question for you,�� said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the 
elf, ��and I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand?�� 

��Yes, Master,�� said Kreacher, bowing low again. Harry saw his lips moving soundlessly, 
undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter. 

��Two years ago,�� said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs, ��there was a big gold 
locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back?�� 

There was a moment��s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the 
face. Then he said, ��Yes.��

 ��Where is it now?�� asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful.

 Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word. 

 ��Gone.��

 ��Gone?�� echoed Harry, elation floating out of him, ��What do you mean, it��s gone?��

 The elf shivered. He swayed.

 ��Kreacher,�� said Harry fiercely, ��I order you �C�� 

��Mundungus Fletcher,�� croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. ��Mundungus Fletcher stole it

��137ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

all; Miss Bella��s and Miss Cissy��s pictures, my Mistress��s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, 
the goblets with the family crest, and �C and �C �� 

Kreacher was gulping for air, His hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly, then his eyes flew 
open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream.

 ��- and the locket, Master Regulus��s locket. Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!�� 

Harry reacted instinctively, as Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, he launched 
himself upon the elf, flattening him. Hermione��s scream mingled with Kreacher��s but Harry 
bellowed louder than both of them, ��Kreacher, I order you to stay still!�� 

He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing 
from his sagging eyes.

 ��Harry, let him up!�� Hermione whispered. 

��So he can beat himself up with the poker?�� snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf. ��I don��t 
think so. Right. Kreacher, I want the truth. How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the 
locket?�� 

��Kreacher saw him!�� gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of 
graying teeth. ��Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher��s cupboard with his hands full of 
Kreacher��s treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r-
ran ... �� 

��You called the locket 'Master Regulus��s,'�� said Harry. ��Why? Where did it come from? What 
did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, 
and everything Regulus had to do with it!�� 

The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees, and began to rock 
backward and forward. When he spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, 
echoing kitchen. 

��Master Sirius ran away, good riddance��ϲ�İ��� , for he was a bad boy and broke my 
Mistress��s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper order; he knew what was 
due (suitable) to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the 
Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggleborns 
... and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so 
proud, so happy to serve.

��138ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��And one day, a year after he joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see 

Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said ... he said ...��

 The old elf rocked faster than ever.

 ��... he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.�� 

��Voldemort needed an elf?�� Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked 

just as puzzled as he did. 

��Oh yes,�� moaned Kreacher. ��And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, 
said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the 
Dark Lord ordered him to do ... and then to c-come home.��

 Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs. 

 ��So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, 
but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave was a cavern, and in the 
cavern was a great black lake...�� 

The hairs on the back of Harry��s neck stood up. Kreacher��s croaking voice seemed to come to 
him from across the dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been 
present.

 ��... There was a boat ...�� 

Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as 
to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. This, then, was how Voldemort 
had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux, by borrowing a disposable creature, a house-elf...

 ��There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it ...��

 The elf quaked from head to foot. 

 ��Kreacher drank, and as he drank he saw terrible thing ... Kreacher��s insides burned ... Kreacher 
cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only 
laughed ... He made Kreacher drink all the potion ... He dropped a locket into the empty basin ... 
He filled it with more potion.��

 ��And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island ... �� 

Harry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort��s white, snakelike face vanishing into 
darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within 
minutes, whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning poison caused its

��139ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

victim ... But here, Harry��s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how Kreacher had 
escaped. 

��Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island��s edge and he drank from the black lake ... 
and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface ... ��

 ��How did you get away?�� Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering.

 Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked Harry with his great, bloodshot eyes.

 ��Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,�� he said.

 ��I know �C but how did you escape the Inferi?��

 Kreacher did not seem to understand.

 ��Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,�� he repeated.

 ��I know, but �C ��

 ��Well, it��s obvious, isn��t it, Harry?�� said Ron. ��He Disapparated!��

 ��But ... you couldn��t Apparate in and out of that cave,�� said Harry, ��otherwise Dumbledore �C�� 

��Elf magic isn��t like wizard��s magic, is it?�� said Ron, ��I mean, they can Apparate and 
Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can��t.�� 

There was a silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such a mistake? 
But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy. 

��Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath his notice ... 
It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn��t.�� 

��The house-elf��s highest law is his Master��s bidding,�� intoned Kreacher. ��Kreacher was told to 
come home, so Kreacher came home ... �� 

��Well, then, you did what you were told, didn��t you?�� said Hermione kindly. ��You didn��t 
disobey orders at all!��

 Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever. 

��So what happened when you got back?�� Harry asked. ��What did Regulus say when you told 

him what happened?�� 

��Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,�� croaked Kreacher. ��Master Regulus told 
Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house. And then ... it was a little while later ... Master 
Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Master Regulus was strange, not as 
he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell ... and he asked Kreacher to take him to

��140ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord ... �� 

And so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the 
thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius ... Kreacher knew how to open the concealed 
entrance to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat, this time it was his beloved 
Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison ... 

 ��And he made you drink the poison?�� said Harry, disgusted. 

But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione��s hands leapt to her mouth. She seemed to 
have understood something. 

��M-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had,�� said 
Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. ��And he told Kreacher to take it 
and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets ...��

 Kreacher��s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to understand him. 

��And he order �C Kreacher to leave �C without him. And he told Kreacher �C to go home �C and 
never to tell my Mistress �C what he had done �C but to destroy �C the first locket. And he drank �C all 
the potion �C and Kreacher swapped the lockets �C and watched ... as Master Regulus ... was dragged 
beneath the water ... and ...��

 ��Oh, Kreacher!�� wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her knees beside the elf and 

tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, quite obviously repulsed.

 ��The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his Mistress say?�� 

��I told you not to call her ��Mudblood��!�� snarled Harry, but the elf was already punishing 
himself. He fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor. 

��Stop him �C stop him!�� Hermione cried. ��Oh, don��t you see now how sick it is, the way they��ve 
got to obey?��

 ��Kreacher �C stop, stop!�� shouted Harry. 

The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his snort, a 
bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and 
bloodshot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so pitiful. 

��So you brought the locket home,�� he said relentlessly, for he was determined to know the full 
story. ��And you tried to destroy it?�� 

��Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,�� moaned the elf. ��Kreacher tried everything,

��141ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would work ... So many powerful spells upon the casing. 
Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it would not open ... Kreacher 
punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey 
orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his mistress was mad with grief, because 
Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because 
Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave ...�� 

Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Tears flowed down 
Hermione��s cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who 
was no fan of Kreacher��s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head, trying 
to clear it. 

��I don��t understand you, Kreacher,�� he said finally. ��Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died 
to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy 
to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them ...�� 

��Harry, Kreacher doesn��t think like that,�� said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her 
hand. ��He��s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to 
Kreacher wasn��t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like 
Kreacher? He��s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus 
certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you��re going to 
say,�� she went on as Harry began to protest, ��that Regulus changed his mind ... but he doesn��t 
seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and 
Regulus��s family were all safest if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to 
protect them all.��

 ��Sirius �C �� 

��Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it��s no good looking like that, you know it��s true. 
Kreacher had been alone for such a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably 
starving for a bit of affection. I��m sure ��Miss Cissy�� and ��Miss Bella�� were perfectly lovely to 
Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to 
know. I��ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort 
did ... and so did Sirius.��

��142ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he remembered what 
Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius��s death, I do not think Sirius ever saw 
Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human��s ... 

 ��Kreacher,�� said Harry after a while, ��when you feel up to it, er ... please sit up.�� 

It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccupped himself into silence. Then he pushed himself 
into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child. 

��Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,�� said Harry. He glanced at Hermione for 
assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend that it 
was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval. She smiled 
encouragingly. 

��Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need to find out where 
the locket �C where Master Regulus��s locket is. It��s really important. We want to finish the work 
Master Regulus started, we want to �C er �C ensure that he didn��t die in vain.��

 Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry.

 ��Find Mundungus Fletcher?�� he croaked. 

��And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,�� said Harry. ��Do you think you could do that for 
us?�� 

As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid��s 
purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to 
Voldemort. 

��Kreacher, I��d, er, like you to have this,�� he said, pressing the locket into the elf��s hand. ��This 
belonged to Regulus and I��m sure he��d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you -�� 

��Overkill, mate,�� said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and 
misery, and threw himself back onto the ground. 

It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented 
with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. 
When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched 
him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its 
protection their first priority while he was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, 
and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione��s direction that might have been an attempt at a

��143ҳ��

respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.

Chapter Eleven 
The Bribe 


If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, 


Harry was 
confident that the capture of Mundungus would take 

a few hours at 
most, and he prowled the house all morning in a 

state of high 

anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, 
Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which 
Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help. 

Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had 
appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the 
direction of the house that they could not see. 

��Death Eaters, for sure,�� said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the drawing room 
windows. ��Reckon they know we��re in here?�� 

��I don��t think so,�� said Hermione, though she looked frightened, ��or they��d have sent Snape in 
after us, wouldn��t they?�� 

��D��you reckon he��s been in here and has his tongue tied by Moody��s curse?�� asked Ron. 

��Yes,�� said Hermione, ��otherwise he��d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn��t he? 

But they��re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, 

after all.�� 

��How do they -?�� began Harry. 

��Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They��ll know Sirius left you the 

place.�� 

The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. 
They had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley��s Patronus, 
and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of 
playing with the Deluminator in his pocket. This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was 
whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not 
appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off. 

��Will you stop it!�� she cried on the third evening of Kreacher��s absence, as all the light was

��145ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sucked from the drawing room yet again. 

��Sorry, sorry!�� said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. ��I don��t know I��m 
doing it!�� 

��Well, can��t you find something useful to occupy yourself?�� 

��What, like reading kids�� stories?�� 

��Dumbledore left me this book, Ron �C�� 

����and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I��m supposed to use it!�� 

Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. He 
headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where 
Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he 
heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain. 

Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten. He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows 
beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened, He saw a glimpse of the lamplit 
square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder 
took a step forward, and Moody��s voice asked, ��Severus Snape?�� Then the dust figure rose from 
the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand. 

��It was not I who killed you, Albus,�� said a quiet voice. 

The jinx broke. The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make out the 
newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind. 

Harry pointed the wand into the middle of it. ��Don��t move!�� 

He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black. At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew 
open and she began to scream, ��Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house �C�� 

Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the 
unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below. 

��Hold your fire, it��s me, Remus!�� 

��Oh, thank goodness,�� said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a 

bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did 

not. 

��Show yourself!�� he called back. 

Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender.

��146ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the 
Marauder��s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to 
produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.�� 

��Oh, all right,�� said Harry, lowering his wand, ��but I had to check, didn��t I?�� 

��Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to 
check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn��t be so quick to lower your defenses.�� 

They ran down the stairs towards him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, he looked 
exhausted, but pleased to see them. 

��No sign of Severus, then?�� he asked. 

��No,�� said Harry. ��What��s going on? Is everyone okay?�� 

��Yes,�� said Lupin, ��but we��re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the 

square outside �C�� 

��We know �C�� 

��I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they 
would not see me. They can��t know you��re in here or I��m sure they��d have more people out there; 
they��re staking out everywhere that��s got any connection with you, Harry. Let��s go downstairs, 
there��s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.�� 

They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate. A fire sprang 
up instantly. It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long 
wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down. 

��I��d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,�� said 
Lupin. ��So, you came straight here after the wedding?�� 

��No,�� said Harry, ��only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a caf�� on Tottenham Court 
Road.�� 

Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. ��What?�� 

They explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast. 

��But how did they find you so quickly? It��s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless 
you grab hold of them as they disappear.�� 

��And it doesn��t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, 
does it?�� said Harry.

��147ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We wondered,�� said Hermione tentatively, ��whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?�� 

��Impossible,�� said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. ��Apart from 
anything else, they��d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn��t they? 
But I can��t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that��s worrying, really 
worrying.�� 

He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait. 

��Tell us what happened after we left, we haven��t heard a thing since Ron��s dad told us the 
family was safe.�� 

��Well, Kingsley saved us,�� said Lupin. ��Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were 
able to Disapparate before they arrived.�� 

��Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?�� interjected Hermione. 

��A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they��re the same thing now,�� said Lupin. ��There 
were about a dozen of them, but they didn��t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that 
they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it��s true, he 
didn��t give you away.�� 

Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude 
he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man��s final act 
had been to try to protect Harry. 

��The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,�� Lupin went on. ��They found the 
ghoul, but didn��t want to get too close �C and then they interrogated those of us who remained for 
hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the 
Order knew that you had been there. 

��At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing 
their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,�� he added quickly, 
forestalling the question, ��but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle��s house, but as 
you know he wasn��t there, and they used the Cruciarus Curse on Tonks��s family. Again, trying to 
find out where you went after you visited them. They��re all right �C shaken, obviously, but 
otherwise okay.�� 

��The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?�� Harry asked, remembering how 
effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks��s parents�� garden. 

��148ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��What you��ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the 
Ministry on their side now,�� said Lupin. ��They��ve got the power to perform brutal spells without 
fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we��d cast against 
them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they��d come.�� 

��And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry��s whereabouts out of people?�� 

asked Hermione, an edge to her voice. 

��Well,�� Lupin said. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet. 

��Here,�� he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, ��you��ll know sooner or later anyway. 
That��s their pretext for going after you.�� 

Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. He read 
the headline over it, 

WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT 
THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 


Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the newspaper 
away; he did not want to read anymore, He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had 
been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita 
Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place 
moments after Dumbledore had fallen. 

��I��m sorry, Harry,�� Lupin said. 

��So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?�� asked Hermione furiously. 

Lupin nodded. 

��But surely people realize what��s going on?�� 

��The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,�� said Lupin. 

��The official version of Scrimgeour��s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius 
Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.�� 

��Why didn��t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?�� asked Ron. 

Lupin laughed. 

��He doesn��t need to, Ron. Effectively, he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at

��149ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free 
to extend his power beyond the Ministry. 

��Naturally many people have deduced what has happened. There has been such a dramatic 
change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be 
behind it. However, that is the point. They whisper. They daren��t confide in each other, not 
knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their 
families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have 
provoked open rebellion. Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.�� 

��And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,�� said Harry, ��involves warning the Wizarding 
world against me instead of Voldemort?�� 

��That��s certainly a part of it,�� said Lupin, ��and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is 
dead, you �C the Boy Who Lived �C were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance 
to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero��s death, Voldemort has not 
only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended 
you. 

��Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.�� 

Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet. 

��Look at page two.�� 

Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had when handling 
Secrets of the Darkest Art. 

��Muggle-born Register!�� she read aloud. ����The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-
called ��Muggle-borns�� the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets. 

����Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be 
passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry 
exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or 
force. 

����The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has 
issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the 
newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.���� 

��People won��t let this happen,�� said Ron. 

��150ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It is happening, Ron,�� said Lupin. ��Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.�� 

��But how are they supposed to have 'stolen' magic?�� said Ron. ��It��s mental, if you could steal 
magic there wouldn��t be any Squibs, would there?�� 

��I know,�� said Lupin. ��Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close 
Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must 
suffer the punishment.�� 

Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, ��What if purebloods and halfbloods swear a Muggle-born��s 
part of their family? I��ll tell everyone Hermione��s my cousin �C�� 

Hermione covered Ron��s hand with hers and squeezed it. ��Thank you, Ron, but I couldn��t let 
you �C�� 

��You won��t have a choice,�� said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. ��I��ll teach you my family 
tree so you can answer questions on it.�� 

Hermione gave a shaky laugh. 

��Ron, as we��re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don��t 
think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What��s Voldemort planning for 
Hogwarts?�� she asked Lupin. 

��Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,�� he replied. ��That was 
announced yesterday. It��s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly 
every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to 
teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the 
whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it��s also another way of 
weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status �C meaning that they have 
proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent �C before they are allowed to attend.�� 

Harry felt sickened and angry. At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over 
stacks of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps 
never see their families again either. 

��It��s ... it��s ...�� he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, 

but Lupin said quietly, ��I know.�� 

Lupin hesitated. 

��I��ll understand if you can��t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that

��151ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Dumbledore left you a mission.�� 

��He did,�� Harry replied, ��and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they��re coming with me.�� 

��Can you confide in me what the mission is?�� 

Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that 

he could return a different answer. 

��I can��t, Remus, I��m sorry. If Dumbledore didn��t tell you I don��t think I can.�� 

��I thought you��d say that,�� said Lupin, looking disappointed. ��But I might still be of some use to 
you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There 
would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.�� 

Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their 
mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine. 

Hermione, however, looked puzzled. ��But what about Tonks?�� she asked. 

��What about her?�� said Lupin. 

��Well,�� said Hermione, frowning, ��you��re married! How does she feel about you going away 

with us?�� 

��Tonks will be perfectly safe,�� said Lupin, ��She��ll be at her parents�� house.�� 

There was something strange in Lupin��s tone, it was almost cold. There was also something odd 

in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents�� house; she was, after all, a member of the 

Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action. 

��Remus,�� said Hermione tentatively, ��is everything all right ... you know ... between you and �C �� 

��Everything is fine, thank you,�� said Lupin pointedly. 

Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed one, and then 

Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, ��Tonks is going to have a 

baby.�� 

��Oh, how wonderful!�� squealed Hermione. 

��Excellent!�� said Ron enthusiastically. 

��Congratulations,�� said Harry. 

Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, ��So ... do you accept my 
offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he 
appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I

��152ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.�� 

Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry. 

��Just �C just to be clear,�� he said. ��You want to leave Tonks at her parents�� house and come away 
with us?�� 

��She��ll be perfectly safe there, they��ll look after her,�� said Lupin. He spoke with a finality 
bordering on indifference, ��Harry, I��m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.�� 

��Well,�� said Harry slowly, ��I��m not. I��m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why 
you aren��t sticking with your own kid, actually.�� 

Lupin��s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. 
Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione��s eyes 
swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin. 

��You don��t understand,�� said Lupin at last. 

��Explain, then,�� said Harry. 

Lupin swallowed. 

��I �C I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and have 
regretted it very much every since.�� 

��I see,�� said Harry, ��so you��re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?�� 

Lupin sprang to his feet, His chair toppled over backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that 
Harry saw, for the first time ever, the shadow of the wolf upon his human face. 

��Don��t you understand what I��ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have 
married her. I��ve made her an outcast!�� 

Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. 

��You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore��s protection at 
Hogwarts! You don��t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they 
know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don��t you see what I��ve done? 

��Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to 
marry a werewolf? And the child �C the child �C �� 

Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged. 

��My kind don��t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it �C how can I forgive 

myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by

��153ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of 
whom it must always be ashamed!�� 

��Remus!�� whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. ��Don��t say that �C how could any child be 
ashamed of you?�� 

��Oh, I don��t know, Hermione,�� said Harry. ��I��d be pretty ashamed of him.�� 

Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too. 

Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him. 

��If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,�� Harry said, ��what will they do to a half-
werewolf whose father��s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and 
you reckon he��d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?�� 

��How �C how dare you?�� said Lupin. ��This is not about a desire for �C for danger or personal 
glory �C how dare you suggest such a �C�� 

��I think you��re feeling a bit of a daredevilͦ������ ,�� Harry said, ��You fancy stepping into 
Sirius��s shoes �C�� 

��Harry, no!�� Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin��s livid face. 

��I��d never have believed this,�� Harry said. ��The man who taught me to fight dementors �C a 

coward.�� 

Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang 
and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to 
the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin��s cloak disappearing around the door. 

��Remus, Remus, come back!�� Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they 

heard the front door slam. 

��Harry!�� wailed Hermione. ��How could you?�� 

��It was easy,�� said Harry. He stood up, he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the 

wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking. 

��Don��t look at me like that!�� he snapped at Hermione. 

��Don��t you start on her!�� snarled Ron. 

��No �C no �C we mustn��t fight!�� said Hermione, launching herself between them. 

��You shouldn��t have said that stuff to Lupin,�� Ron told Harry. 

��He had it coming to him,�� said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind,

��154ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and 

his mother��s voice, begging for mercy ... 

��Parents,�� said Harry, ��shouldn��t leave their kids unless �C unless they��ve got to.�� 

��Harry �C�� said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked 
away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that 
fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin��s tortured 
white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron 
nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, 
communicating silently. 

He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other. 

��I know I shouldn��t have called him a coward.�� 

��No, you shouldn��t,�� said Ron at once. 

��But he��s acting like one.�� 

��All the same ...�� said Hermione. 

��I know,�� said Harry. ��But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it��ll be worth it, won��t it?�� 

He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry 
looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had 
said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend? 

The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and 
Hermione��s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the 
table, Harry��s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat 
down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words; his mind 
was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed 
their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and 
Dumbledore��s name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the 
photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words, The 
Dumbledore family, left to right, Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra, and 
Aberforth. 

His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore��s father, Percival, 
was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The

��155ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

baby, Ariana, was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother, 
Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry 
thought of photos of Native Americans he��d seen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, 
and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore 
matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several 
years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus��s nose had 
been broken and before he started wearing glasses. 

The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the newspaper. Baby 
Ariana��s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the picture and saw the 
headline, 

EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM UPCOMING 
BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 
by Rita Skeeter 

Thinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry began to read, 

Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold 
after her husband Percival��s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She 
therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric��s Hollow, the village that was 
later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter��s strange escape from You-Know-Who. 

Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric��s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, 
but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about her husband��s crime 
she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new 
Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family was left well alone. 

��Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of 
homemade Cauldron Cakes,�� says Bathilda Bagshot. ��The first year they were there I only ever 
saw the two boys. Wouldn��t have known there was a daughter if I hadn��t been picking 
Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out 
into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took 
her back inside. Didn��t know what to make of it.��

��156ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric��s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to 
hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing 
was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is 
the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody 
now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It 
seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter��s existence rather than 
suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends 
and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The 
tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana��s existence could be counted upon to 
keep the secret, including her two brothers, who had deflected awkward questions with the 
answer their mother had taught them. ��My sister is too frail for school.��

 Next week, Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts �C the Prizes and the Pretense. 

Harry had been wrong. What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He looked back at 
the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to 
go to Godric��s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him, he wanted to visit the 
place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the 
newspaper, to ask Ron��s and Hermione��s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the 
kitchen. 

For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His immediate thought 
was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of 
struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feet as 
Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, ��Kreacher has returned with the 
thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.��

 Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him. 
��Expelliarmus!�� 
Mundungus��s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived 


for the stairs. Ron rugby-tackled (bring down (as in football) him and Mundungus hit the stone 
floor with a muffled crunch. 
��What?�� he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron��s grip. ��Wha��ve I 
done? Setting a bleedin�� house-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha��ve I done, lemme go,

��157ҳ��

lemme go, or �C�� 

��You��re not in much of a position to make threats,�� said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, 
crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped 
struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand 
deliberately at Mundungus��s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair 
was matted and his robes stained. 

��Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,�� croaked the elf. ��Fletcher 
knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher 
cornered the thief in the end.��

 ��You��ve done really well, Kreacher,�� said Harry, and the elf bowed low. 

 ��Right, we��ve got a few questions for you,�� Harry told Mundungus, who shouted at once. 

��I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never volunteered to 
die for you, an�� that was bleedin�� You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta 

there. I said all along I didn��t wanna do it �C��

 ��For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,�� said Hermione. 

��Well, you��re a bunch of bleedin' 'eroes then, aren��t you, but I never pretended I was up for 

killing meself �C�� 

��We��re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,�� said Harry, moving his wand a little 
closer to Mundungus��s baggy, bloodshot eyes. ��We already knew you were an unreliable bit of 
scum.�� 

��Well then, why the 'ell am I being 'unted down by 'ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblets 
again? I ain��t got none of 'em left, or you could 'ave 'em �C�� 

��It��s not about the goblets either, although you��re getting warmer,�� said Harry. ��Shut up and 
listen.�� 

It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand some small 
portion of truth. Harry��s wand was now so close to the bridge of Mundungus��s nose that 
Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. 

��When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,�� Harry began, but Mundungus 
interrupted him again.

 ��Sirius never cared about any of the junk �C��

��158ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

There was the sound of pattering (sound of footsteps) feet, a blaze of shining copper, an 
echoing clang, and a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the 
head with a saucepan. 

��Call 'im off, call 'im off, 'e should be locked up!�� screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher 

raised the heavy-bottomed pan again.

 ��Kreacher, no!�� shouted Harry.

 Kreacher��s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft.

 ��Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?��

 Ron laughed. 

��We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the honors,�� said 
Harry. 

��Thank you very much, Master,�� said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, 
his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. 

��When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,�� Harry began again, ��you 
took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.�� Harry��s mouth was 
suddenly dry. He could sense Ron and Hermione��s tension and excitement too. ��What did you do 
with it?��

 ��Why?�� asked Mundungus. ��Is it valuable?��

 ��You��ve still got it!�� cried Hermione. 

��No, he hasn��t,�� said Ron shrewdly. ��He��s wondering whether he should have asked more 
money for it.�� 

��More?�� said Mundungus. ��That wouldn��t have been effing (Slang) damned difficult ... 

bleedin�� gave it away, di��n�� I? No choice.��

 ��What do you mean?�� 

��I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I��ve got a license for trading 

in magical artifacts. Bleedin�� snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an�� 

told me she��d take it and let me off that time, and to fink (inform) meself lucky.��

 ��Who was this woman?�� asked Harry. 

��I dunno, some Ministry hag.�� Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. ��Little 

woman. Bow on top of 'er head.��

��159ҳ��

He frowned and then added, ��Looked like a toad.�� 

Harry dropped his wand, It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, 
which ignited. 

��Aquamenti!�� screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulfing a 
spluttering and choking Mundungus. 

Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron��s and Hermione��s faces. The scars on 
the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again.

Chapter Twelve 

Magic is Might 

As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the 


middle of 
Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle 

and brown. 
The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by 

anyone in 
the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve itself. 

The 
muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since 

accepted 
the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number 
thirteen. 

And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly 
most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with 
no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and 
thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days 
running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners 
who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of 
them might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat. 

The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Occasionally one of 
them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back 
looking disappointed. 

On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. 
Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and 
thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, 
bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of 
those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with 
the twisted face pointed and his closest companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a 
moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and 
disappointed. 

Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly lost his

��161ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death 
Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door 
carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along 
the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet 
clutched in his hand. 

The usual low whisper of ��Severus Snape�� greeted him, the chill wind swept him, and his 
tongue rolled up for a moment. 

��I didn��t kill you,�� he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure 
exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. 
Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, ��I��ve got news, and you won��t like it.�� 

The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone; Copper pots and pans had 
been burnished (polish) to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates 
already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was 
simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically different than the house-elf who 
now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean and fluffy 
as cotton woolԭ��, Regulus��s locket bouncing on his thin chest. 

��Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,�� croaked Kreacher, 
seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number 
of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered. 

��What��s happened?�� Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf 
of scribbled notes and hand drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now 
they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their 
scattered parchment. 

A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a 
headline that read, 

SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER 

��No!�� said Ron and Hermione loudly. 

Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying 
story out loud. 

��162ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry, 
was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient 
school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take 
over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts 
professor.�� 

����I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values �C ��Like 
committing murder and cutting off people��s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in 
Dumbledore��s study �C Merlin��s pants!�� she shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt 
up from the table and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, ��I��ll be back in a minute!�� 

����Merlin��s pants��?�� repeated Ron, looking amused. ��She must be upset.�� He pulled the 
newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape. 

��The other teachers won��t stand for this, McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the 
truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won��t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are 
these Carrows?�� 

��Death Eaters,�� said Harry. ��There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the 
tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it��s all friends together. And,�� Harry went on bitterly, 
drawing up a chair, ��I can��t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the 
Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it��ll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice 
few years in Azkaban �C and that��s if they��re lucky. I reckon they��ll stay to try and protect the 
students.�� 

Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands, and ladled out soup into 
pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so. 

��Thanks, Kreacher,�� said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape��s 
face. ��Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.�� 

He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher��s cooking had improved 
dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus��s locket. Today��s French onion was as good as 
Harry had ever tasted. 

��There are still a load of Death Eaters watching this house,�� he told Ron as he ate, ��more than 
usual. It��s like they��re hoping we��ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the 
Hogwarts Express.��

��163ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Ron glanced at his watch. 

��I��ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn��t 
it?�� 

In his mind��s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once 
followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure 
Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, 
and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape��s new regime.

 ��They nearly saw me coming back in just now,�� Harry said, ��I landed badly on the top step, and 
the Cloak slipped.�� 

��I do that every time. Oh, here she is,�� Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch 
Hermione reentering the kitchen. ��And what in the name of Merlin��s most baggy Y Fronts was that 
about?��

 ��I remembered this,�� Hermione panted. 

She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her 
small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting 
inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag, within a few 
seconds it had vanished, like so much ease, into the bag��s capacious depths. 

��Phineas Nigellus,�� Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the 
usual sonorous, clanking crash. 

��Sorry?�� said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was 
able to travel between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster��s 
office at Hogwarts, the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in 
triumphant possession of Dumbledore��s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone 
Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor. 

��Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,�� Hermione explained to 
Ron as she resumed her seat. ��But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the 
inside of my handbag.��

 ��Good thinking!�� said Ron, looking impressed. 

��Thank you,�� smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. ��So, Harry, what else happened 
today?��

��164ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Nothing,�� said Harry. ��Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw 
your dad though, Ron. He looks fine.�� 

Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try 
and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was 
always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring to catch these glimpses 
of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious. 

��Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,�� Ron said. 
��That��s why we haven��t seen Umbridge, she��d never walk, she��d think she��s too important.�� 

��And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?�� Hermione 
asked. 

 ��Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,�� said Ron. 

��How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?�� Hermione asked, her soupspoon 

suspended in midair.

 ��Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.��

 ��But you never told us that!�� 

Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and 
Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen. 

��There��s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!�� she said, flipping feverishly through 
the pages. 

 ��Well, does it really matter?�� 

��Ron, it all matters! If we��re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when 
they��re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We��ve been over and 
over this, I mean, what��s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren��t even bothering to 
tell us �C��

 ��Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing �C �� 

��You do realize, don��t you, that there��s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world 
for us to be right now than the Ministry of �C��

 ��I think we should do it tomorrow,�� said Harry.

 Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup. 

 ��Tomorrow?�� repeated Hermione. ��You aren��t serious, Harry?��

��165ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I am,�� said Harry. ��I don��t think we��re going to be much better prepared than we are now even 
if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther 
away that locket could be. There��s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing 
doesn��t open.��

 ��Unless,�� said Ron, ��she��s found a way of opening it and she��s now possessed.��

 ��Wouldn��t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,�� Harry shrugged. 

 Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought. 

��We know everything important,�� Harry went on, addressing Hermione. ��We know they��ve 
stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members 
are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two 
Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge��s office is, because of 
what you heard the bearded bloke saying to his mate �C��

 ����I��ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,���� Hermione recited immediately. 

��Exactly,�� said Harry. ��And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or 
whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend �C ��

 ��But we haven��t got any!��

 ��If the plan works, we will have,�� Harry continued calmly. 

��I don��t know, Harry, I don��t know ... There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so 
much relies on chance ...�� 

��That��ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,�� said Harry. ��It��s time to 
act.�� 

He could tell from Ron��s and Hermione��s faces that they were scared; he was not particularly 
confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation. 

They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy 
on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since 
childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, 
and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the 
same time every day. Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of 
somebody��s briefcase. Slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of 
Hermione.

��166ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��All right,�� said Ron slowly, ��let��s say we go for it tomorrow ... I think it should just be me and 

Harry.��

 ��Oh, don��t start that again!�� sighed Hermione. ��I thought we��d settled this.�� 

��It��s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different. Hermione,�� 
Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously. ��You��re on the list 
of Muggle-borns who didn��t present themselves for interrogation!�� 

��And you��re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If anyone shouldn��t go, it��s 
Harry, he��s got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head �C��

 ��Fine, I��ll stay here,�� said Harry. ��Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won��t you?�� 

As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry��s forehead. His hand 
jumped to it. He saw Hermione��s eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing 
his hair out of his eyes. 

��Well, if all three of us go, we��ll have to Disapparate separately,�� Ron was saying. ��We can��t 
all fit under the Cloak anymore.�� 

Harry��s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried 
forward. 

��Master has not finished his soup, would master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart 
to which Master is so partial?��

 ��Thanks, Kreacher, but I��ll be back in a minute �C er �C bathroom.�� 

Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and 
then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting 
with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and 
closed his eyes ... . 

He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, timbered 
gables; they looked like gingerbread houses. He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness 
of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a mounting excitement ... 

The door opened. A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into Harry��s face, 

humor gone, terror replacing it.

 ��Gregorovitch?�� said a high, cold voice. 

She shook her head. She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, prevented

��167ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

her shutting him out ... 

 ��I want Gregorovitch.�� 

��Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!�� she cried, shaking her head. ��He no live here! He no live here! I 
know him not!�� 

Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark hall, and 
Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand. 

 ��Where is he?��

 ��Das weiff ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!�� 

He raised his hand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. She tried to 

shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light �C 

 ��Harry! HARRY!��

 He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on the door again.

 ��Harry, open up!�� 

He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at 

once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking 

unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.

 ��What were you doing?�� asked Hermione sternly.

 ��What d��you think I was doing?�� asked Harry with feeble bravado��������. 

 ��You were yelling your head off!�� said Ron. 

 ��Oh yeah ... I must��ve dozed off or �C�� 

��Harry, please don��t insult our intelligence,�� said Hermione, taking deep breaths. ��We know 

your scar hurt downstairs, and you��re white as a sheet.��

 Harry sat down on the edge of the bath. 

��Fine. I��ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he��s probably killed her whole 

family. And he didn��t need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there ...�� 

��Harry, you aren��t supposed to let this happen anymore!�� Hermione cried, her voice echoing 
through the bathroom. ��Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! HE thought the connection 
was dangerous �C Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how 
can it help?��

 ��Because it means I know what he��s doing,�� said Harry.

��168ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��So you��re not even going to try to shut him out?��

 ��Hermione, I can��t. You know I��m lousy at Occlumency. I never got the hang of it.�� 

��You never really tried!�� she said hotly. ��I don��t get it, Harry �C do you like having this special 
connection or relationship or what �C whatever �C��

 She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up. 

 ��Like it?�� he said quietly. ��Would you like it?��

 ��I �C no �C I��m sorry, Harry. I just didn��t mean �C�� 

��I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he��s most 

dangerous. But I��m going to use it.��

 ��Dumbledore �C�� 

��Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else��s. I want to know why he��s after 

Gregorovitch.��

 ��Who?�� 

��He��s a foreign wandmaker,�� said Harry. ��He made Krum��s wand and Krum reckons he��s 
brilliant.�� 

��But according to you,�� said Ron, ��Voldemort��s got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he��s 
already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?�� 

��Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better ... or else he thinks 
Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me, because 
Ollivander didn��t know.�� 

Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical 
looks behind his back. 

��Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,�� said Hermione, ��but you made it happen! 
Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?�� 

��Because I know it wasn��t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really 
happened!�� 

They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was 
marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was 
permitting himself to see into Voldemort��s mind. 

To his relief, Ron intervened.

��169ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Drop it,�� he advised her. ��It��s up to him. And if we��re going to the Ministry tomorrow, don��t 
you reckon we should go over the plan?�� 

Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though Harry was quite 
sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement 
kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart. 

They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan 
until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. 

Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius��s room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained��׼ on 
the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for 
another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice 
Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he though of 
Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort 
sought him so determinedly.

 Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.

 ��You look terrible,�� was Ron��s greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry.

 ��Not for long,�� said Harry, yawning. 

They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and hot rolls by 
Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review. 

��Robes,�� she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and 
continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, ��Polyjuice Potion ... Invisibiliity Cloak ... Decoy 
Detonators ... You should each take a couple just in case ... Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Norgat, 
Extendable Ears ...�� 

They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and 
promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned. 

��Bless him,�� said Ron fondly, ��and when you think I used to fantasize about cutting off his 
head and sticking it on the wall.�� 

They made their way onto the front step with immense caution. They could see a couple of 
puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square. 

 Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry. 

After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny

��170ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, 
except for a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not usually appear here until at 
least eight o��clock. 

��Right then,�� said Hermione, checking her watch. ��she ought to be here in about five minutes. 
When I��ve Stunned her �C�� 

��Hermione, we know,�� said Ron sternly. ��And I thought we were supposed to open the door 
before she got here?��

 Hermione squealed. ��I nearly forgot! Stand back �C�� 

She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door (emergency exist) beside 
them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their 
careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make it 
look as thought it was still closed. 

��And now,�� she said, turning back to face the other two in the alleyway, ��we put on the Cloak 
again �C��

 ����and we wait,�� Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione��s head like a blanket over a birdcage 
and rolling his eyes at Harry. 

Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway 
gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness, the sun had just 
come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, 
before Hermione��s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over. 

��Nicely done, Hermione,�� said Ron, emerging behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry 
took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that 
led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch��s head and added them to a flask of 
muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little 
witch��s handbag. 

��She��s Mafalda Hopkirk,�� he said, reading a small card that identified their victim as an 
assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. ��You��d better take this, Hermione, and here are the 
tokens.�� 

He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., which he had 
taken from the witch��s purse.

Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, and within 
seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda��s spectacles 
and put them on, Harry checked his watch. 

 ��We��re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.�� 

They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda. Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak 
over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, 
and a small, ferrety looking wizard appeared before them.

 ��Oh, hello, Mafalda.��

 ��Hello!�� said Hermione in a quavery voice, ��How are you today?��

 ��Not so good, actually,�� replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast. 

 As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them. 

��I��m sorry to hear you��re under the weather,�� said Hermione, talking firmly over the little 
wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the 

street. ��Here, have a sweet.��

 ��Eh? Oh, no thanks �C��

 ��I insist!�� said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. 

Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one. 

The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the little wizard 
started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from 
the top of his head. 

��Oh dear!�� she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. ��Perhaps you��d better take the day 
off!�� 

��No �C no!�� He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk 
straight. ��I must �C today �C must go �C�� 

��But that��s just silly!�� said Hermione, alarmed. ��You can��t go to work in this state �C I think you 
ought to go to St. Mungo��s and get them to sort you out.�� 

The wizard had collapsed, heaving��Ϣ ,��� , onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the 
main street.

 ��You simply can��t go to work like this!�� cried Hermione. 

At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a repulsed Hermione to claw his way

��172ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the 
bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit. 

��Urgh,�� said Hermione, holding up the skirt�°� ,��Ե of her robe to avoid the puddles of 
sick. ��It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.�� 

��Yeah,�� said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard��s bag, ��but I still think a 
whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn��t 
he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.�� 

Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and 
wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag. 

��Weird he wasn��t wearing them today, wasn��t it, seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, 
I��m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.�� 

��Now wait here,�� Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, ��and we��ll 
be back with some hairs for you.�� 

He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in the sick-
splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione 
reappeared. 

��We don��t know who he is,�� Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black hairs, ��but he��s 
gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he��s pretty tall, you��ll need bigger robes ...�� 

She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take 
the potion and change. 

Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, from what he 
could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the 
Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two. 

 ��Blimey, that��s scary,�� said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him.

 ��Take one of Mafalda��s tokens,�� Hermione told Harry, ��and let��s go, it��s nearly nine.�� 

They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were 
spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs, one labeled GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. 

��See you in a moment, then,�� said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to 
LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to 
be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white.

��173ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Morning, Reg!�� called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by 
inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. ��Blooming pain in the bum (British slang) 
buttocks, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry 
Potter?�� 

The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. ��Yeah,�� he said, 

��stupid, isn��t it?��

 And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. 

To Harry��s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and peered through the 

gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet 

next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him.

 ��We have to flush ourselves in?�� he whispered. 

 ��Looks like it,�� Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly.

 They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet. 

He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he appeared to be standing in water, 
his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment 
had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic. 

He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. The great 
Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the 
center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. 
Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this vast 
sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry 
workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the 
statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT. 

Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs. Another wizard had just flown out of the 

fireplace behind him.

 ��Out of the way, can��t y �C oh, sorry, Runcorn.�� 

Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man who Harry was 
impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating. 

��Psst!�� said a voice, and he looked around to see a whispy little witch and the ferrety wizard 
from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join

��174ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

them.

 ��You got in all right, then?�� Hermione whispered to Harry.

 ��No, he��s still stuck in the hog,�� said Ron. 

��Oh, very funny ... It��s horrible, isn��t it?�� she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue. 

��Have you seen what they��re sitting on?�� 

Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved 
thrones were actually mounds of carved humans, hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, 
women and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the 
weight of the handsomely robed wizards. 

 ��Muggles,�� whispered Hermione, ��In their rightful place. Come on, let��s get going.�� 

They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the 
hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of 
Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were 
forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest 
one when a voice said, ��Cattermole!�� 

They looked around, Harry��s stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed 
Dumbledore��s death was striding toward them. The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their 
eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The man��s scowling, slightly brutish 
face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with 
much gold thread. 

Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically, ��Morning, Yaxley!�� Yaxley 
ignored them. 

��I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, Cattermole. It��s still 
raining in there.��

 Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody spoke. 

 ��Raining ... in your office? That��s �C that��s not good, is it?��

 Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley��s eyes widened. ��You think it��s funny, Cattermole, do you?��

 A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off. 

 ��No,�� said Ron, ��no, of course �C�� 

��You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I��m

��175ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

quite surprised you��re not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a 
bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.�� 

Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She cough feebly and 
turned away.

 ��I �C I �C�� stammered Ron. 

��But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,�� said Yaxley, ����not that any woman I 
married would ever be mistaken for such filth �C and the Head of Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do this job, Cattermole. Do you 
understand me?��

 ��Yes,�� whispered Ron. 

��Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an hour, your 
wife��s Blood Status will be in even greater doubt than it is now.�� 

The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who 
was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward 
another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them. It was as if they 
were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward. 

��What am I going to do?�� Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. ��If I don��t turn 
up, my wife ... I mean, Cattermole��s wife �C�� 

��We��ll come with you, we should stick together �C�� began Harry, but Ron shook his head 
feverishly. 

��That��s mental, we haven��t got much time. You two find Umbridge, I��ll go and sort out 
Yaxley��s office �C but how do I stop a raining?�� 

��Try Finite Incantatem,�� said Hermione at once, ��that should stop the rain if it��s a hex or curse; 
if it doesn��t something��s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to 
fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings �C�� 

��Say it again, slowly �C�� said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, but at that 
moment the lift juddered (shudder) to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, ��Level four, 
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and 
Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau,�� and the grilles slid open 
again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around

��176ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.

 ��Morning, Albert,�� said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He glanced over at Ron and 
Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more; Hermione was now whispering frantic 
instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttering ��Dirk Cresswell, eh? 
From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I��m pretty confident I��ll get his job now!�� 

He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; the grilles 
opened once more. 

��Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic 
Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services,�� said the disembodied 
witch��s voice. 

Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed by the other 
wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione 
said, very fast, ��Actually, Harry, I think I��d better go after him, I don��t think he knows what he��s 
doing and if he gets caught the whole thing �C��

 ��Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.��

 The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood before them, two of 
them deep in conversation, a long-haired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and 
a squat, toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her 
chest.

Chapter Thirteen 
The Muggle-Born Registration Commission 


��Ah, Mafalda!�� said Umbridge, looking at 


Hermione. 

��Travers sent you, did he?��

 ��Y-yes,�� squeaked Hermione. 

��God, you��ll do perfectly well.�� Umbridge 

spoke to the 
wizard in black and gold. ��That��s that 

problem 
solved. Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for 

record-keeping 
we shall be able to start straightaway.�� She 

consulted her 
clipboard. ��Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut... even 
here, in the heart of the Ministry!�� She stepped into the lift besides Hermione, as did the two 
wizards who had been listening to Umbridge��s conversation with the Minister. ��We��ll go straight 
down, Mafalda, you��ll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, aren��t 
you getting out?��

 ��Yes, of course,�� said Harry in Runcorn��s deep voice. 

Harry stepped out of the life. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. Glancing over his 
shoulder, Harry saw Hermione��s anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side 
of her, Umbridge��s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. 

��What brings you here, Runcorn?�� asked the new Minister of Magic. His long black hair and 
beard were streaked with silver and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, 
putting Harry in the mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock. 

��Needed a quick word with,�� Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, ��Arthur Weasley. 

Someone said he was up on level one.��

 ��Ah,�� said Plum Thicknesse. ��Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?��

 ��No,�� said Harry, his throat dry. ��No, nothing like that.�� 

��Ah, well. It��s only a matter of time,�� said Thicknesse. ��If you ask me, the blood traitors are as 

bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.��

 ��Good day, Minister.�� 

Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The moment the

��178ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy 
black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. Runcorn 
was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden. 

Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming 
wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner��s name and occupation upon it, the 
might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself upon him so that 
the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks 
seemed laughably childish. They had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being 
detected. They had not given a moment��s thought to what they would do if they were forced to 
separate. 

Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was 
struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman��s liberty possibly depending 
on the outcome, and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly 
well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift. 

He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The silence pressed 
upon him. There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here, the purple-carpeted corridors were 
as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the place. 

Her office must be up here, Harry thought. 

It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but on the other 
hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off along the corridor again, 
passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in 
front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment. 

Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway along the next 
corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at 
small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. 
Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. They were all waving and 
twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like 
little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, 
that the papers all formed the same pattern and after a few more seconds he realized what he was

��179ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

watching was the creation of pamphlets �C that the paper squares were pages, which, when 
assembled, folded and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. 

Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he 
doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the 
pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink cover was 
emblazoned with a golden title, 

MUDBLOODS 

and the Dangers They Pose to 
a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society 

Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals, 
being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no author��s name upon the 
pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. 
Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her 
wand, ��Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?�� 

��Careful,�� said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and 

fell to the floor. 

 ��What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?��

 The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; 
Harry looked too, and the rage reared in him like a snake. Where there might have been a peephole 
on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris��Ĥ had been set into the wood 

�C an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody. 
For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there. He even forgot that 
he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving. It 
gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read, 

Dolores Umbridge 
Senior Undersecretary to the Minister


 Below that a slightly shinier new plaque read, 
Head of the Muggle-Born 
Registration Commission


��180ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers. Though they were intent upon their work, he 
could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of 
them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a 
rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator 
on the ground. 

It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him. A few 
moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud 
bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner. The young witch in the front row 
shrieked. Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the 
source of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge��s office, and closed 
the door behind him. 

He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge��s office at Hogwarts. 
Lace draperies, doilies and dried flowers covered every surface. The walls bore the same 
ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, be-ribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with 
sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy���Ժ�Ҷ�� , flowered cloth. Behind 
Mad-eye��s eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side 
of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy 
Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical 
eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. The he turned to face the room again, raised his wand, 
and murmured, ��Accio Locket.�� 

Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge knew all about protective 
charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open all the drawers. 
He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their 
drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no 
sign of a locket. 

There was a filing cabinet behind the desk, Harry set to searching it. Like Filch��s filing cabinet 
at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the 
bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from the search: Mr. Weasley's file.

 He pulled it out and opened it.

Arthur Weasley 



BLOOD STATUS: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle leanings. Known member of 
the Order of the Phoenix 

FAMILY: Wife (pureblood), seven children, two youngest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest 
son currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have 
confirmed. 

SECURITY STATUS: TRACKED. All movements are being 
monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will 
contact (has stayed with Weasley family previously) 

��Undesirable Number One,�� Harry muttered under his breath as he replaced Mr. Weasley��s 
folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he 
straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places he saw a poster of himself on 
the wall, with the words UNDESIRABLE NO. 1 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note 
was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and saw that 
Umbridge had written, ��To be punished.�� 

Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried 
flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the office one last 
sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small 
rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk. 

Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized that the moment he touched it 
that it was not a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy 
book. Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat �C The Life and Lies 
of Albus Dumbledore �C nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest, ��by Rita Skeeter, 
bestselling author of Armando Dippet, Master or Moron?�� 

Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys, both

��182ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

laughing immoderately with their arms around each other��s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with 
elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum��s chin that had so 
annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild 
look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a 
young Doge, but before he could check the caption, the door of the office opened. 

If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had 
time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have 
caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he remained quite still, staring 
curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps deciding that that all he had seen 
was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily replaced it 
upon the shelf. Thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing 
ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly 
daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond. 

The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy Detonator, which 
continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, ��I 
bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they��re so careless, remember that poisonous 
duck?�� 

Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never been likely that the 
locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of 
Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to be to leave the 
Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another day. The first thing to do was to find 
Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom. 

The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak as it 
started its descent. To his enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and 
wild-eyed Ron got in.

 ��M-morning,�� he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again.

 ��Ron, it��s me, Harry!��

 ��Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like �C why isn��t Hermione with you?��

 ��She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn��t refuse, and �C�� 

But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again. The doors opened and Mr. Weasley

��183ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased (pull hair away from scalp 

and comb towards the head in order to make hair look thicker) so high it resembled an anthill.

 ��... I quite understand what you��re saying, Wakanda, but I��m afraid I cannot be party to �C�� 

Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have Mr. Weasley glare at 
him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once 
more. 

��Oh hello, Reg,�� said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady dripping from Ron��s 
robes. ��Isn��t your wife in for questioning today? Er �C what��s happened to you? Why are you so 
wet?�� 

��Yaxley��s office is raining,�� said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley��s shoulder, and Harry felt 
sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each other��s 
eyes. ��I couldn��t stop it, so they��ve sent me to get Bernie �C Pillsworth, I think they said �C�� 

��Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,�� said Mr. Weasley. ��Did you try Meterolojinx 

Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.��

 ��Meteolojinx Recanto?�� whispered Ron. ��No, I didn��t. Thanks, D �C I mean, thanks, Arthur.�� 

The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left, and Ron darted past her out of 
sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, 
his nose buried in some papers he was reading. 

Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lift with his father. He 
glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened 
again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. 
Weasley��s arm.

 ��One moment, Runcorn.��

 The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weasley said, ��I hear you had 
information about Dirk Cresswell.�� 

Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley��s anger was no less because of the brush with 
Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid. 

 ��Sorry?�� he said. 

 ��Don��t pretend, Runcorn,�� said Mr. Weasley fiercely. ��You tracked down the wizard who faked 

his family tree, didn��t you?��

��184ҳ��

��I �C so what if I did?�� said Harry. 

��So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,�� said Mr. Weasley quietly, as the lift sank 
ever lower. ��And if he survives Azkaban, you��ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, 
his sons, and his friends -��

 ��Arthur,�� Harry interrupted, ��you know you��re being tracked, don��t you?��

 ��Is that a threat, Runcorn?�� said Mr. Weasley loudly.

 ��No,�� said Harry, ��it��s a fact! They��re watching your every move �C�� 

The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave Harry a scathing look 
and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he was impersonating somebody 
other than Runcorn. The lift doors clanged shut. 

Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try to extricate Hermione 
on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining office. When the doors opened, he stepped out 
into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the wood-paneled and carpeted corridors 
above. As the lift rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door 
that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries. 

He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on the left hand 
side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. His mind grappled with 
possibilities as he crept down them. He still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it 
would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick 
word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important to get 
away with this, and even if he managed it, Hermione��s non-reappearance might trigger a search 
before they were clear of the Ministry. 

Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him, 
as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took; a 
cold that reached right down his throat and tore at his lungs. And then he felt that stealing sense of 
despair, or hopelessness, filling him, expanding inside him. 

Dementors, he thought. 

And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene. The dark 
passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black-hooded figures, their faces completely 
hidden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petrified Muggle-borns brought in

��185ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their 
faces in their hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors�� 
greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by families, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding 
up and down in front of them, and the cold, the hopelessness and the despair of the place laid 
themselves upon Harry like a curse. 

Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here without 
revealing himself instantly. So he moved forward as silently as he could, and with every step he 
took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of 
Ron, who needed him. 

Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying. The eyeless faces hidden beneath 
their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human 
presence that still had some hope, some resilience. 

And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon doors on the left 
of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it. 

"No, no, I��m half-blood, I��m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard, he was, look him 
up, Arkie Alderton, he��s a well known broomstick designer, look him up, I tell you �C get your 
hands off me, get your hands off �C" 

��This is your final warning,�� said Umbridge��s soft voice, magically magnified so that it 
sounded clearly over the man��s desperate screams. ��If you struggle, you will be subjected to the 
Dementor��s Kiss.��

 The man��s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor. 

 ��Take him away,�� said Umbridge. 

Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting, scabbed hands 
clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting. They glided away down the 
corridor with him, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight.

 ��Next �C Mary Cattermole,�� called Umbridge. 

A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot. Her dark hair was smoothed 
back into a bun and she wore long plain robes. Her face was completely bloodless. As she passed 
the dementors, Harry saw her shudder. 

He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her walking alone

��186ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

into the dungeon. As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her. 

It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic. 
This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic�ıտ�
��֢ sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well. 

There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; they stood like 
faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade��
��, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, quite as white-faced as Mrs. 
Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform, a bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up 
and down, up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was there to protect the 
prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors. 

That was for the accused to feel, not the accusers. 

��Sit down,�� said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice. 

Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised 
platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her 

there. 

��You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?�� asked Umbridge. 

Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod. 

��Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department?�� 

Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears. ��I don��t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!�� 

Umbridge ignored her. ��Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?�� 

Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever. ��They��re frightened, they think I might not come 

home -��

 ��Spare us,�� spat Yaxley. ��The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies.�� 

Mrs. Cattermole��s sobs masked Harry��s footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps 
that led up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat 
patrolled, he felt the change in temperature. It was warm and comfortable here. The Patronus, he 
was sure, was Umbridge��s, and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here, in her element, 
upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. 

Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and 
Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making Hermione jump. He

��187ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word 
might cause Hermione alarm. 

Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance.

 ��I��m behind you,�� he whispered into Hermione��s ear. 

As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which 
she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating 
upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed. 

��A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole,�� 
Umbridge was saying. ��Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you 
recognize the description?��

 Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve.

 ��Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?�� 

��T-took?�� sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. ��I didn��t t-take it from anybody. I b-bought it when I was 
eleven years old. It �C it �C it �C chose me.��

 She cried harder than ever. 

Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She leaned forward 
over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold swung forward too, and 
dangled over the void, the locket. 

Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still intent upon 
their prey, were deaf to everything else. 

��No,�� said Umbridge, ��no, I don��t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose witches or 
wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here �C 
Mafalda, pass them to me.�� 

Umbridge held out a small hand. She looked so toadlike at that moment that Harry was quite 
surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermione��s hands were shaking with shock. 
She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf 
of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole��s name on it. 

��That��s �C that��s pretty, Dolores,�� she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds 
of Umbridge��s blouse. 

��What?�� snapped Umbridge, glancing down. ��Oh yes �C an old family heirloom,�� she said,

��188ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

patting the locket lying on her large bosom. ��The S stands for Selwyn. I am related to the Selwyns. 
Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related. A pity,�� she continued in a 
louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole��s questionnaire, ��that the same cannot be said for 
you. 'Parents' professions, greengrocers'.�� 

Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the dementors 
stood waiting in the corners. 

It was Umbridge��s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry��s brain and obliterated his 
sense of caution �C that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to 
bolster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed 
beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, ��Stupefy!�� 

There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the 
balustrade, Mrs. Cattermole��s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, down below, the prowling 
silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind. Yaxley, confused, looked around 
for the source of the trouble and saw Harry��s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried 
to draw his own wand, but too late, ��Stupefy!��

 Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. 

 ��Harry!��

 ��Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend �C��

 ��Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!�� 

Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the dementors had 
moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair, Whether 
because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in 
control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear 
as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back. 

��EXPECTO PATRONUM!�� 

The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry��s wand and leaped toward the dementors, which 
fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stag��s light, more powerful and more 
warming than the cat��s protection, filled the whole dungeon as it cantered around the room.

 ��Get the Horcrux,�� Harry told Hermione. 

He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak into his back, and approached Mrs.

��189ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cattermole. 

��You?�� she whispered, gazing into his face. ��But �C but Reg said you were the one who 
submitted my name for questioning!�� 

��Did I?�� muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms, ��Well, I��ve had a change of 
heart. Diffindo!�� 

Nothing happened. ��Hermione, how do I get rid of these chains?�� 

��Wait, I��m trying something up here �C��

 ��Hermione, we��re surrounded by dementors!�� 

��I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket��s gone �C I need to duplicate it �C 
Geminio! There... That should fool her... .��

 Hermione came running downstairs. 

 ��Let��s see... . Relashio!�� 

The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Cattermole looked just as 

frightened as ever before. 

 ��I don��t understand,�� she whispered. 

��You��re going to leave here with us,�� said Harry, pulling her to her feet. ��Go home, grab your 
children, and get out, get out of the country if you��ve got to. Disguise yourselves and run. You��ve 
seen how it is, you won��t get anything like a fair hearing here.�� 

��Harry,�� said Hermione, ��how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside 
the door?�� 

��Patronuses,�� said Harry, pointing his wand at his own. The stag slowed and walked, still 
gleaming brightly, toward the door. ��As many as we can muster; do yours, Hermione.��

 ��Expec �C Expecto patronum,�� said Hermione. Nothing happened. 

��It��s the only spell she ever has trouble with,�� Harry told a completely bemused Mrs. 
Cattermole. ��Bit unfortunate, really... Come on Hermione... .�� 

"Expecto patronum!" 

A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione��s wand and swam gracefully through the air to 

join the stag. 

 ��C��mon,�� said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door. 

When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people

��190ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

waiting outside. Harry looked around; the dementors were falling back on both sides of them, 
melding (blend, merge) into the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures. 

��It��s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families,�� Harry 
told the waiting Muggle-born, who were dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering 
slightly. ��Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That��s the �C er �C new official 
position. Now, if you��ll just follow the Patronuses, you��ll be able to leave the Atrium.�� 

They managed to get up the stone stops without being intercepted, but as they approached the 
lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, and otter 
soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not 
help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this unwelcome 
conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them. 

��Reg!�� screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into Ron��s arms. ��Runcorn let me out, 
he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he��s told all of us to leave the country. I think we��d better 
do it, Reg, I really do, let��s hurry home and fetch the children and �C why are you so wet?�� 

��Water,�� muttered Ron, disengaging himself. ��Harry, they know there are intruders inside the 
Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge��s office door. I reckon we��ve got five minutes if 
that �C��

 Hermione��s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to Harry.

 ��Harry, if we��re trapped here �C!�� 

��We won��t be if we move fast,�� said Harry. He addressed the silent group behind them, who 
were all gawping at him.

 ��Who��s got wands?��

 About half of them raised their hands. 

��Okay, all of you who haven��t got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has. We��ll 
need to be fast before they stop us. Come on.�� 

They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry��s Patronus stood sentinel before the 
golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise. 

 ��Level eight,�� said the witch��s cool voice, ��Atrium.�� 

Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people moving from 

fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off. 

��191ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Harry!�� squeaked Hermione. ��What are we going to �C?�� 

��STOP!�� Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the Atrium, The 
wizards sealing the fireplaces froze. ��Follow me,�� he whispered to the group of terrified Muggleborns, 
who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and Hermione. 

��What��s up, Albert?�� said the same balding wizard who had followed Harry out of the fireplace 
earlier. He looked nervous. 

��This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,�� said Harry with all the authority he could 
muster.

 The group of wizards in front of him looked at one another.

 ��We��ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone �C�� 

��Are you contradicting me?�� Harry blustered. ��Would you like me to have your family tree 
examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell��s?�� 

��Sorry!�� gasped the balding wizard, backing away. ��I didn��t mean nothing, Albert, but I 
thought... I thought they were in for questioning and...�� 

��Their blood is pure,�� said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall. 
��Purer than many of yours, I daresay. Off you go,�� he boomed to the Muggle-borns, who scurried 
forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some 
looking confused, others scared and fearful. Then:

 ��Mary!�� 

Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer vomiting but 
pale and wan, had just come running out of a lift.

 ��R- Reg?��

 She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.

 The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other. 

 ��Hey �C what��s going on? What is this?��

 ��Seal the exit! SEAL IT!�� 

Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces, 
into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard 
lifted his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, sending him flying through the 
air.

��192ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He��s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!�� Harry shouted. 

The balding wizard��s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. 
Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked 
from Harry to the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed, ��My wife! Who was 
that with my wife? What��s going on?��

 Harry saw Yaxley��s head turn, saw an inkling of truth dawn on that brutish face. 

��Come on!�� Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace 
together as Yaxley��s curse sailed over Harry��s head. They spun for a few seconds before shooting 
up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door, Ron was standing there beside the 
sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole.

 ��Reg, I don��t understand �C��

 ��Let go, I��m not your husband, you��ve got to go home!��

 There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around; Yaxley had just appeared. 

��LET��S GO!�� Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on 
the stop. 

Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing hands, but something was 
wrong. Hermione��s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip. 

He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not breathe or see and the only solid 
things in the world were Ron��s arm and Hermione��s fingers, which were slowly slipping away. 

And then he saw the door to number twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent door knocker, 
but before he could draw breath, there was a scream and a flash of purple light, Hermione��s hand 
was suddenly vise-like upon his and everything went dark again.

Chapter Fourteen 

The Thief 

Harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by 


gold and 
green; he had no idea what had happened, he 

only knew 
that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves 

and twigs. 
Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt 

flattened, he 
blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was 

sunlight 
streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face. He 
pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small, fierce creature, but saw that 
the object was Ron��s foot. Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a 
forest floor, apparently alone. 

Harry��s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though he knew how 
foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at 
the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid��s hut. However, in the few moments it took for 
Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the 
Forbidden Forest; The trees looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer. 

He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron��s head. The moment his eyes fell upon 
Ron, all other concerns fled Harry��s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron��s left side and his 
face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off 
now, Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and 
redder as his face drained of the little color it had left.

 ��What��s happened to him?�� 

��Splinched,�� said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron��s sleeve, where the blood was 
wettest and darkest. 

Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron��s short. He had always thought of Splinching as 
something comical, but this ... His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron��s upper 
arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife. 

 ��Harry, quickly, in my bag, there��s a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany'�C��

 ��Bag �C right �C��

��194ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his 
hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his touch, He felt the leather 
spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes �C 

��Quickly!��

 He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag. 

��Accio Dittany!�� 

A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened back to Hermione and 
Ron, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white eyeball were all that were visible between 
his lids. 

��He��s fainted,�� said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda, 
though her hair was still gray in places. ��Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.�� 

Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle. Hermione took it and poured three drops of the 
potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry 
saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched 
over what had just been open flesh. 

 ��Wow,�� said Harry. 

��It��s all I feel safe doing,�� said Hermione shakily. ��There are spells that would put him 
completely right, but I daren��t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage... He��s lost so 
much blood already... �� 

��How did he get hurt? I mean�� �C Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make sense of 
whatever had just taken place �C ��why are we here? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld 
Place?��

 Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears.

 ��Harry, I don��t think we��re going to be able to go back there.��

 ��What d��you �C?�� 

��As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn��t get rid of him, he was too 
strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then �C well, I think 
he must have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so he slackened his grip and I 
managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead!�� 

��But then, where��s he? Hang on... You don��t mean he��s at Grimmauld Place? He can��t get in

��195ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

there?��

 Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded. 

��Harry, I think he can. I �C I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but I��d already taken 
him inside the Fidelius Charm��s protection. Since Dumbledore died, we��re Secret-Keepers, so I��ve 
given him the secret, haven��t I?�� 

There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could 
now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing 
other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had 
been their one safe refuge; even, now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of 
home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the house-elf 
busying himself over the steak-and-kidney pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat.

 ��Harry, I��m sorry, I��m so sorry!��

 ��Don��t be stupid, it wasn��t your fault! If anything, it was mine... �� 

Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye��s eye. Hermione recoiled, looking 
horrified. 

��Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn��t leave it there ... but 
that��s how they knew there were intruders.�� 

Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his eyes. He was still gray and his 
face glistened with sweat.

 ��How d��you feel?�� Hermione whispered. 

 ��Lousy,�� croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. ��Where are we?�� 

��In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,�� said Hermione. ��I wanted 
somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was �C�� 

���C the first place you thought of,�� Harry finished for her, glancing around at the apparently 
deserted glade�ּ�յ� grassy clearing in forest). He could not help remembering what had 
happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of �C how Death 
Eaters had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his henchmen 
know, even now, where Hermione had taken them? 

��D��you reckon we should move on?�� Ron asked Harry, and Harry could tell by the look on 
Ron��s face that he was thinking the same.

��196ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I dunno.�� 

Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he 
was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting. 

��Let��s stay here for now,�� Harry said. 

 Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet.

 ��Where are you going?�� asked Ron. 

��If we��re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,�� she replied, 
and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring 
incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air. It was as if Hermione 
had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. 

��Salvio Hexia ... Protego Totalum ... Repello Muggletum ... Muffliato ... You could get out the 

tent, Harry.��

 ��Tent?��

 ��In the bag!��

 ��In the ... of course,�� said Harry. 

He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. The tent 
emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, ropes, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the 
smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup. 

��I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?�� he asked, starting to disentangle 
the pent pegs. 

��Apparently he didn��t want it back, his lumbago's��ʹ so bad,�� said Hermione, now 
performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand. ��so Ron��s dad said I could 
borrow it. Erecto!�� she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one fluid 
motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before Harry, out of whose 
startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope (���� a cable, 
wire, or rope that is used to brace something (especially a tent). 

��Cave Inimicum,�� Hermione finished with a skyward flourish. ��That��s as much as I can do. At 

the very least, we should know they��re coming; I can��t guarantee it will keep out Vol �C��

 ��Don��t say the name!�� Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. 

 Harry and Hermione looked at each other.

��I��m sorry,�� Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, ��but it feels like a �C 

a jinx or something. Can��t we call him You-Know-Who �C please?��

 ��Dumbledore said fear of a name �C�� began Harry. 

��In case you hadn��t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn��t do Dumbledore 
much good in the end,�� Ron snapped back. ��Just �C just show You-Know-Who some respect, will 
you?�� 

��Respect?�� Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he was not to 
argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition. 

Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent. The 
interior was exactly as Harry remembered it; a small flat, complete with bathroom and tiny 
kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a 
bunk��ʽ���� bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had 
settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while. 

��I��ll make some tea,�� said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of 
her bag and heading toward the kitchen. 

Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that Mad-Eye had 
died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. 

After a minute or two, Ron broke the silence. ��What d��you reckon happened to the 
Cattermoles?�� 

��With any luck, they��ll have got away,�� said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for comfort. ��As 
long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he��ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by SideAlong-
Apparition and they��ll be fleeing the country right now with their children. That��s what 
Harry told her to do.�� 

��Blimey, I hope they escaped,�� said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea seemed to be 
doing him good; a little of his color had returned. ��I didn��t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all 
that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they 
made it... If they both end up in Azkaban because of us ...�� 

Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask �C about whether Mrs. 
Cattermole��s lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband �C died in his 
throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such

��198ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing 

him.

 ��So, have you got it?�� Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there.

 ��Got �C got what?�� she said with a little start.

 ��What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where��s the locket?�� 

��You got it?�� shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows. ��No one tells me 
anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!�� 

��Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren��t we?�� said Hermione. 
��Here.��

 And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron. 

It was as large as a chicken��s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green stones, 
glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent��s canvas roof. 

��There isn��t any chance someone��s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?�� asked Ron hopefully. ��I 
mean, are we sure it��s still a Horcrux?��

 ��I think so,�� said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. ��There��d be some 
sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.�� 

She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked perfect, pristine. He 
remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the Horcrux ring had been 
cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it. 

��I reckon Kreacher��s right,�� said Harry. ��We��re going to have to work out how to open this 
thing before we can destroy it.�� 

Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit 
Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket 
from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with his fingers, then 
attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus��s bedroom door. Neither worked. He 
handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were no more 
successful at opening it than he had been. 

��Can you feel it, though?�� Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his clenched fist. 

��What d��you mean?�� 

Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry.

��199ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing 
through his veins that he could feel, or was it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal 
heart?

 ��What are we going to do with it?�� Hermione asked. 

��Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it.�� Harry replied, and, little though he wanted to, 
he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it 
rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him. 

��I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,�� he added to Hermione, 
standing up and stretching. ��And we��ll need to think about some food as well. You stay there,�� he 
added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green.

 With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in 
the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However, the 
Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective 
enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people 
rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and 
squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at 
ten o��clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across 
the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing. 

He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had not packed any food in her magical 
bag, as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had 
had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the 
nearest trees and stewed in a Billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion 
away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as to not hurt Hermione��s feelings. 

The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs, 
Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, yet he kept his wand held tight 
at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery 
mushrooms, tingled with unease. 

He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but 
somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a 
tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he had been hurtling toward

��200ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt halt, run out of 
road. 

There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest idea where 
they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. Meanwhile he was at a loss to know 
how to destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that currently lay against the bare 
flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it 
might just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, 
that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own. Nameless forebodings 
crept upon him as he sat there in the dark. He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came 
at him relentlessly. Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking 
softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to. He could not. And it seemed to 
Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his 
chest was ticking away the time he had left... Stupid idea, he told himself, don��t think that... 

His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was making it happen by having 
these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another channel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who 
had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would the elf keep silent or would he 
tell the Death Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed 
towards him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? 
What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry��s head and he tried to 
push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher. He and Hermione had 
already decided against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They 
could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to 
Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione��s sleeve. 

Harry��s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they did not know, Lupin 
had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. Why hadn��t Dumbledore 
explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he would live for years, for 
centuries perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong. Snape had seen to 
that... Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower ... 

 And Dumbledore had fallen ... fallen ...

��Give it to me, Gregorovitch.�� 

Harry��s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by a long-fingered white 
hand. The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were 
no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his limbs wrapped about him, 
his terrified face, on a level with Harry��s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head. He 
had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard, a trussed��, ��-up Father Christmas.

 ��I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen from me!��

 ��Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows... He always knows.�� 

The hanging man��s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and 
bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole �C 

And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch��s wake as he 
held a lantern aloft, Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern 
illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of 
light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair. 
In the split second that the lantern��s light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his 
handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward 
out of the window with a crow of laughter. 

And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils and Gregorovitch��s face was 

stricken with terror.

 ��Who was the thief, Gregorovitch?�� said the high cold voice.

 ��I do not know, I never knew, a young man �C no �C please �C PLEASE!��

 A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light - 

��Harry!�� 

He opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had passed out against the side of the 
tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. He looked up at 
Hermione, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high 
above them. 

��Dream,�� he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet Hermione��s glower with a look of 
innocence. ��Must��ve dozed off, sorry.��

 ��I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were looking into Vol �C��

��Don��t say his name!�� came Ron��s angry voice from the depths of the tent.

 ��Fine,�� retorted Hermione, ��You-Know-Who��s mind, then!�� 

��I didn��t mean it to happen!�� Harry said. ��It was a dream! Can you control what you dream 
about, Hermione?��

 ��If you just learned to apply Occlumency �C��

 But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to discuss what he had just seen. 

��He��s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he��s killed him, but before he killed him he 
read Gregorovitch��s mind and I saw �C�� 

��I think I��d better take over the watch if you��re so tired you��re falling sleep,�� said Hermione 
coldly.

 ��I can finish the watch!��

 ��No, you��re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.�� 

She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing to avoid a 

row, Harry ducked back inside. 

Ron��s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the one above 
him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After several moments, Ron spoke in a 
voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the entrance.

 ��What��s You-Know-Who doing?�� 

Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered into the 
darkness. 

 ��He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.�� 

��How��s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he��s tied up?��

 ��I dunno... It��s weird, isn��t it?�� 

Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all that he had seen and heard. The more he recalled, the less 
sense it made... Voldemort had said nothing about Harry��s wand, nothing about the twin cores, 
nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat Harry��s.

 ��He wanted something from Gregorovitch,�� Harry said, eyes still closed tight. ��He asked him to 
hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him ... and then ... then ...�� 

He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle through Gregorovitch��s eyes, into 
his memories.

��203ҳ��

��He read Gregorovitch��s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill, and he 
fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he stole whatever You-KnowWho��s 
after. And I ... I think I��ve seen him somewhere... ��

 Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy��s face. The theft had happened 
many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look familiar? 

The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all Harry could hear was 
Ron��s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, ��Couldn��t you see what the thief was holding?��

 ��No ... it must��ve been something small.��

 ��Harry?��

 The wooden slats of Ron��s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed. 

 ��Harry, you don��t reckon You-Know-Who��s after something else to turn into a Horcrux?�� 

��I don��t know,�� said Harry slowly. ��Maybe. But wouldn��t it be dangerous for him to make 

another one? Didn��t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?��

 ��Yeah, but maybe he doesn��t know that.��

 ��Yeah ... maybe,�� said Harry. 

He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin 
cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker ... and yet he had killed him, 
apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore. 

What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the Wizarding world 
at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object that Gregorovitch had once owned, 
and which had been stolen by the unknown thief? 

Harry could still see the blond-haired youth��s face; it was merry, wild; there was a Fred and 
George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him. He had soared from the windowsill like a bird, 
and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. 

With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and it was on 
him that Harry��s thoughts dwelled, as Ron��s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he 
himself drifted slowly into sleep once more.

Chapter Fifteen 
The Goblin��s Revenge 


Early next morning, before the other two were 
left the tent to search the woods around them for 
gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. 
shadows he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and 
by gouging a small cross in the bark with his

awake, Harry 
the oldest, most 
There in its

wand. It was 
have much 
Umbridge's 

door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going 
to do next. 

Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with 
the sole provison that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione 
therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron 
obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. 
Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town. 

Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copseС��ľ�� of trees and surrounded 
it with freshly cast defensive enchantments. Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find 
sustenance (food). This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an 
unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he 
stood. 

"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent 
empty handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors. 

 "I couldn't ... make one." he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. "Wouldn't ... come." 

Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a 
nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, 
as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he was not 
going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry's willpower to uproot himself from the 
spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went. 

 "So we still haven't got any food." 

"Shut up, Ron," snapped Hermione. "Harry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn't 

make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!"

 "I don't know." 

He sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was 
afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago. Today he 
might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express. 

Ron kicked a chair leg. "What?" he snarled at Hermione. "I'm starving! All I've had since I bled 
half to death is a couple of toadstools!"

 "You go and fight your way through the dementors, then," said Harry, stung. 

 "I would, but my arm's in a sling, in case you hadn't noticed!"

 "That's convenient."

 "And what's that supposed to -?" 

"Of course!" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into 
silence. "Harry, give me the locket! Come on," she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him 
when he did not react, "the Horcrux, Harry, you're still wearing it!" 

She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The moment it parted 
contact with Harry's skin he felt free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy 
or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted.

 "Better?" asked Hermione.

 "Yeah, loads better!" 

"Harry," she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated 
with visiting the very sick, "you don't think you've been possessed, do you?" 

"What? No!" he said defensively, "I remember everything we've done while I've bee wearing it. 
I wouldn't know what I'd done if I'd been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times 
when she couldn't remember anything." 

"Hmm," said Hermione, looking down at the heavy locket. "Well, maybe we ought not to wear 
it. We can just keep it in the tent." 

"We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around," Harry stated firmly. "If we lose it, if it gets

��206ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

stolen -" 

 "Oh, all right, all right," said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out 
of sight down the front of her shirt. "But we'll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too 
long."

 "Great," said Ron irritably, "and now we've sorted that out, can we please get some food?" 

"Fine, but we'll go somewhere else to find it," said Hermione with half a glance at Harry. 
"There's no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around." 

In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung�㲼�� (spread over a large area) field 
belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread. 

"It's not stealing, is it?" asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs 
on toast. "Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?"

 Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, "Er-my-nee, 'oo worry 'oo much. 'Elax!" 

And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed. The argument 
about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as 
he took the first of the three night watches. 

This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits, an empty one, 
bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near 
starvation at the Dursleys��. Hermione bore up���� 
reasonably well on those nights when they 
managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than 
usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a 
day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both 
unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron's turn to wear the Horcrux, 
he became downright unpleasant. 

"So where next?" was his constant refrain��ͷ�� 
. He did not seem to have any ideas himself, 
but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded (sulk) over the 
low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where 
they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they already got, their 
conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they got no new information. 

As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places 
important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that

��207ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised; Hogwarts, 
where he had been educated; Borgin and Burks, where he had worked after completing school; 
then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile. These formed the basis of their speculations. 

"Yeah, let's go to Albania. Shouldn't take more than an afternoon to search an entire country," 
said Ron sarcastically. 

"There can't be anything there. He'd already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into 
exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth," said Hermione. "We know the snake's 
not in Albania, it's usually with Vol��"

 "Didn't I ask you to stop say that?"

 "Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who, happy?"

 "Not particularly." 

"I can't see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes." said Harry, who had made this point 
many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. "Borgin and Burke were 
experts at Dark objects, they would've recognized a Horcrux straightaway." 

Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Harry plowed on, 
"I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts." 

 Hermione sighed. "But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!"

 Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory. 

"Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwart's secrets. I'm 

telling you, if there was one place Vol��" 

 "Oi!" 

"YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!" Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. "If there was one place 

that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!" 

 "Oh, come on," scoffed Ron. "His school?" 

"Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special, it meant 
everything to him, and even after he left -" 

 "This is You-Know-Who we're talking about, right? Not you?" inquired Ron. He was tugging at 
the chain of the Horcrux around his neck; Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him. 

"You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left," said 
Hermione.

��208ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"That's right," said Harry. 

"And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably 
another founder's object, to make into another Horcrux?" 

 ��Yeah,�� said Harry. 

��But he didn��t get the job, did he?�� said Hermione. ��So he never got the chance to find a 

founder��s object there and hide it in the school!��

 ��Okay, then,�� said Harry, defeated. ��Forget Hogwarts.�� 

Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, 
search for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and 
discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before. They visited 
its site and found a tower block of offices. 

 ��We could try digging in to foundations?�� Hermione suggested halfheartedly. 

��He wouldn��t have hidden a Horcrux here,�� Harry said. He had known it all along. The 
orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have 
hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or 
mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could 
imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding banks, with its 
gilded doors and marble floors. 

Even without any new idea, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent 
in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed 
all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by 
Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered 
mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly coveС���� 
. Every twelve hours or so they passed 
the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of passthe-
parcel, where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of 
increased fear and anxiety. 

Harry��s scare kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was wearing the 

Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain. 

 ��What? What did you see?�� demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince. 

 ��A face,�� muttered Harry, every time. ��The same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.��

��209ҳ��

And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron 
was hoping to hear news of his family or the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, 
Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not 
tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown 
youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no 
better than he did. As Harry��s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam 
tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other 
two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, 
when they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes. 

As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having 
conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry 
entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads 
together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them 
and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water. 

Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a 
pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn 
in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that 
Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further 
Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of 
the others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it. 

Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it. They were now pitching the tent 
on mulches (spread leaves or straw around plants) of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast 
by the dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better 
at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack 
of other people��s company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against 
Voldemort. 

��My mother,�� said Ron on night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, ��can make 
good food appear out of thin air.��

He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. Harry glanced automatically 
at Ron��s neck and saw, as he has expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He 
managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve 
slightly when the time came to take off the locket. 

��Your mother can��t produce food out of thin air,�� said Hermione. ��No one can. Food is the first 

of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp��s Law of Elemental Transfigura -��

 ��Oh, speak English, can��t you?�� Ron said, prising a fish out from between his teeth. 

��It��s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, 

you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you��ve already got some -��

 ��Well, don��t bother increasing this, it��s disgusting,�� said Ron. 

��Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I��m always the one who ends up 

sorting out the food, because I��m a girl, I suppose!��

 ��No, it��s because you��re supposed to be the best at magic!�� shot back Ron. 

 Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike���ƹ������ 
slid off her tin plate onto the floor. 

��You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them 

into something worth eating, and I��ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see you -��

 ��Shut up!�� said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. ��Shut up now!��

 Hermione looked outraged. ��How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook -��

 ��Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!�� 

He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and 

gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It 

was not moving.

 ��You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?�� he whispered to Hermione. 

��I did everything,�� she whispered back, ��Muffliato, Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment 

Charms, all of it. They shouldn��t be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.�� 

Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, told them 
that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow 
bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had 
cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the 
notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their

��211ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time. 

The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Harry 
estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it 
impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a 
moment she drew out three Extendible Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily 
inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent 
entrance.

 Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice. 

��There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d��you reckon it��s too early in the season? Accio 
Salmon!�� 

There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. 
Somebody grunted appreciatively. 

Harry pressed the Extendable ear deeper into his own. Over the murmur of the river he could 
make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever 
heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there 
seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other. 

A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas, large shadows passed between tent and 
flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the 
clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.

 ��Here, Griphook, Gornuk.��

 Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. 

 ��Thank you,�� said the goblins together in English. 

��So, you three have been on the run how long?�� asked a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it 
was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man. 

��Six weeks ... Seven ... I forget,�� said the tired man. ��Met up with Griphook in the first couple 
of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.�� There was a 
pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. 
��What made you leave, Ted?�� continued the man. 

��Knew they were coming for me,�� replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who 
he was, Tonks��s father. ��Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I��d better run

for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, 
knew I��d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she��s pure-blood. And then I met Dean 
here, what, a few days ago, son?�� 

��Yeah,�� said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but 
besides themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow 
Gryffindor.

 ��Muggle-born, eh?�� asked the first man. 

��Not sure,�� said Dean. ��My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I��ve got no proof he was a 
wizard, though.��

 There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching, then Ted spoke again. 

��I��ve got to say, Dirk, I��m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was that 

you��d been caught.�� 

��I was,�� said Dirk. ��I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it. Stunned Dawlish, 
and nicked his broom. It was easier than you��d think; I don��t reckon he��s quite right at the moment. 
Might be Confunded. If so, I��d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably 
saved my life.�� 

There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on. The Ted said, ��And 
where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the 
whole.�� 

��You had a false impression,�� said the higher-voiced of the goblins. ��We take no sides. This is 

a wizards�� war.��

 ��How come you��re in hiding, then?�� 

��I deemed it prudent,�� said the deeper-voiced goblin. ��Having refused what I considered an 

impertinent request, I could see that my personal safety was in jeopardy.��

 ��What did they ask you to do?�� asked Ted. 

��Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,�� replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less 

human as he said it. ��I am not a house-elf.��

 ��What about you, Griphook?�� 

��Similar reasons,�� said the higher voiced goblin. ��Gringotts is no longer under the sole control 

of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master.��

��213ҳ��

He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk laughed.

 ��What��s the joke?�� asked Dean. 

 ��He said,�� replied Dirk, ��that there are things wizards don��t recognize, either.��

 There was a short pause. 

 ��I don��t get it,�� said Dean.

 ��I had my small revenge before I left,�� said Griphook in English. 

��Good man -goblin, I should say,�� amended Ted hastily. ��Didn��t manage to lock a Death Eater 
up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?�� 

��If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,�� replied Griphook. Gornuk laughed 

again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle.

 ��Dean and I are still missing something here,�� said Ted. 

��So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,�� said Griphook, and the two goblins roared 
with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry��s breathing was shallow with excitement, He and 
Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could. 

��Didn��t you hear about that, Ted?�� asked Dirk. ��About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor��s 
sword out of Snape��s office at Hogwarts?�� 

An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted 
to the spot. 

 ��Never heard a word,�� said Ted, ��Not in the Prophet, was it?�� 

��Hardly,�� chortled Dirk. ��Griphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill Weasley who 
works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill��s younger sister.�� 

Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as 
tightly as lifelines. 

��She and a couple of friends got into Snape��s office and smashed open the glass case where he 
was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the 
staircase.�� 

��Ah, God bless 'em,�� said Ted. ��What did they think, that they��d be able to use the sword on 
You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself? 

��Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn��t 
safe where it was,�� said Dirk. ��Couple of days later, once he��d got the say-so (approval) from You


��214ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.��

 The goblins started to laugh again.

 ��I��m still not seeing the joke,�� said Ted.

 ��It��s a fake,�� rasped Griphook.

 ��The sword of Gryffindor!�� 

��Oh yes. It is a copy -an excellent copy, it is true -but it was Wizard-made. The original was 

forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. 

Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank.��

 ��I see,�� said Ted. ��And I take it you didn��t bother telling the Death Eaters this?�� 

��I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,�� said Griphook smugly, and now Ted 

and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk��s laughter. 

Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question he needed answered, 
and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged, he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-
boyfriend of Ginny��s too.

 ��What happened to Ginny and all the others? The ones who tried to steal it?��

 ��Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,�� said Griphook indifferently. 

��They��re okay, though?�� asked Ted quickly, ��I mean, the Weasleys don��t need any more of 
their kids injured, do they?��

 ��They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,�� said Griphook. 

��Lucky for them,�� said Ted. ��With Snape��s track record I suppose we should just be glad 
they��re still alive.�� 

��You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?�� asked Dirk.�� You believe Snape killed 
Dumbledore? 

��'Course I do,�� said Ted. ��You��re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had 
anything to do with it?��

 ��Hard to know what to believe these days,�� muttered Dirk. 

��I know Harry Potter,�� said Dean. ��And I reckon he��s the real thing -the Chosen One, or 
whatever you want to call it.�� 

��Yeah, there��s a lot would like to believe he��s that, son,�� said Dirk, ��me included. But where is 
he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You��d think if he knew anything we don��t, or had anything

special going for him, he��d be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And 
you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against him -�� 

��The Prophet?�� scoffed Ted. ��You deserve to be lied to if you��re still reading that much, Dirk. 
You want the facts, try the Quibbler.�� 

There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal of thumping, by the 
sound of it. Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he sputtered, ��The Quibbler? That lunatic rag 
of Xeno Lovegood��s?�� 

��It��s not so lunatic these days,�� said Ted. ��You want to give it a look, Xeno is printing all the 
stuff the Prophet��s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. 
How long they��ll let him get with it, mind, I don��t know. But Xeno says, front page of every issue, 
that any wizard who��s against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-
one priority.��

 ��Hard to help a boy who��s vanished off the face of the earth,�� said Dirk. 

��Listen, the fact that they haven��t caught him yet��s one hell of an achievement,�� said Ted. ��I��d 
take tips from him gladly; it��s what we��re trying to do, stay free, isn��t it?�� 

��Yeah, well, you��ve got a point there,�� said Dirk heavily. ��With the whole of the Ministry and 
all their informers looking for him, I��d have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who��s to say 
they haven��t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?��

 ��Ah, don��t say that, Dirk,�� murmured Ted. 

There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they spoke again 
it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. 
Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up 
the incline, their voices fading away. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found the need to 
remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say 
more then, ��Ginny - the sword -��

 ��I know!�� said Hermione.

 She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit. 

��Here ... we ... are ...�� she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was 
evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight.

��216ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of Hermione��s 
bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment. 

��If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledore��s office,�� she 
panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, ��Phineas Nigellus would have 
seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!�� 

��Unless he was asleep,�� said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front 

of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said, 

 ��Er��Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?��

 Nothing happened. 

��Phineas Nigellus?�� said Hermione again. ��Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? 

Please?��

 ��'Please' always helps,�� said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. 

At once, Hermione cried, ��Obscura!�� 

A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus��s clever, dark eyes, causing him to bump into 

the frame and shriek with pain. 

 ��What - how dare - what are you -?��

 ��I��m very sorry, Professor Black,�� said Hermione, ��but it��s a necessary precaution!�� 

��Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! 
Where am I? What is going on?�� 

��Never mind where we are,�� said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, abandoning his attempts to 
peel off the painted blindfold.

 ��Can that possible be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?�� 

��Maybe,�� said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus��s interest. ��We��ve got a 
couple of questions to ask you - about the sword of Gryffindor.�� 

��Ah,�� said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight 
of Harry, ��yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there -��

 ��Shut up about my sister,�� said Ron roughly, Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows.

 ��Who else is here?�� he asked, turning his head from side to side. ��Your tone displeases me! The 
girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster.��

 ��They weren��t thieving,�� said Harry. ��That sword isn��t Snape��s.��

��217ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It belongs to Professor Snape��s school,�� said Phineas Nigellus. ��Exactly what claim did the 
Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the 
Lovegood oddity!��

 ��Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!�� said Hermione. 

��Where am I?�� repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. ��Where 
have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?��

 ��Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?�� asked Harry urgently.

 ��Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.��

 ��Hagrid��s not an oaf!�� said Hermione shrilly. 

��And Snape might��ve though that was a punishment,�� said Harry, ��buy Ginny, Neville, and 

Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest ... they��ve faced plenty worse 

than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!��

 He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at the very least. 

��What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, taken out 

the sword at all? Maybe it��s been taken away for cleaning... or something!��

 Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered. 

��Muggle-born,�� he said, ��Goblin-made armor does not require cleaning, simple girl. Goblin��s 

silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.��

 ��Don��t call Hermione simple,�� said Harry. 

��I grow weary of contradiction,�� said Phineas Nigellus. ��Perhaps it is time for me to return to 
the headmaster��s office.��

 Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out of his picture 
and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration.

 ��Dumbledore! Can��t you bring us Dumbledore?��

 ��I beg your pardon?�� asked Phineas Nigellus. 

 ��Professor Dumbledore��s portrait��couldn��t you bring him along, here, into yours?��

 Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry��s voice. 

��Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The portraits of Hogwarts may 
commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside of the castle except to visit a painting of 
themselves elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me, and after the treatment I have

��218ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

received at your hands, I can assure you that I will not be making a return visit!��

 Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame. 

��Professor Black,�� said Hermione, ��couldn��t you just tell us, please, when was the last time the 

sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean?��

 Phineas snorted impatiently. 

��I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor 
Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.�� 

Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in front of Phineas 
Nigellus, who had at last managed to locate the exit. 

��Well, good night to you,�� he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again. 
Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout. 

 ��Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?��

 Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture. 

��Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many eccentricities of Albus 

Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!��

 And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop. 

 ��Harry!�� Hermione cried. 

��I know!�� Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he 
had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did 
not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing��ѹ 
Phineas Nigellus��s back into the 
beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to 
Harry. 

��The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthens 
them - Harry, that sword��s impregnated (saturate, imbue) with basilisk venom!�� 

��And Dumbledore didn��t give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the 
locket -��

 ��- and he must have realized they wouldn��t let you have it if he put it in his will -��

 ��- so he made a copy -��

 ��- and put a fake in the glass case -��

 ��- and he left the real one - where?��

��219ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

They gazed at east other. Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above 
them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn��t Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but 
Harry had not realized it at the time?

 ��Think!�� whispered Hermione. ��Think! Where would he have left it?��

 ��Not at Hogwarts,�� said Harry, resuming his pacing.

 ��Somewhere in Hogsmeade?�� suggested Hermione.

 ��The Shrieking Shack?�� said Harry. ��Nobody ever goes in there.��

 ��But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn��t that be a bit risky?��

 ��Dumbledore trusted Snape,�� Harry reminded her. 

 ��Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,�� said Hermione. 

��Yeah, you��re right!�� said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the thought that Dumbledore 
had had some reservations, however faint, about Snape��s trustworthiness. ��So, would he have 
hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d��you reckon, Ron? Ron?�� 

Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left the tent, then 
realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a bunk, looking stony.

 ��Oh, remembered me, have you?�� he said. 

 ��What?��

 Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk. 

 ��You two carry on. Don��t let me spoil your fun.�� 

Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, apparently as 

nonplussed as he was. 

 ��What��s the problem?�� asked Harry. 

��Problem? There��s no problem,�� said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. ��Not according to 

you, anyways.��

 There were several plunks�������� 
on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain. 

 ��Well, you��ve obviously got a problem,�� said Harry. ��Spit it out, will you?��

 Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike himself. 

��All right, I��ll spit it out. Don��t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there��s some 
other damn thing we��ve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you don��t know.��

 ��I don��t know?�� repeated Harry. ��I don��t know?��

��220ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank 
all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry��s jubilation; 
Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking. 

��It��s not like I��m not having the time of my life here,�� said Ron, ��you know, with my arm 
mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after 
we��d been running round a few weeks, we��d have achieved something.�� 

��Ron,�� Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it 

over the loud tattoo�����н�����û��� the rain was beating on the tent.

 ��I thought you knew what you��d signed up for,�� said Harry.

 ��Yeah, I thought I did too.�� 

��So what part of it isn��t living up to your expectations?�� asked Harry. Anger was coming to his 
defense now. ��Did you think we��d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other 
day? Did you think you��d be back to Mummy by Christmas?�� 

��We thought you knew what you were doing!�� shouted Ron, standing up, and his words pierced 
Harry like scalding knives. ��We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had 
a real plan!�� 

��Ron!�� said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but 
again, he ignored her. 

��Well, sorry to let you down,�� said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, 
inadequate. ��I��ve been straight with you from the start. I told you everything Dumbledore told me. 
And in the case you haven��t noticed, we��ve found one Horcrux -�� 

��Yeah, and we��re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them -nowhere 
effing near in other words.�� 

��Take off the locket, Ron,�� Hermione said, her voice unusually high. ��Please take it off. You 
wouldn��t be talking like this if you hadn��t been wearing it all day.�� 

��Yeah, he would,�� said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. ��D��you think I haven��t 
noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D��you think I didn��t guess you were thinking 
this stuff?

 ��Harry, we weren��t -�� 

��Don��t lie!�� Ron hurled at her. ��You said it too, you said you were disappointed, you said

��221ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

you��d thought he had a bit more to go on than -��

 ��I didn��t say it like that - Harry, I didn��t!�� she cried. 

The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione��s face, and the excitement 
of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared 
and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they knew 
not where, and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be 
dead.

 ��So why are you still here?�� Harry asked Ron. 

��Search me,�� said Ron. 

 ��Go home then,�� said Harry. 

��Yeah, maybe I will!�� shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back 
away. ��Didn��t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don��t give a rat��s fart, do you, it��s 
only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I��ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn��t care what happened to her in 
there - well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff -��

 ��I was only saying - she was with the others, they were with Hagrid -�� 

��Yeah, I get it, you don��t care! And what about the rest of my family, 'the Weasleys don��t need 
another kid injured,' did you hear that?�� 

��Yeah, I -��

 ��Not bothered what it meant, though?��

 ��Ron!�� said Hermione, forcing her way between them. ��I don��t think it means anything new has 
happened, anything we don��t know about; think, Ron, Bill��s already scarred, plenty of people must 
have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you��re supposed to be on your deathbed with 
spattergroit, I��m sure that��s all he meant -�� 

��Oh, you��re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won��t bother myself about them. It��s all right for 

you, isn��t it, with your parents safely out of the way -��

 ��My parents are dead!�� Harry bellowed.

 ��And mine could be going the same way!�� yelled Ron. 

��Then GO!�� roared Harry. ��Go back to them, pretend you��ve got over your spattergroit and 
Mummy��ll be able to feed you up and -�� 

Ron made a sudden movement, Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner��s

pocket, Hermione had raised her own. 

��Prestego!�� she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side 
and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, 
and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing 
each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron, Something had 
broken between them.

 ��Leave the Horcrux,�� Harry said. 

Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to 
Hermione.

 ��What are you doing?��

 ��What do you mean?��

 ��Are you staying, or what?�� 

��I ...�� She looked anguished. ��Yes -yes, I��m staying. Ron, we said we��d go with Harry, we said 

we��d help -��

 ��I get it. You choose him.��

 ��Ron, no �C please - come back, come back!�� 

She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed it he had already 

stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron��s 

name amongst the trees.

 After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face.

 ��He��s g-g-gone! Disapparated!��

 She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry. 

Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his own neck. He 
dragged blankets off Ron��s bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own 
bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.

turning his 
bunk. It was 
eyes. Harry 
eyes averted 

from Ron's. Hermione, who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but 
turned her face away quickly as he went by. 

He's gone, Harry told himself. He's gone. He had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed as 
though repetition would dull the shock of it. He's gone and he's not coming back. And that was the 
simple truth of it, Harry knew, because their protective enchantments meant that it would be 
impossible, once they vacated this spot, for Ron to find them again. 

He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione's eyes were puffy and red�ֺ����� 
; she 
looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why 
she wanted to spin out���ӳ� 
their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, 
and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy 
rain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked 
around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, 
another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, "We thought you knew 
what you were doing!", and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach. 

The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank. They 
had lingered a good���� hour after they would usually have departed their campsite. Finally 
having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable to find any more 
reasons to delay. She and Harry gasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept 
heatherʯ�ϻ�-covered hillside. 

The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry's hand and walked away from him, finally

��224ҳ��

sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He 
watched her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the 
spot. Everything inside him felt cold and tight. Again he saw the contemptuous expression on 
Ron's face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught 
Hermione at its center, casting the spell she usually performed to ensure their protection. 

They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to mention 
his name again and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although 
sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry 
had started bringing out the Marauder's map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for 
the moment when Ron's labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he 
had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not 
appear on the map and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny's 
name in the girl's dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might 
break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was 
all right. 

By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of Gryffindor's 
sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the 
more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry 
could not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something. 
There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. 
We thought you knew what you were doing ... We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do ... 
We thought you had a real plan! 

He could not hide it from himself, Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him with virtually 
nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it. The others 
were as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to engulf him. He was 
staggered (shocked) now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends' offers to 
accompany him on this meandering���� 
, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and 
he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indications that Hermione too was about to tell 
him that she had had enough, that she was leaving.

They were spending many evenings in near silence and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas 
Nigellus's portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left 
by Ron's departure. Despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas 
Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to and 
consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was even glad to see him, because 
he was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind. They relished any news about what was 
happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, 
the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful 
not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave 
his painting. 

However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, low level of 
mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape 
had reinstated Umbridge's old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any 
unofficial student societies. From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably 
Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumbledore's Army. This 
scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him 
think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as 
his ex-girlfriend. Indeed, as Phineas Niggellus talked about Snape's crackdown��ѹ 
, Harry 
experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the 
destabilization of Snape��s regime. Being fed and having a soft bed and other people being in 
charge seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at this moment. But then he remembered 
that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand Galleon price on his head, and 
that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. 
Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about 
Harry and Hermione��s whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time 
he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these 
unceremonious good-byes. 

The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any area too long, so rather 
than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they

continued to meander up and down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet pounded the 
tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle 
of a Scottish loch (Scottish) lake, where snow half buried the tent in the night. 

They had already spotted Christmas Trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before 
there came an evening when Harry resolved to suggest again, what seemed to him the only 
unexplored avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal, Hermione had been 
to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as 
she left), and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of 
spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. 

He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours�� break from wearing the 

Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him.

 ��Hermione?�� 

��Hmm?�� She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The Tales of Beedle the Bard. 
He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, which was not, after all, very 
long, but evidently she was still deciphering something in it, because Spellman��s Syllabary lay 
open on the arm of the chair. 

Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several years 
previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, 
despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip. 

 ��Hermione, I��ve been thinking, and �C��

 ��Harry, could you help me with something?�� 

Apparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and held out The Tales of 
Beedle the Bard. 

��Look at that symbol,�� she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry assumed was 
the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what 
looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.

 ��I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.�� 

��I know that; but it isn��t a rune and it��s not in the syllabary, either. All along I thought it was a 
picture of an eye, but I don��t think it is! It��s been inked in, look, somebody��s drawn it there, it isn��t 
really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?��

��227ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No ... No, wait a moment.�� Harry looked closer. ��Isn��t it the same symbol Luna��s dad was 
wearing round his neck?�� 
��Well, that��s what I thought too!�� 
��Then it��s Grindelwald��s mark.��

 She stared at him, openmouthed. ��What?�� 

��Krum told me ...�� 

He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding. 

Hermione looked astonished. ��Grindelwald��s mark?�� 

She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. ��I��ve never heard that Grindelwald 
had a mark. There��s no mention of it in anything I��ve ever read about him.�� 
��Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durmstrang, and 
Grindelwald put it there.�� 
She fell back into the old armchair, frowning. 
��That��s very odd. If it��s a symbol of Dark Magic, what��s it doing in a book of children��s 
stories?�� 
��Yeah, it is weird,�� said Harry. ��And you��d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was 
Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.�� 
��I know. Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories have little pictures 
over the titles.�� She did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. 

Harry tried again. ��Hermione?��

 ��Hmm?��

 ��I��ve been thinking. I �C I want to go to Godric��s Hollow.��

 She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was sure she was still thinking about 
the mysterious mark on the book. 

 ��Yes,�� she said. ��Yes, I��ve been wondering that too. I really think we��ll have to.��

 ��Did you hear me right?�� he asked. 

��Of course I did. You want to go to Godric��s Hollow. I agree. I think we should. I mean, I can��t 
think of anywhere else it could be either. It��ll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more 
likely it seems it��s there.�� 

��Er �C what��s there?�� asked Harry.

��228ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt. 
��Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you��d want to go back there, and I 
mean, Godric��s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor��s birthplace �C�� 
��Really? Gryffindor came from Godric��s Hollow?�� 
��Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?�� 
��Erm,�� he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months. The muscles in his face felt 
oddly stiff. ��I might��ve opened it, you know, when I bought it ... just the once... �� 
��Well, as the village is named after him, I��d have thought you might have made the 
connection,�� said Hermione. 

She sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late; Harry half expected her to 
announce that she was off to the library. ��There��s a bit about the village in A History of Magic, 
wait ...�� 

She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally extracting her copy of their old 
school textbook A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through (go through 
something quickly) until finding the page she wanted. 

����Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding 
for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small communities within a 
community. Many small villages and hamlets��small village��attracted several magical families, 
who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworsh in Cornwall, 
Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable 
homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded 
Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric��s Hollow, the 
West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman 
Wright, Wizarding smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of 
ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have 
dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.�� 

��You and your parents aren��t mentioned.�� Hermione said, closing the book, ��because Professor 
Bagshot doesn��t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric��s 
Hollow, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor��s sword; don��t you think Dumbledore would have expected 
you to make the connection?��

��229ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Oh yeah ...�� 

Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he 
suggested they go to Godric��s Hollow. For him, the lure of the village lay in his parents�� graves, 
the house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot. 

 ��Remember what Muriel said?�� he asked eventually.

 ��Who?�� 

��You know,�� he hesitated. He did not want to say Ron��s name. ��Ginny��s great-aunt. At the 
wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.�� 

��Oh,�� said Hermione. It was a sticky moment, Harry knew that she had sensed Ron��s name in 

the offing (�ڸ����������Ҫ���Ƶ�). He rushed on:

 ��She said Bathilda Bagshot still lived in Godric��s Hollow.�� 

��Bathilda Bagshot,�� murmured Hermione, running her index finger over Bathilda��s embossed

ʹ������� name on the front cover of A History of Magic. ��Well, I suppose �C�� 

She gasped so dramatically that Harry��s insides turned over; he drew his wand, looking around 
at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there 
was nothing there. 

��What?�� he said, half angry, half relieved. ��What did you do that for? I thought you��d seen a 

Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least �C��

 ��Harry, what if Bathilda��s got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her?�� 

Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now, and 
according to Muriel, she was ��gaga.�� Was it likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword 
of Gryffindor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance, 
Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much as 
mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt on 
Hermione��s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with (agree with) Harry��s 
dearest wish. 

 ��Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric��s Hollow?�� 

��Yes, but we��ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.�� She was sitting up now, and Harry 
could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. ��We��ll need 
to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a start, and perhaps

��230ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think we should go the whole hog����
�ɣ��ɵ��� 
and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we��ll need to collect hair from somebody. I 
actually think we��d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the better.�� 

Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause, but his mind had left the 
conversation. For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he 
felt excited. 

He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family. It was in 
Godric��s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday. 
He could have invited friends to his house... He might even have had brothers and sisters... It 
would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had 
hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place 
where it had been taken from him. 

After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from 
Hermione��s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long 
ago. For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up 
at him from the images, which were all he had left of them now. 

Harry would gladly have set out for Godric��s Hollow the following day, but Hermione had 
other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his 
parents�� deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they 
had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later �C once they had surreptitiously 
obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had practiced 
Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together �C that Hermione 
agreed to make the journey. 

They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when 
they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle 
man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag containing all of their 
possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into 
an inside pocket of Hermione��s buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, 
then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again.

��231ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing hand in hand in a snowy 
lane under a dark blue sky, in which the night��s first stars were already glimmering feebly. 
Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their 
windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the 
village. 

��All this snow!�� Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. ��Why didn��t we think of snow? After 
all our precautions, we��ll leave prints! We��ll just have to get rid of them �C you go in front, I��ll do it 
�C�� 

Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves 
concealed while magically covering their traces.

 ��Let��s take off the Cloak,�� said Harry, and when she looked frightened, ��Oh, come on, we don��t 
look like us and there��s no one around.�� 

He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered, the icy air 
stinging their faces as they passed more cottages. Any one of them might have been the one in 
which James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, 
their snow-burdened roofs, and their front porches, wondering whether he remembered any of 
them, knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little more than a year old when 
he had left this place forever. He was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at 
all; he did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little 
lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, 
was revealed to them. 

Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle, 
partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and 
a little church whose stained-glass windows��ɫ������ 
were glowing jewel-bright across the 
square. 

The snow here had become impactedѹ����. It was hard and slippery where people had 
trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them, their figures briefly illuminated 
by streetlamps. They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; 
then they heard a carol start up inside the little church. 

 ��Harry, I think it��s Christmas Eve!�� said Hermione.

��232ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Is it?��

 He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks. 

��I��m sure it is,�� said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. ��They ... they��ll be in there, won��t 
they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.�� 

Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like fear. Now that he was so 
near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, 
because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling him forward. Halfway 
across the square, however, she stopped dead.

 ��Harry, look!�� 

She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had transformed. Instead of an 
obelisk����ʯ�� 
covered in names, there was a statue of three people, a man with untidy hair and 
glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother��s 
arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps. 

Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents�� faces. He had never imagined that there would be 
a statue... How strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on 
his forehead... 

��C'mon,�� said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again toward the church. As 
they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war 
memorial. 

The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harry��s throat constrict, it 
reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside 
suits of armor, of the Great Hall��s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had 
won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater... 

 There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it open as quietly as 
possible and they edged�����ƶ� 
through it. On either side of the slippery path to the church 
doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carving deep trenches 
behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant 
windows. 

Behind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue 
that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass

��233ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket, Harry moved 

toward the nearest grave. 

 ��Look at this, it��s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of Hannah��s!��

 ��Keep your voice down,�� Hermione begged him. 

They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the snow behind 

them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then squinting into the 

surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied.

 ��Harry, here!�� 

Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his heart positively 

banging in his chest.

 ��Is it �C?��

 ��No, but look!�� 

She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the frozen, lichen��̦޺ 
spotted 
granite, the words Kendra Dumbledore and, a short way down her dates of birth and death, 
and Her Daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation: 

Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 

So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The Dumbledore family had 
indeed lived here, and part of it had died here. 

Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking that he and 
Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, 
yet he had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a 
moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of 
how much it would have meant to him. But it seemed that, to Dumbledore, the fact that their 
families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, 
perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do. 

Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow. He read 
the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. He did not 
understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest member of

��234ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the family once his mother had died. 

 ��Are you sure he never mentioned �C?�� Hermione began. 

��No,�� said Harry curtly, then, ��let��s keep looking,�� and he turned away, wishing he had not 
seen the stone, He did not want his excited trepidation�־� 
tainted with resentment. 

��Here!�� cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness. ��Oh no, sorry! I 
thought it said Potter.��

 She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on her face.

 ��Harry, come back a moment.�� 

He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way back through the 

snow toward her. 

 ��What?�� 

��Look at this!�� The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make out 

the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it. 

 ��Harry, that��s the mark in the book!�� 

He peered at the place she indicated. The stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what 

was engraved there, though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible 

name.

 ��Yeah ... it could be... ��

 Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone. 

��It says Ig �C Ignotus, I think... �� 

��I��m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?�� Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, 
and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave. 

Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had met at Hogwarts. 
Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family represented in the 
graveyard. Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or the current members had 
moved away from Godric��s Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and every 
time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation. 

The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper. Harry looked 
around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the carols had finished, that the chatter 
and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square.

Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights. 

Then Hermione��s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and clear from a few 
yards away.

 ��Harry, they��re here ... right here.�� 

And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time, He moved toward her, 
feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest, the same sensation he had had right after 
Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs. 

The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana��s. It was made of white marble, 
just like Dumbledore��s tomb, and this made it easy to read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry 
did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it. 

JAMES POTTER LILY POTTER 
BORN 27 MARCH 1960 BORN 30 JANUARY 1960 
DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 


The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. 

Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to take in their 
meaning, and he read the last of them aloud. 

��'The last enemy that shall be defeated is death'.�� A horrible thought came to him, and with a 
kind of panic. ��Isn��t that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there?�� 

��It doesn��t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry,�� said Hermione, 
her voice gentle. ��It means ... you know ... living beyond death. Living after death.�� 

But they were not living, thought Harry. They were gone. The empty words could not disguise 
the fact that his parents�� moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. 
And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what 
was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, 
looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James 
lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart 
still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was 
sleeping under the snow with them.

Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He could not look at her, but 
returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying 
to regain control. He should have brought something to give them, and he had not thought of it, 
and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it 
in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them. Harry caught it 
and laid it on his parents�� grave. 

As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave. He did not think he could stand another moment 
there. He put his arm around Hermione��s shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they 
turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore��s mother and sister, back 
toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.

Chapter Seventeen 
Bathilda��s Secret 



"Harry, stop." 

"What's wrong?" 

They had only just reached the grave of the 


unknown 
Abbott. 
"There's someone there. Someone watching us. I 

can tell. There, 
over by the bushes." 
They stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense black boundary of the 

graveyard. Harry could not see anything. 

"Are you sure?" 

"I saw something move. I could have sworn I did...�� 

She broke from him to free her wand arm. 

"We look like Muggles," Harry pointed out. 

"Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave? Harry, I'm sure there's 

someone over there!" 

Harry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be haunted; what if -? But 
then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy���� 
of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione 
had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow. 

"It's a cat," said Harry, after a second or two, "or a bird. If it was a Death Eater we'd be dead by 
now. But let's get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on." 

They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. Harry, who did not 
feel as sanguine�ֹ۵�as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate 
and the slippery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves. The pub was 
fuller than before. Many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they 
approached the church. 

For a moment, Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say 
anything Hermione murmured, "Let's go this way," and pulled him down the dark street leading 
out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the

��238ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They walked as 
quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the outlines of 
Christmas trees dark through the curtains. 

"How are we going to find Bathilda's house?" asked Hermione, who was shivering a little and 
kept glancing back over her shoulder. "Harry? What do you think? Harry?" 

She tugged at this arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking toward the dark 
mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he sped up, dragging 
Hermione along with him, she slipped a little on the ice. 

"Harry -" 

"Look ... Look at it, Hermione ...�� 

"I don't ... oh!" 

He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had grown 
wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst 
the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in the dark ivy 
and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where 
the curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must 
once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it. 

"I wonder why nobody's ever rebuilt it?" whispered Hermione. 

"Maybe you can't rebuild it." Harry replied. "Maybe it's like the injuries from Dark Magic and 
you can't repair the damage." 

He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, not 
wishing to open it, but simply to hold some part of the house. 

"You're not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might - oh, Harry, look!" 

His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the ground in front of 
them, up thorough the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in 
golden letters upon the wood it said: 

On this spot, on this night of 31 October 1981, 
Lily and James Potter lost their lives. 
Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard


��239ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

ever to have survived the Killing Curse. 
This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left 
in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters 
and as a reminder of the violence 
that tore apart their family. 


And all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added by other witches and 
wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived had escaped. Some had merely 
signed their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into the wood, still others had 
left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen years' worth of magical 
graffiti, all said similar things. 

Good luck, Harry, wherever you are. 
If you read this, Harry, we're all behind you! 
Long live Harry Potter. 


"They shouldn't have written on the sign!" said Hermione, indignant. 

But Harry beamed at her. 

"It's brilliant. I'm glad they did. I ...�� 

He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted by the 
bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the figure was a 
woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground. Her stoop, 
her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as 
she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was 
passing, but he knew instinctively that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from 
them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them. 

He did not need Hermione's pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that this woman was 
a Muggle, She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to 
her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however, it was odd behavior to 
come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, 
meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the 
strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they were. Just as he had

��240ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

reached this uneasy conclusion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned. 

Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against his. 

"How does she know?" 

He shook his head. 

The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey 
the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that 
they stood facing each other in the deserted street. Was it possible that she had been waiting for 
them all these long months? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in 
the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had 
followed them to this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power 
that he had never encountered before. Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump. 

"Are you Bathilda?" 

The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again. 

Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry raised his eyebrows; 
Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod. They stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and 
hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. 
They followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just 
left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let 
them pass. 

She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house; Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her 
and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down 
with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue 
and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry's face. Her eyes were thick 
with cataracts������ 
and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with 
broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if she 
could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see. 

The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as she unwound a 
moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed 
clearly. 

"Bathilda?" Harry repeated.

��241ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it that 
sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, 
could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near? Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing 
Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting 
room. 

"Harry, I'm not sure about this," breathed Hermione. 

"Look at the size of her, I think we could overpower her if we had to," said Harry. "Listen, I 
should have told you, I knew she wasn't all there. Muriel called her 'gaga'." 

"Come!" called Bathilda from the next room. 

Hermione jumped and clutched Harry's arm. 

"It's okay," said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room. 

Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was still very dark, not to 
mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry's nose detected, 
underneath the dank��ʪ�� and mildewed��ù 
smell, something worse, like meat gone bad. He 
wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda's house to check whether she 
was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for she lit the candles 
clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire. 

"Let me do that," offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She stood watching him as 
he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously 
on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups. 

The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-frontedǰ���ǹ��ε� chest of 
drawers�嶷�� 
;�¹�on which there stood a large number of photographs. When the flame danced 
into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from 
the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered "Tergeo". The dust vanished 
from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most 
ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed them. Then the sight 
of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up. 

It was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had perched on Gregorovitch's 
windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where 
he had seen the boy before, in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage

��242ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs were, in Rita's book. 

"Mrs. - Miss - Bagshot?" he said, and his voice shook slightly. "Who is this?" 

Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for her. 

"Miss Bagshot?" Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the flames 

burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux beat faster upon his 

chest. 

"Who is this person?" Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward. 

She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry. 

"Do you know who this is?" he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual. "This 
man? Do you know him? What's he called?" 

Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had Rita Skeeter unlocked 
Bathilda's memories? 

"Who is this man?" he repeated loudly. 

"Harry, what area you doing?" asked Hermione. 

"This picture. Hermione, it's the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!" he said to 

Bathilda. "Who is this?" 

But she only stared at him. 

"Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. -Miss -Bagshot?" asked Hermione, raising her 
own voice. "Was there something you wanted to tell us?" 

Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to Harry. 
With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall. 

"You want us to leave?" he asked. 

She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at herself, then at the ceiling. 

"Oh, right... Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her." 

"All right," said Hermione, "let's go." 

But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor, once more pointing 
first at Harry, then to herself. "She wants me to go with her, alone." 

"Why?" asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room, the old 
lady shook her head a little at the loud noise. 

"Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?"

��243ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Do you really think she knows who you are?" 

"Yes," said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own. "I think she does." 

"Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry." 

"Lead the way," Harry told Bathilda. 

She seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him toward the door. Harry glanced 
back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; she stood hugging 
herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase. As Harry walked out of 
the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he slipped the silver-framed photograph of the 
unknown thief inside his jacket. 

The stairs were steep and narrow; Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout Bathilda's 
backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too 
likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, turned immediately right, and 
led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom. 

It was pitch-black and smelled horrible, Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from 
under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness. 

"Lumos," said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start, Bathilda had moved close to him in 
those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her approach. 

"You are Potter?" she whispered. 

"Yes, I am." 

She nodded slowly, solemnly. 

Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than his own heart. It was an unpleasant, agitating 

sensation. 

"Have you got anything for me?" Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-tip. 

"Have you got anything for me?" he repeated. 

Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once, Harry's scar prickled painfully; 
the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved 
momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice, Hold him! 

Harry swayed where he stood. The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around him again; 
he did not know what had just happened. 

"Have you got anything for me?" he asked for a third time, much louder. 

��244ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Over here," she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the outline of 
a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window. 

This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade bed, his wand raised. 
He did not want to look away from her. 

"What is it?" he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what 
looked and smelled like dirty laundryҪϴ���·�. 

"There," she said, pointing at the shapeless mass. 

And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, 
she moved weirdly. He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror 
paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and a great snake pouring from the place where 
her neck had been. The snake struck as he raised his wand. The force of the bite to his forearm sent 
the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was 
extinguished; Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him, He 
fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing. 

He rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake's tail, which thrashed down upon the table 
where he had been a second earlier. Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the 
floor. From below he heard Hermione call, "Harry?" 

He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back, Then a heavy smooth mass smashed 

him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular... 

"No!" he gasped, pinned to the floor. 

"Yes," whispered the voice. "Yesss... hold you ... hold you ...�� 

"Accio ... Accio Wand ...�� 

But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled 
itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a 
circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his brain was flooding 
with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, distant footsteps, 
everything going... 

A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying, flying with triumph in his 
heart, without need of broomstick or thestral... 

He was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He scrambled

��245ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light. It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a 
shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered. Frozen air filled the room as 
Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like 
something - his wand. 

He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione 
was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang 
and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking Harry hard in the face as it went, 
coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared 
more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years. 

"He's coming! Hermione, he's coming!" 

As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos. It smashed shelves from the 
wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark 
shape he knew to be Hermione. 

She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed, The snake reared again, but Harry 
knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to 
split open with the pain from his scar. 

The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, 
Hermione screamed, "Confringo!" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe 
mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear 
the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt from bed to 
broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness, her scream 
reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair ... 

And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid 
bedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the 
little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled with the girl's, 
that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in Christmas Day... 

And his scream was Harry's scream, his pain was Harry's pain... that it could happen here, where 
it had happened before... here, within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing 
what it was to die ... to die ... the pain was so terrible ... ripped from his body ... But if he had no 
body, why did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how cold he feel so unbearably, didn't pain

cease with death, didn't it go ... 

The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square and the 
shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a world in which they 
did not believe ... And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him 
that he always knew on these occasions ... Not anger ... that was for weaker souls than he ... but 
triumph, yes ... He had waited for this, he had hoped for it ... 

"Nice costume, mister!" 

He saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, 
saw the fear cloud his painted face. Then the child turned and ran away ... Beneath the robe he 
fingered the handle of his wand ... One simple movement and the child would never reach his 
mother ... but unnecessary, quite unnecessary... 

And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, the 
Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet ... And he made less noise than the dead 
leaves, slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, and steered over it ... 

They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall 
black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the 
amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. 

The child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist ... 

A door opened and the mother entered, saying words he could not hear, her long dark-red hair 
falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother. He threw 
his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning... 

The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear. His white hand 
pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open... 

He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he had 
not even picked up his wand ... 

"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!" Hold him off, without a wand in 
his hand! ... He laughed before casting the curse ... 

"Avada Kedavra!" 

The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pramӤ���� 
pushed against the wall, it

��247ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

made the banisters glow like lighting rods, and James Potter fell like a marionetteǣ��ľżwhose 
strings were cut ... 

He could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was sensible, 
she, at least, had nothing to fear ... 

He climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in ... 

She had no wand upon her either ... How stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their 

safety lay in friends, that weapons could be discarded even for moments... 

He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy 
wave of his wand ... and there she stood, the child in her arms. At the sight of him, she dropped her 
son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in shielding him 
from sight she hoped to be chosen instead ... 

"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!" 

"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now." 

"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead..." 

"This is my last warning." 

"Not Harry! Please ... have mercy���� 
... have mercy ... Not Harry! Not Harry! Please -I'll do 
anything ...�� 

"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!" 

He could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to finish them all ... 

The green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. The child had not 
cried all this time. He could stand, clutching the bars of his crib, and he looked up into the 
intruder's face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid 
beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop up any moment, laughing 
-

He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face. He wanted to see it happen, the 
destruction of this one inexplicable danger. The child began to cry. It had seen that he was not 
James. He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach (endure, tolerate) the small 
ones whining in the orphanage - 

"Avada Kedavra!" 

And then he broke. He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, not

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped screaming, but far away ... far 
away ... 

"No," he moaned. 

The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy 
... 

"No...�� 

And now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda's house, immersed in memories of his 
greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass... He looked 
down and saw something... something incredible... 

"No...�� 

"Harry, it's all right, you're all right!" 

He stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he was, the unknown thief, the 
thief he was seeking... 

"No... I dropped it... I dropped it ...�� 

"Harry, it's okay, wake up, wake up!" 

He was Harry... Harry, not Voldemort ... and the thing that was rustling was not a snake ... He 
opened his eyes. 

"Harry," Hermione whispered. "Do you feel all - all right?" 

"Yes," he lied. 

He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets. He could tell that 

it was almost dawn by the stillness and quality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. He 

was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets. 

"We got away." 

"Yes," said Hermione. "I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk. I couldn't lift 
you. You've been ... Well, you haven't been quite ...�� 

There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand. 
She had been wiping his face. 

"You've been ill," she finished. "Quite ill." 

"How long ago did we leave?" 

"Hours ago. It's nearly morning."

"And I've been... what, unconscious?" 

"Not exactly," said Hermione uncomfortably. "You've been shouting and moaning and ... 
things," she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy. What had he done? Screamed curses like 
Voldemort, cried like the baby in the crib? 

"I couldn't get the Horcrux off you," Hermione said, and he knew she wanted to change the 
subject. "It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You've got a mark; I'm sorry, I had to use a Severing 
Charm to get it away. The snake hit you too, but I've cleaned the wound and put some dittany on 
it ...�� 

He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down. There was a 
scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. He could also see the half healed 
puncture marks to his forearm. 

"Where've you put the Horcrux?" 

"In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while." 

He lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face. 

"We shouldn't have gone to Godric's Hollow. It's my fault, it's all my fault. Hermione, I'm 
sorry." 

"It's not you fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might have left the sword 

there for you." 

"Yeah, well ... we got that wrong, didn't we?" 

"What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was the snake hiding 

somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attack you?" 

"No." he said. "She was the snake ... or the snake was her ... all along." 

"W-what?" 

He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda's house on him; it made the whole thing 
horribly vivid. 

"Bathilda must've been dead a while. The snake was ... was inside her. You-Know-Who put it 
there in Godric's Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I'd go back." 

"The snake was inside her?" 

He opened his eyes again. 

Hermione looked revolted, nauseated.

"Lupin said there would be magic we'd never imagined." Harry said. "She didn't want to talk in 
front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn't realize, but of course I 
could understand her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, 
I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there ... and then ...�� 

He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda's neck, Hermione did not need to know the 

details. 

"... she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked." 

He looked down at the puncture marks. 

"It wasn't supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who came." 

If he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been worth it, all of it ... Sick at heart, he 

sat up and threw back the covers. 

"Harry, no, I'm sure you ought to rest!" 

"You're the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible. I'm fine. I'll keep watch for a 

while. Where's my wand?" 

She did not answer, she merely looked at him. 

"Where's my wand, Hermione?" 

She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes. "Harry ..." 

"Where's my wand?" 

She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him. 

The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One fragile strand of phoenix feather 
kept both pieces hanging together. The wood had splintered apart completely. Harry took it into his 
hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury. He could not think 
properly. Everything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he held out the want to Hermione. "Mend 
it. Please." 

"Harry, I don't think, when it's broken like this -" 

"Please, Hermione, try!" 

"R-Reparo." 

The dangling half of the wand resealed itself. 

Harry held it up. "Lumos!" 

The wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at Hermione.

"Expelliarmus!" 

Hermione's wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The feeble attempt at magic was 
too much for Harry's wand, which split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in 
what he was seeing ... the wand that had survived so much ... 

"Harry." Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. "I'm so, so sorry. I think it 
was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting 
Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have - must have hit -" 

"It was an accident." said Harry mechanically. He felt empty, stunned. "We'll -we'll find a way 
to repair it." 

"Harry, I don't think we're going to be able to," said Hermione, the tears trickling down her face. 
"Remember ... remember Ron? When he broke his wand, crashing the car? It was never the same 
again, he had to get a new one." 

Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who 
was dead. How was he supposed to find himself a new wand? 

"Well," he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, "well, I'll just borrow yours for now, then. 
While I keep watch." 

Her face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand, and he left her sitting beside his 
bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her.

Chapter Eighteen 

The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore 

The sun was coming up. The pure, colorless 


vastness of the 
sky stretched over him, indifferent to him and his 

suffering. Harry 
sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep 

breath of clean 
air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over 

the sparkling 
snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest 

treasure on earth, 
yet he could not appreciate it. His senses had 

been spikedʹʧ
Ч 
by the calamity of losing his wand. He looked 

out over a valley 
blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming 

through the 
glittering silence. 

Without realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying to resist 
physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count; he had lost all bones 
in his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join 
those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally 
weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of his magical power had been torn from 
him. He knew exactly what Hermione would say if he expressed any of this. The wand is only as 
good as the wizard. But she was wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like 
the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the protection of the 
twin cores, and only now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting on it. 

He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without looking at them, tucked 
them away in Hagrid��s pouch around his neck. The pouch was now too full of broken and useless 
objects to take any more. Harry��s hand brushed the old Snitch through the moleskin and for a 
moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away. Impenetrable, unhelpful, 
useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind. 

And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him inside, wiping out 
every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that 
Godric��s Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were supposed to go back, that it

��253ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

was all part of some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore, but there was no map, no plan. 
Dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of 
terrors, alone and unaided. Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, 
and now, Harry had no wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely 
be easy now for Voldemort to find out who he was ... 

Voldemort had all the information now ... 

��Harry?�� 

Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. Her face streaked with 
tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky 

under her arm. 

��Thanks,�� he said, taking one of the cups. 

��Do you mind if I talk to you?�� 

��No,�� he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings. 

��Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well ... I��ve got the book.�� 

Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. 

��Where - how -?�� 

��It was in Bathilda��s sitting room, just lying there... This note was sticking out of the top of it.�� 

Hermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud. 

��'Dear Bally, Thanks for your help. Here��s a copy of the book, hope you like it. You said 

everything, even if you don��t remember it. Rita.' I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda 

was alive, but perhaps she wasn��t in any fit state to read it.�� 

��No, she probably wasn��t.�� 

Harry looked down upon Dumbledore��s face and experienced a surge of savage pleasure. Now 
he would know all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him, whether 
Dumbledore wanted him to or not. 

��You��re still really angry at me, aren��t you?�� said Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears 
leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face. 

��No,�� he said quietly. ��No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying to get us out 
of there alive, and you were incredible. I��d be dead if you hadn��t been there to help me.�� 

He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book. Its spine was stiff; it

had clearly never been opened before. He riffled through the pages, looking for photographs. He 
came across the one he sought almost at once, the young Dumbledore and his handsome 
companion, roaring with laughter at some long-forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the 
caption. 

Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother��s death, 
With his friend Gellert Grindelwald. 


Harry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His friend Grindelwald. 
He looked sideways at Hermione, who was still contemplating the name as though she could not 
believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry. 

��Grindelwald!�� 

Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages around them for a 
recurrence of that fatal name. He soon discovered it and read greedily, but became lost. It was 
necessary to go farther back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found himself at the start of 
a chapter entitled ��The Greater Good.�� Together, he and Hermione started to read: 

Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze of 
glory -Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-
Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal-Winner for 
Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. 
Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias ��Dogbreath�� Doge, the 
dim-witted but devoted sidekick he had picked up at school. 

The two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London, preparing to 
depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived bearing news of 
Dumbledore��s mother��s death. ��Dogbreath�� Doge, who refused to be interviewed for this 
book, has given the public his own sentimental version of what happened next. He 
represents��� 
Kendra��s death as a tragic blow, and Dumbledore��s decision to give up 
his expedition as an act of noble self-sacrifice. 

Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godric��s Hollow at once, supposedly to "care" for 
his younger brother and sister. But how much care did he actually give them?

��255ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He were a head case����, that Aberforth,�� said Enid Smeek, whose family lived on 
the outskirts of Godric��s Hollow at that time. ��Ran wild. 'Course, with his mum and dad 
gone you��d have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don��t 
think Albus was fussed about him. I never saw them together, anyway.�� 

So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young brother? The answer, it 
seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. For though her first jailer had 
died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore. Her very 
existence continued to be known only to those few outsiders who, like ��Dogbreath�� 
Doge, could be counted upon to believe in the story of her "ill health". 

Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated 
magical historian who has lived in Godric��s Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course, 
had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the village. 
Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to Albus at Hogwarts, having been 
favorably impressed by his paper on trans-species transformation in Transfiguration 
Today. This initial contact led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family. At the 
time of Kendra��s death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric��s Hollow who was on 
speaking terms with Dumbledore��s mother. 

Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now 
dimmed. ��The fire��s lit, but the cauldron��s empty,�� as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in 
Enid Smeek��s slightly earthier phrase, ��She��s nutty as squirrel poo.�� Nevertheless, a 
combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough 
nuggets���� 
of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story. 

Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra��s premature death down to 
a backfiring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also 
parrots the family line on Ariana, calling her ��frail�� and ��delicate.�� On one subject, 
however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into procuring Veritaserum, for she, and 
she alone, knows the full story of the best-kept secret of Albus Dumbledore��s life. Now 
revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of 
Dumbledore, his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition into the oppression of

��256ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Muggles, even his devotion to his own family. 

The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric��s Hollow, now an 

orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her 

great-nephewֶ��, Gellert Grindelwald. 

The name of Grindelwald is justly famous. In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards 
of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a 
generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of 
terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here. 

Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the 
Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. 
Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, 
Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself no other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even 
Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to����the twisted experiments of 
Gellert Grindelwald, and he was expelled. 

Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald��s next movements is that he ��traveled 
around for some months.�� It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his 
great-aunt in Godric��s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for 
many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore. 

��He seemed a charming boy to me,�� babbles Bathilda, ��whatever he became later. 

Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own 

age. The boys took to each other at once.�� 

They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her that Albus Dumbledore sent 
Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night. 

��Yes, even after they��d spent all day in discussion -both such brilliant young boys, 
they got on like a cauldron on fire -I��d sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert��s 
bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him and he 
had to let Gellert know immediately!�� 

And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore��s fans will 

find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best 

friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.) 

��257ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Gellert - 

Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES�� OWN GOOD 
-this, I think, is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, that 
power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. 
We must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build. 
Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our 
counter-arguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it 
follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary 
and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, 
because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.) 

Albus 

Astonished and appalled though his many admirers will be, this letter constitutes proof 
that Albus Dumbledore once dreamed of overthrowing the Statute of Secrecy and 
establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. What a blow for those who have always 
portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-borns�� greatest champion! How hollow those 
speeches promoting Muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How 
despicable does Albus Dumbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when he 
should have been mourning his mother and caring for his sister! 

No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal will bleat 

that he did not, after all, put his plans into action, that he must have suffered a change of 

heart, that he came to his senses. However, the truth seems altogether more shocking. 

Barely two months into their great new friendship, Dumbledore and Grindelwald 
parted, never to see each other again until they met for their legendary duel (for more, see 
chapter 22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore come to his senses? Had 
he told Grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans? Alas, no. 

��It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,�� says Bathilda. ��It came as an 

awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he came back to my 

house all of a dither (extreme agitation or excitement), told me he wanted to go home the

��258ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

next day. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I 
saw of him. 

��Albus was beside himself at Ariana��s death. It was so dreadful for those two brothers. 
They had lost everybody except for each other. No wonder tempers ran a little high. 
Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these dreadful circumstances. 
But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus��s nose 
at the funeral was not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting 
like that, across her daughter��s body. A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the 
funeral... He would have been a comfort to Albus, at least... 

This dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few who attended Ariana 
Dumbledore��s funeral, raises several questions. Why exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore 
blame Albus for his sister��s death? Was it, as ��Batty�� pretends, a mere effusion of grief? 
Or could there have been some more concrete reason for his fury? Grindelwald, expelled 
from Durmstrang for the near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country hours 
after the girl��s death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until 
forced to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world. 

Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this brief boyhood 
friendship in later life. However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for 
some five years of turmoil, fatalities and disappearances, his attack upon Gellert 
Grindelwald. Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of exposure as his once best 
friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set 
out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met? 

And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inadvertent victim of some Dark 
rite? Did she stumble across something she ought not to have done, as the two young men 
sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? Is it possible that Ariana 
Dumbledore was the first person to die ��for the greater good��? 

The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the bottom of the page 
before him. She tugged the book out of Harry��s hands, looking a little alarmed by his expression,

��259ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something indecent. 

��Harry -�� 

But he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside him; it was exactly as he 
had felt after Ron left. He had trusted Dumbledore, believed him the embodiment of goodness and 
wisdom. All was ashes. How much more could he lose? Ron, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand ... 

��Harry.�� She seemed to have heard his thoughts. "Listen to me. It -it doesn't make a very nice 
reading -" 

"Yeah, you could say that -" 

"- but don't forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter writing." 

"You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn't you?" 

"Yes, I -I did." She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold hands. "I think that's 
the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but 'For the Greater Good' became 
Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. And ... from that ... 
it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say 'For the Greater Good' was even carved over 
the entrance to Nurmengard." 

"What's Nurmengard?" 

"The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in there himself, once 
Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it's -it��s an awful thought that Dumbledore's ideas helped 
Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita can't pretend that they knew each 
other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young, and -" 

"I thought you'd say that," said Harry. He did not want to let his anger spill out at her, but it was 
hard to keep his voice steady. "I thought you'd say 'They were young.' They were the same age as 
we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle 
with his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles." 

His temper would not remain in check much longer. He stood up and walked around, trying to 
work some of it off. 

"I'm not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote," said Hermione. "All that 'right to rule' 
rubbish, it's 'Magic Is Might' all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck 
alone in the house -" 

"Alone? He wasn't alone! He had his brother and sister for company, his Squib sister he was

��260ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

keeping locked up -" 

"I don't believe it," said Hermione. She stood up too. "Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don't 
think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, ever have allowed -" 

"The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn't want to conquer Muggles by force!" Harry 
shouted, his voice echoing across the empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose into the air, 
squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky. 

"He changed, Harry, he changed! It's as simple as that! Maybe he did believe these things when 
he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! 
Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for Muggle 
protection and Muggle born rights, who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who died 
trying to bring him down!" 

Rita's book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus Dumbledore smiled 
dolefully at both. 

"Harry, I'm sorry, but I think the real reason you're so angry is that Dumbledore never told you 
any of this himself." 

"Maybe I am!" Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his head, hardly knowing whether he 
was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. 
"Look what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don't 
expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I'm doing, trust me 
even though I don't trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!" 

His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and 

emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky. 

"He loved you," Hermione whispered. "I know he loved you." 

Harry dropped his arms. 

"I don't know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn't love, the mess he's left 
me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than 
he ever shared with me." 

Harry picked up Hermione's wand, which he had dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the 
entrance of the tent. 

"Thanks for the tea. I'll finish the watch. You get back in the warm."

��261ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

She hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the book and then walked back past 
him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. He closed 
his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true, that Dumbledore 
had really cared.

Chapter Nineteen 
The Silver Doe 


It was snowing by the time Hermione took over 


the watch at 
midnight. 
Harry's dreams were confused and disturbing: 

Nagini wove 
in and out of them, first through a gigantic, cracked 

ring, then 
through a wreath of Christmas roses. 
He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that 

somebody 
had called out to him in the distance, imagining that 

the wind 
whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices. 

Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the 
tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand. The snow was falling thickly, and she 
greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on. 

"We'll go somewhere more sheltered," she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over 
her pajamas. "I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside. I even though I saw somebody 
one or twice." 

Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, motionless 
Sneakoscope on the table. 

"I'm sure I imagined it," said Hermione, looking nervous. "The snow in the dark, it plays tricks 
on your eyes. But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?" 

Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching 
the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed them; Harry's feet parted 
company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered in 
leaves. 

"Where are we?" he asked, peering around at the fresh mass of trees as Hermione opened the 

beaded bag and began tugging out the tent poles. 

 "The Forest of Dean," she said, "I came camping here once with my mum and dad." 

Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at least 

protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around

the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was adept at producing, and which could be scooped 
up and carried in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, 
an impression reinforced by Hermione's solicitousness (concern; great care). That afternoon fresh 
flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery 
snow. 

After two nights of little sleep, Harry's senses seemed more alert than usual. Their escape from 
Godric's Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more 
threatening. As darkness drove in again Harry refused Hermione's offer to keep watch and told her 
to go to bed. 

Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters he 
owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was 
virtually impenetrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder's Map, so as to watch 
Ginny's dot for a while, before he remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she 
would be back at the Burrow. 

Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew that it must 
be full of living creatures, but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could 
separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other sinister 
movements. He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and 
at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. Their protective enchantments 
had worked for weeks; why should they break now? And yet he could no throw off the feeling that 
something was different tonight. 

Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen asleep, slumped at an 
awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness 
that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparation and Apparation. He had just 
held a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened. 

A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. Whatever the 
source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift toward him. 

He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione's wand. He screwed 
up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch black in silhouette, and still

��264ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the thing came closer. 

And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver white doe, 
moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints 
in the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-
lashed eyes held high. 

Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but her inexplicable 
familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until this 
moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for Hermione, which had been so 
strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had come 
for him, and him alone.

 They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away.

 "No," he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. "Come back!" 

She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her brightness was striped by 
their thick black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a 
trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He 
set off in pursuit. 

Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees, for 
she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked 
quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her properly. And then she 
would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know. 

At last she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward him once more, and he broke 
into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished. 

Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still imprinted on his 
retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear 
came, her presence had meant safety.

 "Lumos!" he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited. 

The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, listening to 
the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be 
attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the 
reach of the wandlight, watching him?

��265ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light burst from behind a 
tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot? 

Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but all that was there was a 
small, frozen pool, its black, cracked surface glittering as he raised his wand higher to examine it. 

He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his distorted shadow 
and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray carapace�׿� 
,��, something else 
glinted. A great silver cross... 

His heart skipped into his mouth, He dropped to his knees at the pool's edge and angled the 
wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red... It 
was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt.The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the 
forest pool. 

Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could it have come to be 
lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic 
drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of 
guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely 
because they were here? In which case, where was the person who wanted to pass it to Harry? 
Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for 
the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened (2. 
influence, change) his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the 
bottom of the frozen pool.

 He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, "Accio Sword." 

It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy the sword would have lain on 
the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, 
thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible 
danger then, and had asked for help.

 "Help," he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless. 

What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time 
he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what 
were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry's head answered him, 
Their daring nerve and chivalry set Gryffindor apart.

Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the 
frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might 
come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice. 

He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was 
going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had 
plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because 
the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting. 

With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where "chivalry" 
entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that 
he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead. 

An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was 
shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood 
there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch containing his wand, his 
mother's letter, the shard of Sirius's mirror, and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed 
Hermione's wand at the ice. 

"Diffindo." 

It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence. The surface of the pool broke and chunks of 
dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve 
the sword he would have to submerge himself completely. 

Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer. He stepped to the 
pool's edge and placed Hermione's wand on the ground still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how 
much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering, he jumped. 

Every pore of his body screamed in protest. The very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as 
he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He could hardly breathe, trembling so 
violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade with his numb feet. He 
only wanted to dive once. 

Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and shaking, 
until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage, and dived. 

The cold was agony, it attacked him like fire. His brain itself seemed to have frozen as he 
pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers

��267ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

closed around the hilt; he pulled it upward. 

Then something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water weeds, though nothing had 
brushed him as he dived, and raised his hand to free himself. It was not weed, The chain of the 
Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe. 

Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface, but merely propelled 
himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, 
his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside his head, and he 
was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around 
his chest were surely Death's. 

Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he came to 
facedown in the snow. Somewhere, close by, another person was panting and coughing and 
staggering around, Hermione had come again, as she had come when the snake attacked... 

Yet it did not sound like her, not with those deep coughs, no judging by the weight of the 
footsteps. 

Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior's identity. All he could do was raise a 
shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was 
gone. Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from over his head.

 "Are - you - mental?" 

Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry the strength to get up. 
Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but 
drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the 
Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other. 

"Why the hell," panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backward and forward on its 
shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, "didn't you take the thing off before you dived?" 

Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with Ron's 
reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still 
lying at the water's edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after sweater over his 
head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, 
and yet he had to be real. He had just dived into the pool, he had saved Harry's life. 

"It was y-you?" Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual due to his

��268ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

near-strangulation.

 "Well, yeah," said Ron, looking slightly confused. 

 "Y-you cast that doe?" 

 "What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!" 

 "My Patronus is a stag." 

 "Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers." 

Harry put Hagrid's pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater, stooped to pick up 

Hermione's wand, and faced Ron again.

 "How come you're here?" 

 Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all. 

"Well, I've -you know -I've come back. If -" He cleared his throat. "-you know, you still want 
me." 

There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron's departure seemed to rise like a wall between 
them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved Harry's life. 

Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was 
holding. 

"Oh yeah, I got it out," he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword for Harry's 
inspection. "That's why you jumped in, right?" 

 "Yeah," said Harry. "But I don't understand. How did you get here? How did you find us?" 

"Long story," said Ron. "I've been looking for you for hours, it's a big forest, isn't it? And I was 

just thinking I'd have to go kip (British) sleep) under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that 

deer coming and you following."

 "You didn't see anyone else?" 

 "No," said Ron. "I -" 

 But he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away. 

"I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because 

you'd gone in and you hadn't come up, so I wasn't going to make a detour to - hey!" 

Harry was already hurrying to the place that Ron had indicated. The two oaks grew close 
together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level, an ideal place to see 
but not be seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no

��269ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the sword and the 

Horcrux. 

 "Anything there?" Ron asked. 

 "No," said Harry.

 "So how did the sword get in that pool?" 

 "Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there." 

They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from 

Hermione's wand. 

 "You reckon this is the real one?" asked Ron. 

 "One way to find out, isn't there?" said Harry. 

The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron's hand. The locket was twitching slightly. Harry 
knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had 
tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now 
was the moment to destroy once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione's wand high, 
and saw the place, a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree. 

"Come here." he said and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock's surface, and held out 

his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head. 

 "No, you should do it." 

 "Me?" said Ron, looking shocked. "Why?"

 "Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you." 

He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he 
knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry 
something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts. 

"I'm going to open it," said Harry, "and you will stab it. Straightaway okay? Because whatever's 
in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the Diary tried to kill me."

 "How are you going to open it?" asked Ron. He looked terrified 

"I'm going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue," said Harry. The answer came so readily to his 
lips that he thought he had always known it deep down. Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter 
with Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S, inlaid with glittering green 
stones. It was easy to visualize it as a miniscule snake, curled upon the cold rock. 

��270ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"No!" said Ron. "Don't open it! I'm serious!" 

 "Why not?" asked Harry. "Let's get rid of the damn thing, it's been months -" 

 "I can't, Harry, I'm serious. You do it." 

 "But why?" 

"Because that thing's bad for me!" said Ron, backing away from the locket on the rock. "I can't 
handle it! I'm not making excuses, Harry, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affects 
you and Hermione, it made me think stuff -stuff that I was thinking anyway, but it made 
everything worse. I can't explain it, and then I'd take it off and I'd get my head straight again, and 
then I'd have to put the effing thing back on - I can't do it Harry!"

 He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head. 

 "You can do it," said Harry, "you can! You've just got the sword. I know it's supposed to be you 
who uses it. Please just get rid of it, Ron." 

The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed, then still breathing hard 
through his long nose, moved back toward the rock. 

 "Tell me when," he croaked. 

"On three," said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes, concentrating 

on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped 

cockroach. It would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry's neck still burned. 

 "One ... two ... three ... open." 

The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide open 
with a little click. 

Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom 
Riddle's eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupiled

 "Stab," said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock. 

Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands. The point dangled over the frantically swiveling 

eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from 

the empty windows. 

 Then a voice hissed from out the Horcrux. 

"I have seen your heart, and it is mine." 

 "Don't listen to it!" Harry said harshly. "Stab it!" 

��271ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you desire is 
possible, but all that you dread is also possible." 

"Stab!" shouted Harry, his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, 
and Ron gazed down into Riddle's eyes. 

"Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter ... Least loved, now, by the girl who 
prefers your friend ... Second best (2. not of the best quality), always, eternally overshadowed ...�� 

"Ron, stab it now!" Harry bellowed, He could feel the locket quivering in the grip and was 
scared of what was coming. Ron raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, Riddle's eyes 
gleamed scarlet. 

Out of the locket's two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed like two grotesque bubbles, the 
heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted. 

Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first chests, 
then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, 
swaying over Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it 
burned, suddenly, white-hot. 

"Ron!" he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with Voldemort's voice and Ron 
was gazing, mesmerized, into its face. 

"Why return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of your absence. We 
laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption -" 

"Presumption!" echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more beautiful and yet more terrible 
than the real Hermione. She swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified, yet transfixed, 
the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. "Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, 
beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What are you, 
compared with the Boy Who Lived?" 

"Ron, stab it, STAB IT!" Harry yelled, but Ron did not move. His eyes were wide, and the 
Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected in them, their hair swirling like flames, their 
eyes shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet���س�/��. 

"Your mother confessed," sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-Hermione jeered, "that she would 
have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange...�� 

"Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to

him," crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around 
Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace. Their lips met. 

On the ground in front of them, Ron's face filled with anguish. he raised the sword high, his 
arms shaking.

 "Do it, Ron!" Harry yelled.

 Ron looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes.

 "Ron -?" 

The sword flashed, plunged, Harry threw himself out of the way, there as a clang of metal and a 
long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend 
himself, but there was nothing to fight. 

The monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone. There was only Ron, standing 
there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket 
on the flat rock. 

Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do. Ron was breathing 
heavily. His eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue, they were also wet. 

Harry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced 
the glass in both windows, Riddle's eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was 
smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished, torturing Ron had been its 
final act. The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms. He 
was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, 
knelt down beside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign 
that Ron did not throw it off. 

"After you left," he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron's face was hidden, "she 
cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads of nights when 
we never even spoke to each other. With you gone...�� 

He could not finish; it was now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his 
absence had cost them. 

"She's like my sister," he went on. "I love her like a sister and I reckon that she feels the same 
way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew." 

Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his

sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron's enormous rucksack lay yards away, 
discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He hoisted it onto his own 
back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but 
otherwise composed. 

"I'm sorry," he said in a thick voice. "I'm sorry I left. I know I was a - a -" 

He looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon him 
and claim him. 

"You've sort of made up for it tonight," said Harry. "Getting the sword. Finishing off the 
Horcrux. Saving my life." 

"That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was," Ron mumbled. 

"Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was" said Harry. "I've been trying to tell you 
that for years." 

Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back of Ron's 
jacket. 

"And now," said Harry as they broke apart, "all we've got to do is find that tent again." 

But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed 
lengthy, with Ron by his side, the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry 
could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent, 
Ron lagging a little behind him. 

It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination the bluebell flames 
still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, 
and did not move until Harry had said her name several times.

 "Hermione!" 

She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face. 

"What's wrong? Harry? Are you all right?" 

"It's okay, everything's fine. More than fine, I'm great. There's someone here." 

"What do you mean? Who -?" 

She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. Harry 
backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron's rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the 
canvas.

Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale 
face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak 
hopeful smile and half raised his arms. 

Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could 

reach. 

"Ouch - ow - gerroff! What the -? Hermione - OW!" 

"You - complete - arse - Ronald - Weasley!" 

She punctuated every word with a blow, Ron backed away, shielding his head as Hermione 

advanced. 

"You - crawl - back - here - after - weeks - and - weeks - oh, where's my wand?" 

She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry's hands and he reacted instinctively. 

"Protego!" 

The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The force of it knocked her backward 

onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she lept up again. 

 "Hermione!" said Harry. "Calm -" 

"I will not calm down!" she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; she 

looked quite demented. "Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!" 

"Hermione, will you please -" 

"Don't you tell me what do, Harry Potter!" she screeched. "Don't you dare! Give it back now! 
And YOU!" 

She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation. It was like a malediction���� 
, and Harry could not 
blame Ron for retreating several steps. 

"I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back" 

"I know," Ron said, "Hermione, I'm sorry, I'm really -" 

"Oh, you're sorry!" 

She laughed a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but Harry 
merely grimaced his helplessness. 

"You came back after weeks -weeks -and you think it's all going to be all right if you just say 
sorry?" 

"Well, what else can I say?" Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back.

"Oh, I don't know!" yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. "Rack your brains, Ron, that should 

only take a couple of seconds -" 

"Hermione," interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, "he just saved my -" 

"I don't care!" she screamed. "I don't care what he's done! Weeks and weeks, we could have 

been dead for all he knew -" 

"I knew you weren't dead!" bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the first time, and 
approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them. "Harry's all over the 
Prophet, all over the radio, they're looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental 
stories, I knew I'd hear straight off if you were dead, you don't know what it's been like -" 

 "What it's been like for you?? 

Her voice was not so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a level 
of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his opportunity. 

"I wanted to come back the minute I'd Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of 
Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn't go anywhere!" 

"A gang of what?" asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her arms and 
legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for several years. 

"Snatchers," said Ron. "They're everywhere -gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up Muggleborns 
and blood traitors, there's a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured. I was on my 
own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, thought I was a Muggle-born in 
hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry." 

"What did you say to them?" 

"Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of." "And they believed that?" 

"They weren't the brightest. One of them was definitely part 
troll, the smell of him." 

Ron glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of humor, but 
her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs. 

"Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but 
there were still five of them and only one of me, and they'd taken my wand. Then two of them got 
into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the 
stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. I didn't do it so

well. Splinched myself again -" Ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails, 
Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly "-and I came out miles from where you were. By the time I 
got back to that bit of riverbank where we'd been ... you were gone." 

"Gosh, what a gripping story," Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to 
wound. "You must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric's Hollow and, let's 
think, what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who's snake turned up, it nearly killed 
both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and missed us by about a second." 

"What?" Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him.

 "Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into perspective, doesn't it?" 

"Hermione," said Harry quietly, "Ron just saved my life." 

She appeared not to have heard him. 

"One thing I would like to know, though," she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron's 
head. "How exactly did you find us tonight? That's important. Once we know, we'll be able to 
make sure we're not visited by anyone else we don't want to see." 

Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. "This." 

 She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them.

 "The Deluminator?" she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce. 

"It doesn't just turn the lights on and off," said Ron. "I don't know how it works or why it 
happened then and not any other time, because I've been wanting to come back ever since I left. 

But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard ... I heard you." 

He was looking at Hermione. 

"You heard me on the radio?" she asked incredulously. 

"No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice," he held up the Deluminator again, 
"came out of this." 

"And what exactly did I say?" asked Hermione, her tone somewhere between skepticism and 
curiosity. 

"My name. 'Ron.' And you said ... something about a wand." 

Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered, it had been the first time Ron's 
name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left. Hermione had mentioned it 
when talking about repairing Harry's wand. 

��277ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"So I took it out," Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, "and it didn't seem different or 
anything, but I was sure I'd heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but 
another light appeared right outside the window." 

Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something neither 
Harry nor Hermione could see. 

"It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you 
know?" 

"Yeah," said Harry and Hermione together automatically. 

"I knew this was it," said Ron. "I grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I put on my rucksack and 
went out into the garden. 

"The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it bobbed along 
a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it ... well, it went inside me." 

"Sorry?" said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly. 

"It sort of floated toward me," said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index finger, 
"right to my chest, and then - it just went straight through. It was here," he touched a point close to 
his heart, "I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me, I knew what I was supposed to do. 
I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a 
hill. There was snow everywhere." 

"We were there," said Harry. "We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I 
could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!" 

"Yeah, well, that would've been me," said Ron. "Your protective spells work, anyway, because I 
couldn't see you and I couldn't hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in 
my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you'd have to show yourselves 
when you packed up the tent." 

"No, actually," said Hermione. "We've been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an 
extra precaution. And we left really early, because as Harry says, we'd heard somebody blundering 
around." 

"Well, I stayed on that hill all day," said Ron. "I kept hoping you'd appear. But when it started to 
get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came 
out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn't see

you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end -and Harry did. Well, I 

saw the doe first, obviously." 

"You saw the what?" said Hermione sharply. 

They explained what had happened and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool 
unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to 
keep her limbs locked together. 

"But it must have been a Patronus!" she said. "Couldn't you see who was casting it? Didn't you 
see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can't believe this! Then what happened?" 

Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool, and had waited for him to 
resurface; how he had realized that something was wrong, dived in and saved Harry, then returned 
for the sword. He got as far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and Harry cut in. 

"- and Ron stabbed it with the sword." 

"And ... and it went? Just like that?" she whispered. 

"Well, it - it screamed," said Harry with half a glance at Ron. "Here." 

He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows. 

Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of 
Hermione's wand and turned to Ron. "Did you just say now that you got away from the snatchers 

with a spare wand?" 

"What?" said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket. "Oh - oh yeah." 

He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short dark wand out of his pocket. "Here, 

I figured it's always handy to have a backup." 

"You were right," said Harry, holding out his hand. "Mine's broken." 

"You're kidding?" Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked 
apprehensive again. 

Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into her bed and 
settled down without another word. 

Ron passed Harry the new wand. 

"About the best you could hope for, I think," murmured Harry. 

"Yeah," said Ron. "Could've been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?" 

"I still haven't ruled it out," came Hermione's muffled voice from beneath her blankets, but

Chapter Twenty 

Xenophilius Lovegood 

Harry had not expected Hermione's anger

remorse. In fact, when all three of them were

with Harry, 

however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became 
shamelessly cheery. 

"Someone helped us," he kept saying, "Someone sent that doe, Someone's on our side, One 
Horcrux down, mate!" 

Bolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible locations of the other 
Horcruxes even though they had discussed the matter so often before. Harry felt optimistic, certain 
that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione's sulkiness could not mar his buoyant 
spirits. The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery 
of Gryffindor��s sword, and above all, Ron's return made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult 
to maintain a straight face. 

Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione's baleful presence again and under the 
pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing 
exchange of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione's 
various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric's Hollow; Ron was 
now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during his 
weeks away. 

"... and how did you find out about the Taboo?" he asked Harry after explaining the many 
desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry." 

"The what?" 

��281ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who's name!" 

"Oh, yeah, well, it's just a bad habit we've slipped into," said Harry. "But I haven't got a problem 
calling him V -" 

"NO!" roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book 
at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. "Sorry," said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the 
brambles, "but the name's been jinxed, Harry, that's how they track people! Using his name breaks 
protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance -it's how they found us in 
Tottenham Court Road!" 

"Because we used his name?" 

"Exactly! You've got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious 
about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who even dared use it. Now they've put a Taboo on it, 
anyone who says it is trackable -quick-and-easy way to find Order members! They nearly got 
Kingsley -" 

"You're kidding?" 

"Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his way out. He's on the 
run now just like us." Ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand. "You don't 
reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?" 

"His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?" 

"Oh yeah...�� They moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione. "Harry... 
you don't reckon it could've been Dumbledore?" 

"Dumbledore what?" 

Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, "Dumbledore ... the doe? I mean," Ron 

was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, "he had the real sword last, didn't he? 

Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing behind the question. 

The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them, 

would have inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head. "Dumbledore��s dead," he said. "I saw it 

happen, I saw the body. He's definitely gone. Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe" 

"Patronuses can change, though can't they?" said Ron, "Tonks��s changed didn't it?" 

"Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn't he show himself? Why wouldn't he just hand 

us the sword?

��282ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Search me," said Ron. "Same reason he didn't give it to you while he was alive? Same reason 

he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kid's stories." 

"Which is what?" asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face desperate for the answer. 

"I dunno," said Ron. "Sometimes I've thought, when I've been a bit hack off (upset), he was 
having a laugh or -or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don't think so, not anymore. 
He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn't he? He -well," Ron's ears 
turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his 
toe, "he must've known I'd run out on you." 

"No," Harry corrected him. "He must've known you'd always want to come back." 

Ron looked grateful, but still awkward. 

Partly to change the subject, Harry said, "Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what 
Skeeter wrote about him?" 

"Oh yeah," said Ron at once, "people are talking about it quite a lot. 'Course, if things were 
different it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it's just something 
to laugh about for people who didn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone 
who thought he was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, though. He was really 
young when they -" 

"Our age," said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to 
decide Ron against pursuing the subject. 

A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry took aim at it with the 
wand Ron had given him the previous night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, 
and had decided was made of blackthorn. "Engorgio." The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing 
slightly in the web. Harry tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger. 

"Stop that," said Ron sharply, "I'm sorry I said Dumbledore was young, okay?" 

Harry had forgotten Ron's hatred of spiders. "Sorry -Reducio." The spider did not shrink. Harry 
looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had 
seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt 
intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of his arm. 

"You just need to practice," said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind 
and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. "It��s all a matter

of confidence Harry." 

He knew why she wanted it to be all right. She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit 
back the retort that sprung to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it 
made no difference, and he would have hers instead. 

Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a 
tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more. All three of them 
returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried 
to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier 
and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, 
after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and 
started to try to tune it. 

"There's this one program," he told Harry in a low voice, "that tells the news like it really is. All 
the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are following the Ministry line, but this one ... you 
wait till you hear it, it's great. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing 
locations in case they're raided and you need a password to tune in ... Trouble is, I missed the last 
one...�� 

He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random words under his 
breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the 
notice she took of him he might not have been there. 

For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her book, and 
Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand. Finally Hermione climbed down from her 
bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once. "If it's annoying you, I'll stop!" he told Hermione nervously. 

Hermione did not deign (condescend) to respond, but approached Harry. 

"We need to talk," she said. 

He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. 

"What?" he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in 
there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita's version of his relationship with Dumbledore. 

Hermione's answer however, was completely unexpected. "I want to go and see Xenophilius 
Lovegood." 

He stared at her. "Sorry?"

��284ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna��s father. I want to go and talk to him!�� 

��Er �C why?�� 

She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, ��It��s that mark, the mark in Beedle 
the Bard. Look at this!�� 

She thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry��s unwilling eyes and saw a 
photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore��s 
familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had 
written those words, that they had not been Rita��s invention. 

��The signature,�� said Hermione. ��Look at the signature, Harry!�� 

He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely 
with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny 
version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard. 

��Er �C what are you -?�� said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned 
back to Harry. 

��It keeps cropping up, doesn��t it?�� she said. ��I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald��s mark, but 
it was definitely on that old grave in Godric��s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long 
before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can��t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald 
what it means �C I don��t even know whether Grindelwald��s still alive �C but we can ask Mr. 
Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I��m sure this is important, Harry!�� 

Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and then out into the 
surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, ��Hermione, we don��t need another 
Godric��s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and �C�� 

��But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you 
know we��re not supposed to find out about the sign?�� 

��Here we go again!�� Harry felt slightly exasperated. ��We keep trying to convince ourselves 
Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues �C�� 

��The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,�� piped up Ron. ��I think Hermione��s right, I 
think we ought to go and see Lovegood.�� 

Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron��s support of Hermione had little to do 
with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. 

��285ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It won��t be like Godric��s Hollow,�� Ron added, ��Lovegood��s on your side, Harry, The 

Quibbler��s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they��ve got to help you!��

 ��I��m sure this is important!�� said Hermione earnestly.

 ��But don��t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?�� 

��Maybe ... maybe it��s something you need to find out for yourself,�� said Hermione with a faint 

air of clutching at straws. 

 ��Yeah,�� said Ron sycophantically, ��that makes sense.�� 

��No, it doesn��t,�� snapped Hermione, ��but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A 

symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric��s Hollow. Harry, I��m sure we ought to 

know about this!��

 ��I think we should vote on it,�� said Ron. ��Those in favor of going to see Lovegood �C�� 

His hand flew into the air before Hermione��s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her 
own. 

��Outvoted, Harry, sorry,�� said Ron, clapping him on the back. 

��Fine,�� said Harry, half amused, half irritated�ֿ����ֺ�Ц 
. ��Only, once we��ve seen 
Lovegood, let��s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegood��s live, 
anyway? Do either of you know? 

��Yeah, they��re not far from my place,�� said Ron. ��I dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad 
always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn��t be hard to find.��

 When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice. 

 ��You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.�� 

��All's fair in love and war,�� said Ron brightly, ��and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it��s the 

Christmas holidays, Luna��ll be home!�� 

They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchopole from the breezy hillside to 
which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point the village looked like a 
collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks 
between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow, their hands shadowing 
their eyes, but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard, which 
afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes.

��286ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It��s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,�� said Ron. 

��Well, it��s not like you haven��t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,�� said Hermione 
coldly. 

��I wasn��t at the Burrow!�� said Ron with an incredulous laugh. ��Do you think I was going to go 
back there and tell them all I��d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and George would��ve been great 
about it. And Ginny, she��d have been really understanding.��

 ��But where have you been, then?�� asked Hermione, surprised. 

��Bill and Fleur��s new place. Shell cottage. Bill��s always been decent to me. He �C he wasn��t 
impressed when he heard what I��d done, but he didn��t go on about it. He knew I was really sorry. 
None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren��t going home 
for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You know, first holiday after they were 
married. I don��t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.��

 Ron turned his back on the Burrow. 

 ��Let��s try up here,�� he said, leading the way over the top of the hill. 

They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione��s insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility 
Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage, which 
seemed deserted. 

��Do you think it��s theirs, and they��ve gone away for Christmas?�� said Hermione, peering 
through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. 

Ron snorted. ��Listen, I��ve got a feeling you��d be able to tell who lived there if you looked 
through the Lovegoods�� window. Let��s try the next lot of hills.��

 So they Disapparated a few miles farther north. 

��Aha!�� shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was pointing upward, 
toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose 
vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the 
afternoon sky. ��That��s got to be Luna��s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks 
like a giant rook����ѻ����ѻ; (Chess) castle - ��!��

 ��It��s nothing like a bird,�� said Hermione, frowning at the tower. 

 ��I was talking about a chess rook,�� said Ron. ��A castle to you.�� 

Ron��s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When Harry and Hermione

��287ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they found him grinning broadly.

 ��It��s theirs,�� said Ron. ��Look.��

 Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broke-down gate. 

The first read: THE QUIBBLER. EDITOR, X. LOVEGOOD 

the second: PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE 

the third: KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS 

The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door was 
overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in orange radishlike fruit Luna 
sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened 
stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of leaves but still 
heavy with berry-sized red fruits, and bushy crowns of white beaded mistletoe stood sentinel on 
either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened hawk-like head peered down at 
them from one of the branches. 

��You��d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,�� said Hermione. ��It��s you Mr. Lovegood 
wants to help, not us.�� 

He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She then rapped 
three times on the thick black door, which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped 
like an eagle. 

Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, 
barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was 
dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur's wedding by 
comparison. 

"What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?" he cried in a high-pitched, querulous 
voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open 
in a perfect, comical O. 

"Hello, Mr. Lovegood," said Harry, holding out his hand, "I'm Harry, Harry Potter." 

Xenophilius did not take Harry's hand, although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose

��288ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

slid straight to the scar on Harry's forehead. 

"Would it be okay if we came in?" asked Harry. "There's something we'd like to ask you." 

"I ... I'm not sure that's advisable," whispered Xenophilius. He swallowed and cast a quick look 

around the garden. "Rather a shock... My word... I ...I'm afraid I don't really think I ought to -" 

"It won't take long" said Harry, slightly disappointed by this less-than-warm welcome. 

"I - oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!" 

They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them. 
They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly 
circular, so that he felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls the 
stove, the sink, and the cupboards -and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and 
birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he recognized Luna's styles. The effect, in such an 
enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming. 

In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper levels. There was a 
great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead, Harry wondered what Luna could be 
doing. 

"You'd better come up." said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable, and he led the 
way. 

The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and, as such, was 
even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller and entirely round, the room 
somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had 
transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were 
piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures Harry 
did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling. 

Luna was not there. The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in 
magically turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of 
shelves, but after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the 
fact that it was churning out Quibblers. 

"Excuse me," said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized grubbily tablecloth 
from beneath an immense number of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the floor, and 
threw it over the press, somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.

"Why have you come here?" Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry 

of shock. 

"Mr. Lovegood - what's that?" 

She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been 

mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room. 

"It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack," said Xenophilius. 

"No it isn't!" said Hermione. 

"Hermione," muttered Harry, embarrassed, "now's not the moment -" 

"But Harry, it's an Erumpent horn! It's a Class B Tradeable Material and it's an extraordinary 
dangerous thing to have in a house!" 

"How'd you know it's an Erumpent horn?" asked Ron, edging away from the horn as fast as he 
could, given the extreme clutter of the room. 

"There's a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to 
get rid of it straightaway, don't you know it can explode at the slightest touch?" 

"The Crumple Horned Snorkack," said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish look upon his face, 
��is a shy and highly magical creature, and it's horn -" 

"Mr. Lovegood. I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that's an Erumpent horn and 
it's incredibly dangerous - I don't know where you got it -" 

"I bought it," said Xenophilius dogmatically. "Two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard 
who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now," he 
said, turning to Harry, "why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?" 

"We need some help," said Harry, before Hermione could start again. 

"Ah," said Xenophilius, "Help, Hmm." 

His good eye moved again to Harry's scar. He seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized. 

"Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather dangerous...�� 

"Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?" said Ron. "In 
that magazine of yours?" 

Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging and clattering 
beneath the tablecloth. 

"Er - yes, I have expressed that view. However -" 

��290ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"That's for everyone else to do, not you personally?" said Ron. 

Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. 
Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle. 

"Where's Luna?" asked Hermione. "Let's see what she thinks." 

Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steelingʹ��ǿ 
,ʹ�¾��� 
himself. Finally he said in a 
shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, "Luna is down at the stream, 
fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She... she will like to see you. I'll go and call her and then -yes, 
very well. I shall try to help you." 

He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front open and close. They looked 

at each other. 

"Cowardly old wart," said Ron. "Luna's got ten times his guts." 

"He's probably worried about what'll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here" 
said Harry. 

"Well, I agree with Ron," said Hermione, "Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help 
you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven's sake keep away from that horn." 

Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering 
ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the 
window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. 
Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than they had been since 
Bill and Fleur's wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, thinking of 
her. He suppose he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, 
Xenophilius's attitude proved that. 

He turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon 
the cluttered, curved slide board; a stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a 
most bizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets����״������ 
curved out from the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran 
over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around 
her forehead. 

"Look at this," said Harry. 

"Fetching," said Ron. "Surprised he didn't wear that to the wedding." 

��291ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius climbed back up the spiral 
staircase into the room, his thin legs now encase in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted 
teacups and a steaming teapot. 

"Ah, you have spotted my pet invention," he said, shoving the tray into Hermione's arms and 
joining Harry at the statue's side. "Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful 
Rowens Ravenclaw, 'Wit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure!'" 

He indicated the objects like ear trumpets. "These are the Wrackpurt siphons -to remove all 
sources of distraction from the thinker's immediate area. Here," he pointed out the tiny wings, "a 
billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind�ľ� 
/��. Finally," he pointed to the orange 
radish, "the dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary." 

Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to balance precariously 
on one of the cluttered side tables. 

"May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?" said Xenophilius. "We make it ourselves." As 
he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice, he added, "Luna is 
down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She ought not to be too long, 
she has caught nearly enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help 
yourselves to sugar. 

"Now," he remove a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned 
legs crossed, "how may I help you, Mr. Potter?" 

"Well," said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly, "it's about that symbol 
you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur's wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered 
what it meant." 

Xenophilius raised his eyebrows. "Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?"

Chapter Twenty-One 
The Tale of the Three Brothers 


Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. 


Neither of 
them seemed to have understood what 
Xenophilius had said either. 

"The Deathly Hallows?" 

"That's right," said Xenophilius. "You haven't 

heard of 
them? I'm not surprised. Very, very few wizards 

believe. 

Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother's wedding," he nodded at Ron, "who 
attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is 
nothing Dark about the Hallows �C at least not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to 
reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest." 

He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some. 

"I'm sorry," said Harry, "I still don't really understand." 

To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged. The stuff was quite disgusting, 
as though someone had liquidized booger-flavored Every Flavor Beans. 

"Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows," said Xenophilius, smacking his lips in 

apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. 

"But what are the Deathly Hallows?" asked Hermione. 

Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. 

"I assume that you are familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'?" 

Harry said, "No," but Ron and Hermione both said, "Yes." Xenophilius nodded gravely. 

"Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers' ... I have a 
copy somewhere ...�� 

He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, 
"I've got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I've got it right here." 

And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. 

"The original?" inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, "Well then, why 

don't you read it out aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all understand."

��293ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Er... all right," said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol 

they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read. 

"'There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight �C'" 

"Midnight, our mum always told us," said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to 

listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. 

"Sorry, I just think it's a bit spookier if it's midnight!" said Ron. 

"Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives," said Harry before he could stop 
himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window 
at the sky. "Go on, Hermione." 

"In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim 
across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their 
wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when 
they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. 

"'And Death spoke to them �C'" 

"Sorry," interjected Harry, "but Death spoke to them?" 

"It's a fairy tale, Harry!" 

"Right, sorry. Go on." 

"'And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of the three new victims, 
for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate 
the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever 
enough to evade him. 

"'So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in 
existence, a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had 
conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree�ӹ�ľ on the banks of the river, fashioned a 
wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother. 

"'Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate 
Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a 
stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have 
the power to bring back the dead. 

"'And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest

��294ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he 
asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by 
Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.'" 

"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?" Harry interrupted again. 

"So he can sneak up on people," said Ron. "Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, 
flapping his arms and shrieking ... sorry, Hermione." 

"'Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did 
so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring Death's gifts. 

"'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. 

"'The first brother traveled on for a week more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a 
fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he 
could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor the oldest 
brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from 
Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. 

"'That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden upon his 

bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure (in addition to), slit the oldest brother's throat. 

"'And so Death took the first brother for his own. 

"'Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took 
out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his 
amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely 
death, appeared at once before him. 

"'Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the 
mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad 
with hopeless longing, killed himself so as to truly join her. 

"'And so Death took the second brother for his own. 

"'But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find 
him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the 
Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And the he greeted Death as an old friend, and went 
with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.'" 

Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that

��295ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

she had stopped reading; then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, "Well, there you 

are." 

"Sorry?" said Hermione, sounding confused. 

"Those are the Deathly Hallows," said Xenophilius. 

He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from 

between more books. 

"The Elder Wand," he said, and drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. "The 
Resurrection Stone," he said, and added a circle on top of the line. "The Cloak of Invisibility," he 
finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbols that so intrigued 
Hermione. "Together," he said, "the Deathly Hallows." 

"But there's no mention of the words 'Deathly Hallows' in the story," said Hermione. 

"Well, of course not," said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. "That is a children's tale, told to 
amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize that 
the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor 
master of Death." 

There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was 

low in the sky. 

"Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon," he said quietly. 

"When you say 'master of Death'..."said Ron. 

"Master," said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. "Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you 

prefer." 

"But then ... do you mean ...�� said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to 
keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, "that you believe these objects �C these Hallows �C 
really exist?" 

Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. "Well, of course." 

"But," said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, "Mr. Lovegood, how 
can you possibly believe �C?" 

"Luna has told me all about you, young lady," said Xenophilius. "You are, I gather, not 
unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded." 

"Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione," said Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous

��296ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing. 

"Mr. Lovegood," Hermione began again, "We all know that there are such things as Invisibility 
Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But �C" 

"Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a 
traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else 
woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns 
opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, 
and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are 
cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?" 

Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever. 
She, Harry and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same 
thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the 
room with them at that very moment. 

"Exactly," said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. "None of you 

have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?" 

He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink. 

"All right," said Hermione, disconcerted. "Say the Cloak existed... what about that stone, Mr. 

Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?" 

"What of it?" 

"Well, how can that be real?" 

"Prove that is not," said Xenophilius. 

Hermione looked outraged. 

"But that's �C I'm sorry, but that's completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn't 
exist? Do you expect me to get hold of �C of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you 
could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody's proved it doesn't 
exist!" 

"Yes, you could," said Xenophilius. "I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little." 

"So the Elder Wand," said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, "you think that exists 
too?" 

"Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence," said Xenophilius. "The Elder Wand is the

��297ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand." 

"Which is what?" asked Harry. 

"Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be 
truly master of it," said Xenophilius. "Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert 
the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after 
his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from 
Baraabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the 
pages of Wizarding history." 

Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him. 

"So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?" asked Ron. 

"Alas, who knows?" said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. "Who knows where the 
Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them 
really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? 
History, alas, does not tell us." 

There was a pause. 

Finally Hermione asked stiffly, "Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do 
with the Deathly Hallows?" 

Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry's memory, but he could not locate 
it. Peverell... he had heard that name before... 

"But you have been misleading me, young woman!" said Xenophilius, now sitting up much 
straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. "I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! 
Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything �C everything! �C to do with the 
Hallows!" 

"Who are the Peverells?" asked Ron. 

"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric's Hollow," said Hermione, still 
watching Xenophilius. "Ignotus Peverell." 

"Exactly!" said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedanticallyѧ��ʽ�� ;��Ūѧ�ʵ�. "The 
sign of the Death Hallows on Ignotus's grave is conclusive proof!" 

"Of what?" asked Ron. 

"Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch,

��298ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cadmus and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!" 

With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the 
spiral staircase. 

"You will stay for dinner?" he called, as he vanished downstairs again. "Everybody always 
requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimply soup." 

"Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo's," said Ron under his breath. 

Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before 

speaking. 

"What do you think?" he asked Hermione. 

"Oh, Harry," she said wearily, "it's a pile of utter rubbish. This can't be what the sign really 

means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time." 

"I s'pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks," said Ron. 

"You didn't believe it either?" Harry asked him. 

"Nah, that story's just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn't it? 'Don't go 
looking for trouble, don't go pick fights, don't go messing around with stuff that's best left alone! 
Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be okay'. Come to think of it," Ron 
added, "maybe that's story's reason why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"One of those superstitions, isn't it? 'May-born witches will marry Muggles.' 'Jinx by twilight, 
undone by midnight.' 'Wand of cider, never prosper.' You must have heard them. My mum's full of 
them." 

"Harry and I were raised by Muggles," Hermione reminded him. "We were taught different 
superstitions." She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one 
good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget 
that she was annoyed at Ron. "I think you're right," she told him. "It's just a morality tale, it's 
obvious which gift is best, which one you'd choose �C" 

The three of them spoke at the same time, Hermione said, "the Cloak," Ron said, "the wand," 

and Harry said, "the stone." 

They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused. 

"You're supposed to say the Cloak," Ron told Hermione, "but you wouldn't need to be invisible

��299ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!" 

 "We've already got an Invisibility Cloak," said Harry. 

"And it's helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn't noticed!" said Hermione. "Whereas the wand 

would be bound to attract trouble -" 

"Only if you shouted about it," argued Ron. "Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around 
waving it over your head, and singing, 'I've got an unbeatable want, come and have a go if you 
think you're hard enough.' As long as you kept your trap (Slang) mouth shut -" 

"Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?" said Hermione, looking skeptical. "You know the 
only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for 
hundreds of years." 

"There have?" asked Harry. 

Hermione looked exasperated. The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron 
grinned at each other. "The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names 
through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who��s boasting about them. 
Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but -oh it's all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as 
the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than 
other people's." 

"But how do you know," said Harry, "that those wands -the Deathstick, and the Wand of 

Destiny - aren't the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?" 

"What, and they're all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?" said Ron. 

Harry laughed. The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all, ridiculous. His wand, he 
reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it 
had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies and if it had been unbeatable, how 
could it have been broken? 

"So why would you take the stone?" Ron asked him. 

"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius... Mad-Eye... Dumbledore... my 
parents...�� 

Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled. 

"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn't want to come back, would they?" said Harry, 

thinking about the tale they had just heard. "I don't suppose there have been loads of other stories

��300ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?" he asked Hermione. 

"No," she replied sadly. "I don't think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that's 
possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer's Stone; you know, instead of a stone to 
make you immortal, a stone to reverse death." 

The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger. It was something like burning underpants. 
Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking 
to spare���˺�his feelings. 

"What about the Cloak, though?" said Ron slowly. "Don't you realize, he's right? I've got so 
used to Harry's Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I've never heard of one like 
Harry's. It's infallible. We've never been spotted under it -" 

"Of course not - we're invisible when we're under it, Ron!" 

"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they're not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is 
true! It's never occurred to me before but I've heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when 
they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they've got holes. Harry's was owned by his 
dad, so it's not exactly new, is it, but it's just ... perfect!" 

"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone...�� 

As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching the 
spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face 
was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a moment's bewilderment, he 
realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to clime the stairs. 

"Harry, what are you doing? I don't think you should look around when he's not here!" 

But Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five 
beautifully painted faces, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the 
portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them all the same. Harry thought 
they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them 
together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually 
one work repeated a thousand times in golden ink, friends... friends... friends... Harry felt a great 
rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a large photograph beside the 
bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked 
rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty.

��301ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet 
was also thick with dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed 
had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched 
over the nearest window across the blood red sky. 

"What's wrong?" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, 

Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls. 

"Mr. Lovegood," said Harry. "Where's Luna?" 

"Excuse me?" 

"Where's Luna?" 

Xenophilius halted on the top step. "I -I've already told you. She is down at the Botions Bridge 

fishing for Plimpies." 

"So why have you only laid that tray for four?" 

Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued chugging
���������� of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius's hands shook. 

"I don't think Luna's been here for weeks." said Harry. "Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn't 
been slept in. Where is she? and why do you keep looking out of the window?" 

Xenophilius dropped the tray. The bowls bounced and smashed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
drew their wands. Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the 
printing press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming across the floor from 
underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last. 

Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. 

Lovegood. 

"Harry, look at this." 

He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. The front of the Quibbler 
carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words "Undesirable Number One" and captioned 
with the reward money. 

"The Quibbler's going for a new angle, then?" Harry asked coldly, his mind working very fast. 
"Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to 
the Ministry?�� 

Xenophilius licked his lips.

"They took my Luna," he whispered, "Because of what I've been writing. They took my Luna 
and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her back to me if I If 
I -" 

"Hand over Harry?" Hermione finished for him. 

"No deal." said Ron flatly. "Get out of the way, we're leaving." 

Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer. 

"They will be here any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave." He 
spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the 

same thing in front of his crib. 

"Don't make us hurt you," Harry said. "Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood." 

"HARRY!" Hermione screamed. 

Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from 
him. Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time. He launched himself 
sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as Xenophilius's Stunning Spell soared 
across the room and hit the Erumpent horn. There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it 
seemed to blow the room apart. Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, 
along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to 
the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard Hermione's 
scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him that Xenophilius had 
been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. Half buried in rubble, Harry 
tried to raise himself. He could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fall in and the 
end of Luna's bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him 
with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of 
the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another 
white shape moved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger 
to her lips. 

The door downstairs crashed open. "Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?" said 

a rough voice. "Didn't I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?" 

There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius. "No... no... upstairs... Potter!" 

"I told you last week Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some solid

information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid 
bleeding headdress? And the week before" -Another bang, another squeal -"When you thought 
we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are "Cumple" -bang -"Headed" �C bang "
Snorkacks?" 

"No - no - I beg of you!" sobbed Xenophilius. "It really is Potter, Really!" 

"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!" roared the Death Eater, 
and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius. 

"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn," said a cool second voice, echoing up the 
mangled staircase. "The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might bring the place 
down." 

"You lying piece of filth." shouted the wizard named Selwyn. "You have never seen Potter in 
your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you'll get your 
girl back like this?" 

"I swear... I swear... Potter's upstairs!" 

"Homenum revelio." said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he 
had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow. 

"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn," said the second man sharply. 

"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!" sobbed Xenophilius. "Please... please... give me Luna, just let 

me have Luna...�� 

"You can have your little girl, Lovegood," said Selwyn, "if you get up those stairs and bring me 
down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice waiting up there 
to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury." 

Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings. Xenophilius 
was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. 

"Come on," Harry whispered, "we've got to get out of here." He started to dig himself out under 
cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried the deepest. Harry 
and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to 
prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius��s banging and scraping drew nearer 
and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. 

"All right." breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs begin

��304ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to tremble. Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. "Do you trust me, 

Harry?" 

Harry nodded. 

"Okay then." Hermione whispered. "give me the invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to put it 

on." 

"Me? But Harry -" 

"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron grab my shoulder." 

Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking the 

stairs was vibrating. Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know 

what Hermione was waiting for. 

"Hold tight" she whispered. "Hold tight... any second...�� 

Xenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. "Obliviate!" cried 
Hermione, pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath them. "Deprimo!" She had 
blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders. Harry still holding onto her hand 
for dear life, there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way 
as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. 
Hermione twisted in midair and thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she 
dragged him once more into darkness.

Chapter Twenty-Two 
The Deathly Hallows 



Harry fell, panting, onto grass and 

scrambled up 
at once. They seemed to have landed in the 

corner of a 
field at dusk; Hermione was already 

running in a 
circle around them, waving her wand. 
��Protego Totalum... Salvio Hexia...�� 
��That treacherous old bleeder.�� Ron 

panted, 
emerging from beneath the Invisibility 

Cloak and 
throwing it to Harry. ��Hermione you��re a genius, a total 
genius. I can��t believe we got out of that.�� 

��Cave Inimicum... Didn��t I say it was an Erumpent horn, didn��t I tell him? And now his house 
has been blown apart!�� 

��Serves him right,�� said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs, ��What��d you 
reckon they��ll do to him?�� 

��Oh I hope they don��t kill him!�� groaned Hermione, ��That��s why I wanted the Death Eaters to 
get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn��t been lying!��

 ��Why hide me though?�� asked Ron. 

��You��re supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt, Ron! They��ve kidnapped Luna because her 

father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew you��re with him?��

 ��But what about your mum and dad?��

 ��They��re in Australia,�� said Hermione, ��They should be all right. They don��t know anything.�� 

��You��re a genius,�� Ron repeated, looking awed. 

��Yeah, you are, Hermione,�� agreed Harry fervently. ��I don��t know what we��d do without you.�� 

She beamed, but became solemn at once. ��What about Luna?�� 

��Well, if they��re telling the truth and she��s still alive -�� began Ron. 

��Don��t say that, don��t say it!�� squealed Hermione. ��She must be alive, she must!�� 

��Then she��ll be in Azkaban, I expect,�� said Ron. ��Whether she survives the place, though... 
Loads don��t...��

��306ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��She will,�� said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. ��She��s tough, Luna, 
much tougher than you��d think. She��s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and 
Nargles.�� 

��I hope you��re right,�� said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. ��I��d feel so sorry for 

Xenophilius if -�� 

��-if he hadn��t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,�� said Ron. 

They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their narrow 

escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home, safe, familiar, and friendly. 

��Oh, why did we go there?�� groaned Hermione after a few minutes�� silence. ��Harry, you were 
right, it was Godric��s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows... 
such rubbish... although actually,�� a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, ��he might have 
made it all up, mightn��t he? He probably doesn��t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just 
wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!�� 

��I don��t think so,�� said Ron. ��It��s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you��re under stress 
than you��d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to 
be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was 
under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he 
thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.�� 

��Well, I don��t suppose it matters,�� sighed Hermione. ��Even if he was being honest, I never 

heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.�� 

��Hang on, though,�� said Ron. ��The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn��t it?�� 

��But the Deathly Hallows can��t exist, Ron!�� 

��You keep saying that, but one of them can,�� said Ron. ��Harry��s Invisibility Cloak -�� 

��The Tale of the Three Brothers is a story,�� said Hermione firmly. ��A story about how humans 
are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we��d 
have everything we need already!�� 

��I don��t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,�� said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand 
he so disliked over in his fingers. 

��There��s no such thing, Harry!�� 

��You said there have been loads of wands - the Deathstick and whatever they were called -��

��307ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand��s real, what about the Resurrection 
Stone?�� Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. ��No 
magic can raise the dead, and that��s that!�� 

��When my wand connected with You-Know-Who��s, it made my mum and dad appear... and 
Cedric...�� 

��But they weren��t really back from the dead, were they?�� said Hermione. ��Those kind of -of 
pale imitations aren��t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.�� 

��But she, the girl in the tale, didn��t really come back, did she? The story says that once people 
are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, 
didn��t he? He even lived with her for a while...�� 

He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione��s expression. Then, as she 
glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear. He had scared her with his talk of living with dead 
people. 

��So that Peverell bloke who��s buried in Godric��s Hollow,�� he said hastily, trying to sound 
robustly sane, ��you don��t know anything about him, then?�� 

��No,�� she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. ��I looked him up after I saw the 
mark on his grave; if he��d been anyone famous or done anything important, I��m sure he��d be in 
one of our books. The only place I��ve managed to find the name 'Peverell' is Nature��s Nobility, A 
Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,�� she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. ��It 
lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were 
one of the earliest families to vanish.�� 

��Extinct in the male line?�� repeated Ron. 

��It means the name died out,�� said Hermione, ��centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They 
could still have descendents, though, they��d just be called something different.�� 

And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the 
name ��Peverell��, a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he 
cried aloud, ��Marvolo Gaunt!�� 

��Sorry?�� said Ron and Hermione together. 

��Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who��s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo 
Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!��

��308ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Ron and Hermione looked bewildered. 

��The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms 
on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry��s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!�� 

��The Peverell coat of arms?�� said Hermione sharply. ��Could you see what it looked like?�� 

��Not really,�� said Harry, trying to remember. ��There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I 

could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked 

open.�� 

Harry saw Hermione��s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. 

Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished. ��Blimey... You reckon it was this sign 

again? The sign of the Hallows? 

��Why not?�� said Harry excitedly, ��Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, 
all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he 
might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he 
wasn��t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He��d have loved to think the scratches on the stone 
were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically 
royal.�� 

��Yes... and that��s all very interesting,�� said Hermione cautiously, ��but Harry, if you��re thinking 
what I think you��re think -�� 

��Well, why not? Why not?�� said Harry, abandoning caution. ��It was a stone, wasn��t it?�� He 
looked at Ron for support. ��What if it was the Resurrection Stone?�� 

Ron��s mouth fell open. 

��Blimey - but would it still work if Dumbledore broke -?�� 

��Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There��s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!�� 

Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. ��Harry you��re trying to fit everything 
into the Hallows story -�� 

��Fit everything in?�� he repeated. ��Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the 
Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!�� 

��A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!�� 

��Where��d you reckon the ring is now?�� Ron asked Harry. ��What did Dumbledore do with it 

after he broke it open?��

��309ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

But Harry��s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione��s... 

Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death... Master... 
Conqueror... Vanquisher... The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death... 

And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose Horcruxes were no 
match... Neither can live while the other survives... Was this the answer? Hallows versus 
Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the 
master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? 

��Harry?�� 

But he scarcely heard Hermione. He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it 
through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in 
his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had 
described, A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures 
eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it... 

And then, with a gasp, he remembered. ��Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!�� 

His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. 

��My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine 
it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric��s Hollow...�� 

Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were 
opening all around him. ��He��s my ancestor. I��m descended from the third brother! It all makes 
sense!�� 

He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them 
was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two. 

��Harry,�� said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers 
shaking hard. 

��Read it,�� he told her, pushing his mother��s letter into her hand. ��Read it! Dumbledore had the 
Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn��t need a Cloak, he could perform a 
Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!�� 

Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair, He had dislodged the Snitch 
when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of 
fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he

��310ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

shouted out. 

��IT��S IN HERE! He left me the ring �C it��s in the Snitch!�� 

��You - you reckon?�� 

He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear to Harry. 
Everything fit, everything... His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open 
the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the 
Elder Wand, and then... 

But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage. All his excitement, all his hope and happiness 
were extinguished at a strokeһ���� , and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell 
was broken. 

��That��s what he��s after.�� 

The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. 

��You-Know-Who��s after the Elder Wand.�� 

He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made 
sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand 
indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked 
out into the night, thinking... 

Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him The Tales of 
Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards 
believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them? 

Harry gazed into the darkness... If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he 
would have sought them, done anything to possess them, three objects that made the possessor 
master of Death. If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes 
in the first place. Didn��t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, 
demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret? 

Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power, without 
understanding that it was one of three... for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden, 
whose existence was best known... The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the 
pages of Wizarding history... 

Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white

��311ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. 

He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he 
had left them, Hermione still holding Lily��s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn��t 
they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes? 

��This is it?�� Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty, 
��This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I��ve got one - maybe two -�� 

He held up the Snitch. ��-and You-Know-Who��s chasing the third, but he doesn��t realize... he 
just thinks it��s a powerful wand -�� 

��Harry,�� said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily��s letter, ��I��m sorry, 
but I think you��ve got this wrong, all wrong.�� 

��But don��t you see? It all fits -�� 

��Not, it doesn��t,�� she said. ��It doesn��t. Harry, you��re just getting carried away. Please,�� she said 
as he started to speak, ��please just answer me this. If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and 
Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of 
Death - Harry, why wouldn��t he have told you? Why?�� 

He had his answer ready. ��But you said it, Hermione! You��ve got to find out about them for 
yourself! It��s a Quest!�� 

��But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods'!�� cried Hermione in 
exasperation. ��I didn��t really believe it!�� 

Harry took no notice. ��Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my 
strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he��d do.�� 

��Harry, this isn��t a game, this isn��t practice! This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very 
clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn��t mean anything, forget the 
Deathly Hallows, we can��t afford to get sidetracked -�� 

Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half 
expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was 
right, that the Deathly Hallows were real. 

She appealed to Ron. ��You don��t believe in this, do you?�� 

Harry looked up, Ron hesitated.

��312ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I dunno... I mean... bits of it sort of fit together,�� said Ron awkwardly, ��But when you look at 
the whole thing...�� He took a deep breath. ��I think we��re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. 
That��s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe... maybe we should forget about this Hallows 
business.�� 

��Thank you, Ron,�� said Hermione. ��I��ll take first watch.�� 

And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a fierce full 
stop. 

But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, 
and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind, the wand, the stone, and 
the Cloak, if he could just possess them all... 

I open at the close... But what was the close? Why couldn��t he have the stone now? If only he 
had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person... and Harry murmured words to 
the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not 
open... 

And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? 
Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort��s thoughts, because for the first time 
ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing... Hermione would not like 
that idea, of course... But then, she did not believe. Xenophilius had been right, in a way... Limited, 
Narrow, Close-minded. The truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, 
especially of the Resurrection Stone... and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, 
nearly swallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield... 

It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by 
dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish 
contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but dementors in those numbers 
would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not tried casting a Patronus 
with the blackthorn wand... He must try that in the morning... 

If only there was a way of getting a better wand... 

And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed him once 
more... 

They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The

��313ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through 
the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think 
only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not 
Hermione��s flat disbelief nor Ron��s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the 
longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and 
Hermione. Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his 
spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry��s belief in and 
longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their 
obsession with the Horcruxes. 

��Obsession?�� said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the 
word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more 
Horcruxes. ��We��re not the one with an obsession, Harry! We��re the ones trying to do what 
Dumbledore wanted us to do!�� 

But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for 
Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone 
hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other survives... master of Death... Why 
didn��t Ron and Hermione understand? 

��The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,���� Harry quoted calmly. 

��I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?�� Hermione retorted, and 
Harry gave up on her. 

Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less 
important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him 
was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the 
other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The 
visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting 
as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct 
features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow 
than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was 
worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that

��314ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these 
unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand��s 
fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort��s mind as well as before. 

As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-absorption, 
that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having 
walked out on (desert, abandon) them, perhaps because Harry��s descent into listlessness 
galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the 
other two into action. 

��Three Horcruxes left,�� he kept saying. ��We need a plan of action, come on! Where haven��t we 
looked? Let��s go through it again. The orphanage...�� 

Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they 
knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered. Ron and Hermione raked over 
them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to 
sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort��s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, 
but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep 
them moving. 

��You never know,�� was Ron��s constant refrain. ��Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he 
might��ve wanted to live there. Let��s go and have a poke around.�� 

These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of 
Snatchers. 

��Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,�� said Ron. ��The lot that got me were 
a bit pathetic, but Bill reckons some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch �C�� 

��On what?�� said Harry. 

��Potterwatch, didn��t I tell you that��s what it was called? The program I keep trying to get on the 
radio, the only one that tells the truth about what��s going on! Nearly all of the programs are 
following You-Know-Who��s line, all except Potterwatch, I really want you to hear it, but it��s 
tricky tuning in...�� 

Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the 
wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat 
dragonpox, and once a few bars of ��A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love.�� While he taped, Ron

��315ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

continued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random words under his 
breath. 

��They��re normally something to do with the Order,�� he told them. ��Bill had a real knack for 
guessing them. I��m bound to get one in the end...�� 

But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard 
duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly 
ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. 

��I��ve got it, I��ve got it! Password was 'Albus'! Get in here, Harry.�� 

Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried 
back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. 
Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting 
open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing. 

��... apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a number of house 

calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.�� 

��But that��s Lee Jordan!�� said Hermione. 

��I know!�� beamed Ron. ��Cool, eh?�� 

��... now found ourselves another secure location,�� Lee was saying, and I��m pleased to tell you 

that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!�� 

��Hi.�� 

��Evening, River.�� 

����River���� that��s Lee,�� Ron explained. ��They��ve all got code names, but you can usually tell -�� 

��Shh!�� said Hermione. 

��But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,�� Lee went on, ��let��s take a moment to report 
those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don��t think important 
enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks 
and Dirk Cresswell.�� 

Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one another in horror. 

��A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas 
and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may 
have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents

��316ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and sisters are desperate for news. 

��Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle 
authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix 
inform me that it was the Killing Curse -more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that 
Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime. 

��Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been 
discovered in Godric��s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the 
Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic. 

��Listeners, I��d like to invite you now to join us in a minute��s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, 
Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles 
murdered by the Death Eaters.�� 

Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, 
half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to 
the outside world for a long time. 

��Thank you,�� said Lee��s voice. ��And now we can return to regular contributor Royal, for an 

update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.�� 

��Thanks, River,�� said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured���ȵ�, reassuring. 

��Kingsley!�� burst out Ron. 

��We know!�� said Hermione, hushing him. 

��Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy 
casualties,�� said Kingsley. ��However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and 
witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the 
Muggles' knowledge. I��d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulateЧ�� 
their example, perhaps 
by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved 
if such simple measures are taken.�� 

��And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it 
should be ��Wizards first��?�� asked Lee. 

��I��d say that it��s one short step from ��Wizards first�� to ��Purebloods first,�� and then to ��Death 
Eaters,���� replied Kingsley. ��We��re all human, aren��t we? Every human life is worth the same, and 
worth saving.��

��317ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Excellently put, Royal, and you��ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this 
mess,�� said Lee. ��And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature (in a newspaper) regular 
column) 'Pals of Potter'.�� 

��Thanks, River,�� said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but Hermione 
forestalled him in a whisper. 

��We know it��s Lupin!�� 

��Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you��ve appeared on our program, that Harry 
Potter is still alive?�� 

��I do,�� said Lupin firmly. ��There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be 
proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a 
deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. 'The Boy Who Lived' remains a 
symbol of everything for which we are fighting, the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the 
need to keep resisting.�� 

A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the 

terrible things he had said when they had last met? 

��And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?�� 

��I��d tell him we��re all with him in spirit,�� said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, ��And I��d tell him 

to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.�� 

Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. 

��Nearly always right,�� she repeated. 

��Oh, didn��t I tell you?�� said Ron in surprise. ��Bill told me Lupin��s living with Tonks again! And 
apparently she��s getting pretty big too...�� 

��... and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter��s who are suffering for their 
allegiance?�� Lee was saying. 

��Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter 
have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,�� 
said Lupin. 

 ��At least he��s still alive!�� muttered Ron. 

��We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid�� �C all three of them gasped, 
and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence -��well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has

��318ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a 
'Support Harry Potter' party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we 
believe, on the run.�� 

��I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you��ve got a sixteen-foot-high half 
brother?�� asked Lee. 

��It would tend to give you an edge,�� agreed Lupin gravely. ��May I just add that while we here 
at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid��s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry��s 
supporters against following Hagrid��s lead. 'Support Harry Potter' parties are unwise in the present 
climate.�� 

��Indeed they are, Romulus,�� said Lee, ��so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion 
to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now let��s move to news 
concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the 
Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about 
him, I��d like to introduce a new correspondent. Rodent?��

 ����Rodent��?�� said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried out together,

 ��Fred!��

 ��No �C is it George?��

 ��It��s Fred, I think,�� said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, 

 ��I��m not being ��Rodent��, no way, I told you I wanted to be ��Rapier���ɶ�ϸ���Ľ���!�� 

��Oh, all right then, Rapier, could you please give us your take on the various stories we��ve been 
hearing about the Chief Death Eater?�� 

��Yes, River, I can,�� said Fred. ��As our listeners will know, unless they��ve taken refuge at the 
bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who��s strategy of remaining in the 
shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are 
genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.�� 

��Which suits him, of course,�� said Kingsley. ��The air of mystery is creating more terror than 
actually showing himself.�� 

��Agreed,�� said Fred. ��So, people, let��s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without 
inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill people with a 
single glance from his eyes. That��s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test, check whether the thing

��319ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

that��s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it��s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is YouKnow-
Who, that��s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.�� 

For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing. He could feel the weight of tension 
leaving him.

 ��And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?�� asked Lee. 

��Well, who wouldn��t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he��s been putting in?�� 
asked Fred. ��Point is, people, don��t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he��s out of the 
country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn��t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape 
confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don��t count on him being a long way away if 
you��re planning to take any risks. I never thought I��d hear myself say it, but safety first!�� 

��Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,�� said Lee. ��Listeners, that brings us to the 
end of another Potterwatch. We don��t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you 
can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials. The next password will be ��Mad-Eye��. 
Keep each other safe, Keep faith. Good night.�� 

The radio��s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry 
had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting 
Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep.

 ��Good, eh?�� said Ron happily.

 ��Brilliant,�� said Harry.

 ��It��s so brave of them,�� sighed Hermione admiringly. ��If they were found ...��

 ��Well, they keep on the move, don��t they?�� said Ron. ��Like us.�� 

��But did you hear what Fred said?�� asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his 
thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. ��He��s abroad! He��s still looking for 

the Wand, I knew it!��

 ��Harry����

 ��Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol �C��

 ��HARRY, NO!��

 ����demort��s after the Elder Wand!�� 

��The name��s Taboo!�� Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the

tent. ��I told you, Harry, I told you, we can��t say it anymore �C we��ve got to put the protection back 
around us �C quickly �C it��s how they find �C�� 

But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and 
begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer, rough, excited voices. Ron pulled 
the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it. Their lamps went out.

 ��Come out of there with your hands up!�� came a rasping voice through the darkness. ��We know 
you��re in there! You��ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don��t care who we curse!��

Chapter Twenty-Three 
Malfoy Manor 


Harry looked around at the other two, now 
in the darkness. He saw Hermione point her 
toward the outside, but into his face; there was a 
of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable 
could feel his face swelling rapidly under his 
heavy footfalls surrounded him. 

"Get up, vermin." Unknown hands dragged 
roughly off the ground, before he could stop 


mere outlines 
wand, not 
bang, a burst 
to see. He 
hands as 

Harry 
them, 

someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry clutched at 
his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and 
puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits 
through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent, all he 
could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside 
too. 

"Get - off - her!" Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh, Ron 
grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, "No! Leave him alone, leave him alone!" 

"Your boyfriend's going to have worse than that done to him if he's on my list," said the 
horribly familiar, rasping voice. "Delicious girl... what a treat ... I do enjoy the softness of the 
skin." 

Harry's stomach turned over. He knew who this was, Fenrit Greyback, the werewolf who was 

permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery.

 "Search the tent!" said another voice. 

Harry was thrown face down onto the ground. A thud told him that Ron had been cast down 
beside him. They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the 
tent as they searched. 

"Now, let's see who we've got," said Greyback's gloating voice from overhead, and Harry was 
rolled over onto his back. A beam of wand light fell onto his face and Greyback laughed.

��322ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I'll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you, ugly?"

 Harry did not answer immediately. 

"I said," repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double 
over in pain. "what happened to you?"

 "Stung." Harry muttered. "Been Stung." 

 "Yeah, looks like it." said a second voice.

 "What��s your name?" snarled Greyback.

 "Dudley." said Harry.

 "And your first name?" 

 "I - Vernon. Vernon Dudley." 

"Check the list, Scabior." said Greyback, and Harry head him move sideways to look down at 

Ron, instead. "And what about you, ginger?" 

 "Stan Shunpike." said Ron. 

"Like 'ell you are." said the man called Scabior. "We know Stan Shunpike, 'e's put a bit of work 

our way."

 There was another thud.

 "I'b Bardy," said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. "Bardy Weasley." 

"A Weasley?" rasped Greyback. "So you're related to blood traitors even if you're not a 

Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little friend ...�� The relish in his voice made Harry's flesh crawl.

 "Easy, Greyback." said Scabior over the jeering of the others.

 "Oh, I'm not going to bite just yet. We'll see if she��s a bit quicker at remembering her name than 

Barny. Who are you, girly?

 "Penelope Clearwater." said Hermione. She sounded terrified, but convincing.

 "What's your blood status?" 

 "Half-Blood." said Hermione. 

"Easy enough to check," said Scabior. "But the 'ole lot of 'em look like they could still be 

'ogwarts age -" 

 "We'b lebt," said Ron. 

"Left, 'ave you, ginger?" said Scabior. "And you decided to go camping? And you thought, just 

for a laugh, you'd use the Dark Lords name?" 

��323ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Nod a laugh," said Ron. "Aggiden." 

 "Accident?" There was more jeering laughter. 

"You know who used to like using the Dark Lord's name, Weasley?" growled Greyback, "The 
Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?"

 "Doh." 

"Well, they don't show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name's been Tabooed. A few Order 

members have been tracked that way. We'll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!" 

 Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed him down into a sitting 
position, then started binding him back-to-back with other people. Harry was still half blind, barely 
able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When at last the man tying them had walked 
away, Harry whispered to the other prisoners. 

 "Anyone still got a wand?" 

 "No." said Ron and Hermione from either side of him.

 "This is all my fault. I said the name. I'm sorry -" 

 "Harry?" 

It was a new, but familiar voice. And it came from directly behind Harry, from the person tied 
to Hermione's left.

 "Dean?" 
"It is you! If they find out who they've got! They're Snatchers, they're only looking for truants��
����to sell for gold -" 

"Not a bad little haul for one night." Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed boots (boot 
with nails placed in the sole for protection) marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes 
from inside the tent. "A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and these truants. You checked their names 
on the list yet, Scabior?" he roared.

 "Yeah. There's no Vernon Dudley on 'ere, Greyback."

 "Interesting," said Greyback. "That's interesting." 

He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infinitesimal gap left between his 
swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers, with pointed brown teeth and 
sores in the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where 
Dumbledore had died, of dirt, sweat, and blood. 

��324ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"So you aren't wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different name? What 

house were you in at Hogwarts?" 

 "Slytherin," said Harry automatically. 

"Funny 'ow they all thinks we wants to 'ear that." leered Scabior out of the shadows. "But none 
of 'em can tell us where the common room is." 

"It's in the dungeons." said Harry clearly. "You enter through the wall. It's full of skulls and 
stuff and it��s under the lake, so the light's all green,"

 There was a short pause. 

"Well, well, looks like we really 'ave caught a little Slytherin." said Scabior. "Good for you, 

Vernon, 'cause there ain't a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who's your father?" 

"He works at the Ministry," Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would collapse with the 
smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual 
appearance before the game was up in any case. "Department of Magical Accidents and 
Catastrophes."

 "You know what, Greyback," said Scabior. "I think there is a Dudley in there." 

 Harry could barely breathe. Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this? 

"Well, well." said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous 
voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had just indeed just attacked and bound 
the son of a Ministry Official. Harry's heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he 
would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it. 

"If you're telling the truth, ugly, you've got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect 

your father'll reward us just for picking you up." 

 "But," said Harry, his mouth bone dry, "if you just let us -" 

 "Hey!" came a shout from inside the tent. "Look at this. Greyback!" 

A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver to the light of their 
wands. They had found Gryffindor's sword. 

"Ve-e-ery nice," said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion. "Oh, very nice 
indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?" 

"It's my father's," Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for Greyback to see the 
name etched just below the hilt. "We borrowed it to cut firewood -" 

��325ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"'ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!" 

As Scabior said it, Harry's scar, which was stretched tight across his distended forehead, burned 
savagely. More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a 
grim fortress, jet-black and forbidding, Voldemort's thoughts had suddenly become Razor-Sharp 
again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose ... 

So close ... So close ... 

With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort's thoughts, pulling himself back 
to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook in the darkness, listening to Greyback 
and Scabior. 

"'Hermione Granger," Scabior was saying, "the Mudblood who is known to be traveling with 
'arry Potter." 

Harry's scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present, nor to 
slip into Voldemort's mind. He heard the creak of Greyback's boots as he crouched down, in front 
of Hermione.

 "You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you."

 "It isn't! It isn't me!"

 Hermione's terrified squeak was as good as a confession. 

"... known to be traveling with Harry Potter," repeated Greyback quietly.

 A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry's scar was exquisitely painful, but he struggled with 
all his strength against the pull of Voldemort's thoughts. It had never been so important to remain 
in his own right mind. 

"Well, this changed things, doesn't it?" whispered Greyback. Nobody spoke. Harry sensed the 
gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione's arm trembling against his. Greyback got 
up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching down again to stare closely at his 
misshapen features. 

"What's that on your forehead, Vernon?" he asked softly, his breath foul in Harry's nostrils as 
he pressed a filthy finger to the taught scar. 

"Don't touch it!�� Harry yelled; he could not stop himself, he thought he might be sick from the 
pain of it.

 "I thought you wore glasses, Potter?" breathed Greyback.

��326ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I found glasses!" yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background. "There was glasses 
in the tent, Greyback, wait -" 

And seconds later Harry's glasses had been rammed back onto his face. The Snatchers were 
closing in now, peering at him.

 "It is!" rasped Greyback. "We've caught Potter!" 

They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. Harry, still fighting to 
remain present in his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say. Fragmented visions were 
breaking across the surface of his mind - 

-He was hiding around the high walls of the black fortress - 

 No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger - 

-looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower - 

 He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices - 

 -Time to fly ... 

 "... To the Ministry?" 

"To hell with the Ministry." growled Greyback. "They'll take the credit, and we won't get a look 
in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who." 

 "Will you summon 'im? 'ere?" said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified. 

"No," snarled Greyback, "I haven't got -they say he's using the Malfoy's place as a base. We'll 

take the boy there." 

Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort. The werewolf might be 
allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort's inner circle 
were branded with the Dark Mark, Greyback had not been granted this highest honor. 

Harry��s scar seared again �C 

�C and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the windows at the very top of the tower �C 

��... completely sure it��s him? 'Cause if it ain��t, Greyback, we��re dead.�� 

��Who��s in charge here?�� roared Greyback, covering his moment of inadequacy. ��I say that��s 
Potter, and him plus his wand, that��s two hundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you��re too 
gutless to come along, any of you, it��s all for me, and with any luck, I��ll get the girl thrown in (add 
in something for free, give something free of charge)!��

skeletal figure was just visible through it, curled beneath a blanket. Dead, or sleeping ... ? 

��All right!�� said Scabior. ��All right, we��re in! And what about the rest of 'em, Greyback, what��ll 
we do with 'em?�� 

��Might as well take the lot. We��ve got two Mudbloods, that��s another ten Galleons. Give me the 
sword as well. If they��re rubies, that��s another small fortune right there.�� 

The prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Hermione��s breathing, fast and 
terrified. 

��Grab hold and make it tight. I��ll do Potter!�� said Greyback, seizing a fistful of Harry��s hair; 
Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. ��On three! One �C two �C three �C�� 

They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry struggled, trying to throw off 
Greyback��s hand, but it was hopeless, Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on 
either side; he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of him his 
scar seared more painfully still �C 

�C as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor 
inside the cell-like room �C 
The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. Harry��s eyes, still 
puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what 
looked like a long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had not happened 
yet, Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew, for he was fighting to resist the vision, in some 
strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. How long it would take Voldemort to get to this 
place, once he knew that Harry was here, was another matter.

 One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them.

 ��How do we get in? They��re locked, Greyback, I can��t �C blimey!�� 

He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting, twisting itself out of the abstract 
furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing voice. ��State your 

purpose!��

 ��We��ve got Potter!�� Greyback roared triumphantly. ��We��ve captured Harry Potter!��

 The gates swung open. 

��Come on!�� said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up 

the drive, between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above

him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by 
Greyback; now he was staggering along sideways, tied back-to-back (one right after another, in 
immediate succession) to the four other prisoner. Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his 
scar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he 
knew yet that Harry was caught.. 

The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, eyes opening 
in a skull of a face. The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon him, upon Voldemort, and 
then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. 

��So, you have come. I thought you would ... one day. But your journey was pointless. I never 
had it.��

 ��You lie!�� 

As Voldemort��s anger throbbed inside him, Harry��s scar threatened to burst with pain, and he 
wrenched his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed 
over gravel. 

 Light spilled out over all of them.

 ��What is this?�� said a woman��s cold voice.

 ��We��re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!�� rasped Greyback.

 ��Who are you?�� 

��You know me!�� There was resentment in the werewolf��s voice. ��Fenrit Greyback! We��ve 
caught Harry Potter!�� 

Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other prisoners to 
shuffle around too. 

��I know 'e��s swollen, ma'am, but it��s 'im!�� piped up Scabior. ��If you look a bit closer, you��ll see 
'is scar. And this 'ere, see the girl? The Mudblood who��s been traveling around with 'im, ma'am. 
There��s no doubt it��s 'im, and we��ve got 'is wand as well! 'Ere, ma��am �C�� 

Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face. Scabior 

thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows.

 ��Bring them in,�� she said. 

Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with 

portraits.

��329ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Follow me,�� said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. ��My son, Draco, is home for his 
Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.�� 

The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost closed Harry 
could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more 
portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble 
fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers.

 ��What is this?�� 

The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry��s ears. He was 
panicking now. He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out 
Voldemort��s thoughts, though his scar was still burning. 

��They say they��ve got Potter,�� said Narcissa��s cold voice. ��Draco, come here.�� Harry did not 
dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely; a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from 
an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.

 Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath the chandelier.

 ��Well, boy?�� rasped the werewolf. 

Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled����
����װ�� frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since 
leaving Grimmauld Place. 

His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione��s jinx. His black hair 
reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was 
he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses. He resolved not to 
speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the 
latter approached. 

��Well, Draco?�� said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. 

��Is it? Is it Harry Potter?�� 

��I can��t �C I can��t be sure,�� said Draco. He was keeping his distance from Greyback, and seemed 
as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him.

 ��But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!��

 Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.

 ��Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv �C��

��330ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Now, we won��t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope Mr. Malfoy?�� said Greyback 
menacingly. 

��Of course not, of course not!�� said Lucius impatiently. He approached Harry himself, came so 
close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen 
eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of 
a cage. 

 ��What did you do to him?�� Lucius asked Greyback. ��How did he get into this state?��

 ��That wasn��t us.�� 

��Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,�� said Lucius.

 His gray eyes raked Harry��s forehead. 

��There��s something there,�� he whispered. ��it could be the scar, stretched tight... Draco, come 
here, look properly! What do you think?�� 

Harry saw Draco��s face up close now, right beside his father��s. They were extraordinarily alike, 
except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, Draco��s expression was full of 
reluctance, even fear. 

��I don��t know,�� he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood 
watching. 

��We had better be certain, Lucius,�� Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, clear voice. 
��Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord ... They say this is his...�� �C she 
was looking closely at the blackthorn wand �C ��but it does not resemble Ollivander��s description... 
If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing ... Remember what he did to Rowle 
and Dolohov?�� 

��What about the Mudblood, then?�� growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown off his feet as 
the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light fell on Hermione 
instead. 

��Wait,�� said Narcissa sharply. ��Yes �C yes, she was in Madam Malkin��s with Potter! I saw her 

picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isn��t it the Granger girl?��

 ��I ... maybe ... yeah.�� 

��But then, that��s the Weasley boy!�� shouted Lucius, striding around the bound prisoners to face 

Ron. ��It��s them, Potter��s friends �C Draco, look at him, isn��t it Arthur Weasley��s son, what��s his

��331ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

name �C?��

 ��Yeah,�� said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. ��It could be.�� 

The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the sound of the voice 

wound Harry��s fear to an even higher pitch.

 ��What is this? What��s happened, Cissy?�� 

Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry��s right, staring at 

Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes,

 ��But surely,�� she said quietly, ��this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?�� 

��Yes, yes, it��s Granger!�� cried Lucius, ��And beside her, we think, Potter! Potter and his friends, 

caught at last!�� 

��Potter?�� shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry. ��Are you sure? 
Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!�� She dragged back her left sleeve, Harry saw 
the Dark Mark burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to 
summon her beloved master. 

��I was about to call him!�� said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon Bellatrix��s wrist, 
preventing her from touching the Mark. ��I shall summon him, Bella. Potter has been brought to my 
house, and it is therefore upon my authority �C�� 

��Your authority!�� she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. ��You lost your 

authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!��

 ��This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy �C�� 

��Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,�� interjected Greyback, ��but it��s us that caught Potter, and 

it��s us that��ll be claiming the gold �C�� 

��Gold!�� laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her brother-in-law, her free hand 
groping in her pocket for her wand. ��Take your gold, filthy scavenger, what do I want with gold? I 
seek only the honor of his �C of �C�� 

She stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something Harry could not see. Jubilant at her 

capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve �C 

 ��STOP!�� shrieked Bellatrix, ��Do not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now!�� 

Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix strode out of Harry��s 

limited line of vision. 

��332ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��What is that?�� he heard her say.

 ��Sword,�� grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher.

 ��Give it to me.��

 ��It��s not yours, missus, it��s mine, I reckon I found it.�� 

There was a bang and a flash of red light; Harry knew that the Snatcher had been Stunned. 
There was a roar of anger from his fellows, Scabior drew his wand. 

 ��What d��you think you��re playing at, woman?��

 ��Stupefy!�� she screamed, ��Stupefy!�� 

They were no match for her, even thought there were four of them against one of her, she was a 
witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience. They fell where they stood, all 
except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms outstretched. Out of the 
corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor 
gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen. 

��Where did you get this sword?�� she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his 
unresisting grip. 

��How dare you?�� he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze 
up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. ��Release me, woman!�� 

��Where did you find this sword?�� she repeated, brandishing it in his face, ��Snape sent it to my 
vault in Gringotts!��

 ��It was in their tent,�� rasped Greyback. ��Release me, I say!�� 

She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary to approach 
her. He prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved nails clutching its back. 

��Draco, move this scum outside,�� said Bellatrix, indicating the unconscious men. ��If you 
haven��t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.��

 ��Don��t you dare speak to Draco like �C�� said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix screamed. 

��Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious 
problem!�� 

She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. Then she turned to 
look at the silent prisoners. 

��If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,�� she muttered, more to herself than to the others.

��333ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself... But if he finds out ... I must ... I must 
know... ��

 She turned back to her sister again. 

��The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do!�� 

��This is my house, Bella, you don��t give orders in my �C�� 

��Do it! You have no idea of the danger we��re in!�� shrieked Bellatrix. She looked frightening, 

mad; a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet. 

Narcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf. 

��Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.�� 

��Wait,�� said Bellatrix sharply. ��All except... except for the Mudblood.�� 

Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure. 

��No!�� shouted Ron. ��You can have me, keep me!�� 

Bellatrix hit him across the face, the blow echoed around the room. 

��If she dies under questioning, I��ll take you next,�� she said. ��Blood traitor is next to Mudblood 
in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more 
to them �C yet.�� 

She threw Greyback��s wand back to him, then took a short silver knife from under her robes. 
She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the 
room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door, into a dark 
passageway, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force. 

��Reckon she��ll let me have a bit of the girl when she��s finished with her?�� Greyback crooned as 
he forced them along the corridor. ��I��d say I��ll get a bite or two, wouldn��t you, ginger?�� 

Harry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep flight of stairs, still tied back-toback 
and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. At the bottom was a heavy 
door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room 
and left them in total darkness. The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away 
before there was a terrible, drawn out scream from directly above them. 

��HERMIONE!�� Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying 
them together, so that Harry staggered. ��HERMIONE!�� 

��Be quiet!�� Harry said. ��Shut up. Ron, we need to work out a way �C��

��334ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��HERMIONE! HERMIONE!�� 

��We need a plan, stop yelling �C we need to get these ropes off �C�� 

��Harry?�� came a whisper through the darkness. ��Ron? Is that you?�� 

Ron stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry saw a shadow 
moving closer. 

��Harry? Ron?�� 

��Luna?�� 

��Yes, it��s me! Oh no, I didn��t want you to be caught!�� 

��Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?�� said Harry. 

��Oh yes, I expect so. There��s an old nail we use if we need to break anything... Just a 
moment ...�� 

Hermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear Bellatrix screaming too, but her 
words were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, ��HERMIONE! HERMIONE!�� 

��Mr. Ollivander?�� Harry could hear Luna saying. ��Mr. Ollivander, have you got the nail? If you 
just move over a little bit ... I think it was beside the water jug.�� 

She was back within seconds. 

��You��ll need to stay still,�� she said. 

Harry could feel her digging at the rope��s tough fibers to work the knots free. From upstairs they 

heard Bellatrix��s voice. 

��I��m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where?�� 

��We found it �C we found it �C PLEASE!�� Hermione screamed again; Ron struggled harder than 

ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry��s wrist. 

��Ron, please stay still!�� Luna whispered. ��I can��t see what I��m doing �C�� 

��My pocket!�� said Ron, ��In my pocket, there��s a Deluminator, and it��s full of light!�� 

A few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the Deluminator had sucked 
from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar. Unable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung 
there, like tiny suns, flooding the underground room with light. Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her 
white face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the 
corner. Craning around, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners, Dean and Griphook the goblin, 
who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans.

��335ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Oh, that��s much easier, thanks, Ron,�� said Luna, and she began hacking at their bindings again. 

��Hello, Dean!�� 

From above came Bellatrix��s voice. 

��You��re lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell 

the truth, tell the truth!�� 

Another terrible scream. 

��HERMIONE!�� 

��What else did you take? What else have you got? Tel me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you 

through with this knife!�� 

��There!�� 

Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running around the 
cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor. Dean, his face bruised and bloody, 
said ��Thanks�� to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank onto the cellar floor, looking 
groggy and disoriented, many welts across his swarthy face. 

Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand. 

��There��s no way out, Ron,�� said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. ��The cellar is completely 
escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he��s tried everything.�� 

Hermione was screaming again. The sound went through Harry like physical pain. Barely 
conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the 
walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless. 

��What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!�� 

Hermione��s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the 
walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrid��s pouch from around his neck and 
groped inside it. He pulled out Dumbledore��s Snitch and shook it, hoping for he did not know what 

�C nothing happened �C he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they were lifeless �C the 
mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of brightest blue �C 
Dumbledore��s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. 
��Help us!�� he yelled at it in mad desperation. ��We��re in the cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us!�� 
The eye blinked and was gone. 
Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard of mirror this way and

��336ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs 
Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was bellowing, ��HERMIONE! 
HERMIONE!�� 

��How did you get into my vault?�� they heard Bellatrix scream. ��Did that dirty little goblin in the 
cellar help you?�� 

��We only met him tonight!�� Hermione sobbed. ��We��ve never been inside your vault... It isn��t 
the real sword! It��s a copy, just a copy!�� 

��A copy?�� screeched Bellatrix. ��Oh, a likely story!�� 

��But we can find out easily!�� came Lucius��s voice. ��Draco, fetch the goblin, he can tell us 

whether the sword is real or not!�� 

Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor. 

��Griphook,�� he whispered into the goblin��s pointed ear, ��you must tell them that sword��s a fake, 
they mustn��t know it��s the real one, Griphook, please �C�� 

He could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps; next moment, Draco��s shaking voice 
spoke from behind the door. 

��Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don��t try anything, or I��ll kill you!�� 

They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Deluminator and the lights 
whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar��s darkness. The door flew open; Malfoy marched 
inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He seized the little goblin by the arm 
and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut and at the same 
moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar. 

Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket, 

revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst. 

��DOB �C !�� 

Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified at his mistake. 
Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead, Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix. 

Dobby��s enormous, tennis-ball shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his feet to the 
tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petrified. 

��Harry Potter,�� he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, ��Dobby has come to rescue you.�� 

��But how did you �C?��

��337ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

An awful scream drowned Harry��s words, Hermione was being tortured again. He cut to the 

essentials. 

��You can Disapparate out of this cellar?�� he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears flapping. 

��And you can take humans with you?�� 

Dobby nodded again. 

��Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander, and take them �C take them 

to �C�� 

��Bill and Fleur��s,�� said Ron. ��Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth!�� 

The elf nodded for a third time. 

��And then come back,�� said Harry. ��Can you do that, Dobby?�� 

��Of course, Harry Potter,�� whispered the little elf. He hurried over to Mr. Ollivander, who 

appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the wandmaker��s hands in his own, then held out 

the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved. 

��Harry, we want to help you!�� Luna whispered. 

��We can��t leave you here,�� said Dean. 

��Go, both of you! We��ll see you at Bill and Fleur��s.�� 

As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds he looked down, not 

upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully. 

��Kill me, then. Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will not bring you what you seek. 
There is so much you do not understand...�� 

He felt Voldemort��s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out, returning to the cellar 

and the horror of his own present. 

��Go!�� Harry beseeched to Luna and Dean. ��Go! We��ll follow, just go!�� 

They caught hold of the elf��s outstretched fingers. There was another loud crack, and Dobby, 
Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished. 

��What was that?�� shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. ��Did you hear that? What was 
that noise in the cellar?�� 

Harry and Ron stared at each other. 

��Draco �C no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!�� 

Footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry knew that the people in the

��338ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar. 

��We��re going to have to try and tackle him,�� he whispered to Ron. They had no choice. The 
moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. ��Leave 
the lights on,�� Harry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they 
backed against the wall on either side of it. 

��Stand back,�� came Wormtail��s voice. ��Stand away from the door. I��m coming in.�� The door 
flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light 
from the three miniature suns floating in midair. Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon 
him. Ron seized Wormtail��s wand arm and forced it upwards. Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, 
muffling his voice. Silently they struggled, Wormtail��s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed 
around Harry��s throat. 

��What is it, Wormtail?�� called Lucius Malfoy from above. 

��Nothing!�� Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail��s wheezy voice. ��All fine!�� 

Harry could barely breathe. 

��You��re going to kill me?�� Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. ��After I 
saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!�� 

The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it. He wrenched himself free, astonished, 
keeping his hand over Wormtail��s mouth. He saw the rat-like man��s small watery eyes widen with 
fear and surprise. He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, 
merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo 
that moment of weakness. 

��And we��ll have that,�� whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail��s wand from his other hand. 

Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew��s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid from Harry��s face to 
something else. His own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat. 

��No �C�� 

Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. The 
silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and 
useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was 
being strangled before their eyes. 

��No!��

��339ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the crushing metal 
fingers from around Wormtail��s throat, but it was no use. Pettigrew was turning blue. 

��Relashio!�� said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew 
dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. 
Wormtail��s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and was still. 

Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail��s body on the floor behind them, ran 
up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room. Cautiously they 
crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, which was ajar. Now they had a clear 
view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who was holding Gryffindor��s sword in his long-
fingered hands. Hermione was lying at Bellatrix��s feet. She was barely stirring. 

��Well?�� Bellatrix said to Griphook. ��Is it the true sword?�� 

Harry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar. 

��No,�� said Griphook. ��It is a fake.�� 

��Are you sure?�� panted Bellatrix. ��Quite sure?�� 

��Yes,�� said the goblin. 

Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it. 

��Good,�� she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the 
goblin��s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him aside. ��And now,�� she said in 

a voice that burst with triumph, ��we call the Dark Lord!�� 

And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark Mark. 

At once, Harry��s scar felt as though it had split open again. His true surroundings vanished, He 
was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was 
enraged at the summons he felt �C he had warned them, he had told them to summon him for 
nothing less than Potter. If they were mistaken ... 

��Kill me, then!�� demanded the old man. ��You will not win, you cannot win! That wand will 
never, ever be yours �C�� 

And Voldemort��s fury broke. A burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body 
was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort returned to the window, his 
wrath barely controllable. They would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling 
him back.

��340ҳ��

��And I think,�� said Bellatrix��s voice, ��we can dispose of the Mudblood. Greyback, take her if 

you want her.�� 

��NOOOOOOOOOOOO!�� 

Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around, shocked; she turned her wand to 

face Ron instead �C 

��Expelliarmus!�� he roared, pointing Wormtail��s wand at Bellatrix, and hers flew into the air and 
was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, Draco and Greyback wheeled 
about; Harry yelled, ��Stupefy!�� and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto the hearth. Jets of light flew 
from Draco��s, Narcissa��s, and Greyback��s wands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind 
a sofa to avoid them. 

��STOP OR SHE DIES! 

Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was supporting Hermione, who 
seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to Hermione��s throat. 

��Drop your wands,�� she whispered. ��Drop them, or we��ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!�� 

Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtail��s wand. Harry straightened up, still holding Bellatrix��s. 

��I said, drop them!�� she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione��s throat, Harry saw beads 
of blood appear there. 

��All right!�� he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix��s wand onto the floor at his feet, Ron did the 
same with Wormtail��s. Both raised their hands to shoulder height. 

��Good!�� she leered. ��Draco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter! Your death 
approaches!�� 

Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel Voldemort flying 
through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to 
Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out. 

��Now,�� said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands. ��Cissy, I think we 
ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure 
the Dark Lord will not begrudge��ϧ 
you the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.�� 

At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them looked upward in 
time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to 
fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw herself aside with a scream.

��341ҳ��

The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of 
Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal 
flew in all directions; Draco doubled over, his hands covering his bloody face. 

As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance, He leapt over an 
armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco��s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and 
yelled, ��Stupefy!�� The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and 
then smashed to the ground. 

As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her feet, her hair 

flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway. 

��Dobby!�� she screamed and even Bellatrix froze. ��You! You dropped the chandelier �C?�� 

The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. 

��You must not hurt Harry Potter,�� he squeaked. 

��Kill him, Cissy!�� shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and Narcissa��s wand too 
flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. 

��You dirty little monkey!�� bawled Bellatrix. ��How dare you take a witch��s wand, how dare you 
defy your masters?�� 

��Dobby has no master!�� squealed the elf. ��Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save 
Harry Potter and his friends!�� 

Harry��s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had moments, seconds before 
Voldemort was with them. 

��Ron, catch �C and GO!�� he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent down to tug 
Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the 
sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby��s hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate. 

As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale, frozen 
figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron��s hair, and a blue of flying silver, 
as Bellatrix��s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing. 

Bill and Fleur��s ... Shell Cottage ... Bill and Fleur��s ... 

He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the destination 
and hope that it would suffice to take him there. The pain in his forehead pierced him, and the 
weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of Gryffindor��s sword bumping

��342ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

against his back, Dobby��s hand jerked in his; he wondered whether the elf was trying to take 
charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers, to indicate that that 
was fine with them. 

And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees, relinquished Dobby��s 

hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground. 

��Are you all right?�� he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. 

Harry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short way away 
under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it. 

��Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?�� he whispered, clutching the two wands he had brought from the 
Malfoys��, ready to fight if he needed to. ��Have we come to the right place? Dobby?�� 

He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. 

��DOBBY!�� 

The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and Harry looked 
down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf��s heaving chest. 

��Dobby �C no �C HELP!�� Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. 
��HELP!�� 

He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared 
about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby��s front, and that he had stretched out his 
own arms to Harry with a look of supplication (earnest request). Harry caught him and laid him 
sideways on the cool grass. 

��Dobby, no, don��t die, don��t die �C�� 

The elf��s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. 

��Harry ... Potter ...�� 

And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than 
great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.

Chapter Twenty-Four 
The Wandmaker 


It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for 


an instant 
Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore��s body at 

the foot of 
the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he 

was staring at 
a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by 

Bellatrix��s 
silver knife. Harry��s voice was still saying, 

��Dobby... 
Dobby...�� even though he knew that the elf had 

gone where 
he could not call him back. 

After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were 
Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. ��Hermione,�� he said 
suddenly. ��Where is she?�� 

��Ron��s taken her inside,�� said Bill. ��She��ll be all right.�� Harry looked back down at Dobby. He 
stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf��s body, then dragged off his own 
jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket. 

The sea was rushing against the rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it while the others 
talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the 
injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making sugegstions 
about bury the elf. Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he 
gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed 
as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left 
behind at the Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry��s grief for Dobby seemed to 
diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean. 

��I want to do it properly,�� were the first words of which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. 
��Not by magic. Have you got a spade?�� And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging 
the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug 
with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of 
his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives. 

His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned

��344ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him 
to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was 
consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned 
Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out... though Dumbledore, of course, would have said 
that it was love. 

On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming (include,��...�������� 
) 
his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his 
own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys�� 
returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the 
darkness... 

The steady rhythm of his arms beat time������ with his thoughts. Hallows... Horcruxes... 
Hallows... Horcruxes... yet no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had 
snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been slapped awake again. 

Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, 
and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why... 

And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy... 
Dumbledore had foreseen that... How much more had he known? 

Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he 
was rejoined by Ron and Dean. ��How��s Hermione?�� 

��Better,�� said Ron. ��Fleur��s looking after her.�� 

Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect 
grave with his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with 
spades of their own and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. 

Harry wrapped the elf more snuggly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped 
off his shoes and socks, which he placed on the elf��s bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which 
Harry placed carefully upon Dobby��s head, muffling his batlike ears. ��We should close his eyes.��

 Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, 
Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to 
be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; 
Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur��s coats,

��345ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf��s eyelids, sliding them over his 
glassy stare. ��There,�� she said softly. ��Now he could be sleeping.�� 

Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, 
then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break 
down as he remembered Dumbledore��s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the 
Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore��s achievements, the stateliness of 
the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay 
between bushes in a roughly dug hole. ��I think we ought to say something,�� piped up Luna. ��I��ll 
go first, shall I?�� 

And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. ��Thank 
you so much Dobby for rescuing me from that cellar. It��s so unfair that you had to die when you 
were so good and brave. I��ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you��re happy now.�� 

She turned and looked expectingly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, 

��yeah... thanks Dobby.�� 

��Thanks,�� muttered Dean. 

Harry swallowed. ��Good bye Dobby,�� he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it 
all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell 
neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. 

��D��ya mind if I stay here a moment?�� He asked the others. 

They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all 
traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. 

He looked around. There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking 
the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place 
where Dobby��s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He 
had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to 
remember wrenching them out of someone��s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt 
friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. 

Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock��s surface. He knew 
that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark 
the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read, HERE

LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. 

He looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar still prickling a 
little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken 
shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. 

They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused 
upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood 
burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in 
the doorway, listening. 

��... lucky that Ginny��s on holiday. If she��d been at Hogwarts they could have taken her before 
we reached her. Now we know she��s safe too.�� He looked around and saw Harry standing there. 
��I��ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,�� he explained. ��Moved them to Muriel��s. The Death 
Eaters know Ron��s with you now, they��re bound to target the family �C don��t apologize,�� he added 
at the sight of Harry��s expression. ��It was always a matter of time, Dad��s been saying so for 
months. We��re the biggest blood traitor family there is.�� 

��How are they protected?�� asked Harry. 

��Fidelius Charm. Dad��s Secret-Keeper. And we��ve done it on this cottage too; I��m Secret-
Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that��s hardly the most important thing now. Once 
Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we��ll move them to Muriel��s too. There isn��t much 
room here, but she��s got plenty. Griphook��s legs are on the mend. Fleur��s given him Skele-Gro, we 
could probably move them in an hour or -�� 

��No,�� Harry said and Bill looked startled. ��I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It��s 
important.�� He heard the authority of his own voice, the conviction, the voice of purpose that had 
come to him as he dug Dobby��s grave. All of their faces were turned toward him looking puzzled. 

��I��m going to wash,�� Harry told Bill looking down at his hands still covered with mud and 
Dobby��s blood. ��Then I��ll need to see them, straight away.�� He walked into the little kitchen, to 
the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink 
and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to him in the 
dark garden... 

Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he 
had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come.

��347ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it. 

Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the 
murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this 
dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all. 

And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too. Harry understood 
and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling him one thing, his brain quite another. The 
Dumbledore in Harry��s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers, pressed together 
as if in prayer. 

You gave Ron the Deluminator... You understood him... You gave him a way back... 

And you understood Wormtail too... You knew there was a bit of regret there, somewhere... 

And if you knew them... What did you know about me, Dumbledore? 

Am I meant to know but not to seek? Did you know how hard I��d feel that? Is that why you made 
it this difficult? So I��d have time to work that out? 

Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold ray of dazzling sun 
was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily 
surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned to the hall, and as he 
did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and then flashed across his mind, swift as the reflection of a 
dragonfly over water, the outline of a building he knew extremely well.

 Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs. 

 ��I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,�� Harry said.

 ��No,�� said Fleur. ��You will 'ave to wait, 'Arry. Zey are both too tired �C�� 

��I��m sorry,�� he said without heat, ��but it can��t wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately �C and 
separately. It��s urgent.�� 

��Harry, what the hell��s going on?�� asked Bill. ��You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a 
half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she��s been tortured, and Ron��s just refused to tell 
me anything �C�� 

��We can��t tell you what we��re doing,�� said Harry flatly. ��You��re in the Order, Bill, you know 
Dumbledore left us a mission. We��re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.�� 

Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at Harry. His deeply 
scarred face was hard to read. Finally, Bill said, ��All right. Who do you want to talk to first?��

��348ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time left; now was 

the moment to decide, Horcruxes or Hallows.

 ��Griphook,�� Harry said. ��I��ll speak to Griphook first.��

 His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle.

 ��Up here, then,�� said Bill, leading the way.

 Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back. 

��I need you two as well!�� he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking��� 
, half 
concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room.

 They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved. 

��How are you?�� Harry asked Hermione. ��You were amazing �C coming up with that story when 

she was hurting you like that �C��

 Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed squeeze.

 ��What are we doing now, Harry?�� he asked. 

 ��You��ll see. Come on.�� 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. Three doors 

led off it. 

��In here,�� said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur��s room, it too had a view of the sea, 
now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the 
spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the chair beside 
the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm. 

Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully upon the bed. Griphook 

grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all.

 ��I��m sorry to take you out of bed,�� said Harry. ��How are your legs?��

 ��Painful,�� replied the goblin. ��But mending.�� 

He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look, half truculent (cruel; 
harsh), half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin��s sallow skin, his long thin fingers, his black eyes. 
Fleur had removed his shoes, His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but not by 
much. His domed head was much bigger than a human��s.

 ��You probably don��t remember �C�� Harry began. 

��-that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you ever visited

��349ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Gringotts?�� said Griphook. ��I remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very 
famous.�� 

Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up���� 
. Harry��s scar was still 
prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time 
was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his 
request, the goblin broke the silence. 

��You buried the elf,�� he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous (bitter, resentful). ��I watched 

you from the window of the bedroom next door.��

 ��Yes,�� said Harry.

 Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes.

 ��You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.��

 ��In what way?�� asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently.

 ��You dug the grave.��

 ��So?�� 

Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a 
Muggle, but it did not matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby��s grave or not. He 
gathered himself for the attack. ��Griphook, I need to ask �C��

 ��You also rescued a goblin.��

 ��What?��

 ��You brought me here. Saved me.��

 ��Well, I take it you��re not sorry?�� said Harry a little impatiently. 

��No, Harry Potter,�� said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his 
chin, ��but you are a very odd wizard.��

 ��Right,�� said Harry. ��Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.�� 

The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as though he had 

never seen anything like him.

 ��I need to break into a Gringotts vault.��

 Harry had not meant to say it so badly, the words were forced from him as pain shot through his 
lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to 
deal with Griphook first.

��350ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad.

 ��Harry �C�� said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. 

��Break into a Gringotts vault?�� repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted his position 
upon the bed. ��It is impossible.��

 ��No, it isn��t,�� Ron contradicted him. ��It��s been done.��

 ��Yeah,�� said Harry. ��The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.�� 

��The vault in question was empty at the time,�� snapped the goblin, and Harry understood that 
even though Griphook had left Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defenses being 
breached. ��Its protection was minimal.�� 

��Well, the vault we need to get into isn��t empty, and I��m guessing its protection will be pretty 
powerful,�� said Harry. ��It belongs to the Lestranges.�� 

He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to 
explain after Griphook had given his answer. 

��You have no chance,�� said Griphook flatly. ��No chance at all. If you seek beneath our floors, 
a treasure that was never yours �C�� 

��Thief, you have been warned, beware �C yeah, I know, I remember,�� said Harry. ��But I��m not 
trying to get myself any treasure, I��m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you 
believe that?�� 

The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry��s forehead prickled, but 
he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation. 

��If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain,�� said 
Griphook finally, ��it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection 
or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.�� 

��Wand-carriers,�� repeated Harry, The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled, as 
Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door. 

��The right to carry a wand,�� said the goblin quietly, ��has long been contested between wizards 
and goblins.��

 ��Well, goblins can do magic without wands,�� said Ron. 

 ��That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, 

they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!��

��351ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Well, goblins won��t share any of their magic either,�� said Ron. ��You won��t tell us how to 
make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have 
never �C�� 

��It doesn��t matter,�� said Harry, noting Griphook��s rising color. ��This isn��t about wizards versus 

goblins or any other sort of magical creature �C��

 Griphook gave a nasty laugh. 

��But it is, it is precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, your race is set 
still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, 
and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?�� 

��We do!�� said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. ��We protest! And I��m hunted 
quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I��m a Mudblood!��

 ��Don��t call yourself �C�� Ron muttered. 

��Why shouldn��t I?�� said Hermione. ��Mudblood, and proud of it! I��ve got no higher position 
under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the 
Malfoys!�� 

As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had 
made, scarlet against her throat. 

��Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?�� she asked. ��Did you know that we��ve 
wanted elves to be freed for years?�� (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione��s chair.) 
��You can��t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!��

 The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiousity he had shown Harry.

 ��What do you seek within the Lestranges�� vault?�� he asked abruptly. ��The sword that lies inside 
it is a fake. This is the real one.�� He looked from one to the other of them. ��I think that you already 
know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.�� 

��But the fake sword isn��t the only thing in that vault, is it?�� asked Harry. ��Perhaps you��ve seen 
other things in there?�� 

His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his 
scar. 

 The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. 

��It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous

��352ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our 
fingers.�� 

The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione to Ron and 
then back again.

 ��So young,�� he said finally, ��to be fighting so many.�� 

��Will you help us?�� said Harry. ��We haven��t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin��s help. 

You��re our one chance.��

 ��I shall ... think about it,�� said Griphook maddeningly.

 ��But �C�� Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. 

 ��Thank you,�� said Harry.

 The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his short legs. 

��I think,�� he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur��s bed, ��that the Skele-Gro 

has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me.�� 

��Yeah, of course,�� said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the 
sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw 
resentment in the goblin��s eyes as he closed the door upon him.

 ��Little git,�� whispered Ron. ��He��s enjoying keeping us hanging.�� 

��Harry,�� whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the 
still-dark landing, ��are you saying what I think you��re saying? Are you saying there��s a Horcrux in 
the Lestranges vault?�� 

��Yes,�� said Harry. ��Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we��d been in there, she was beside 
herself. Why? What did she think we��d seen, what else did she think we might have taken? 
Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.�� 

��But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who��s been, places he��s done something 
important?�� said Ron, looking baffled. ��Was he ever inside the Lestranges�� vault?�� 

��I don��t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,�� said Harry. ��He never had gold there 
when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the 
outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.�� 

Harry��s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to understand about 
Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander.

��I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think he��d have 
seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don��t forget, he trusted Bellatrix 
and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for 
him after he vanished. He said it the night he came back, I heard him.��

 Harry rubbed his scar. 

��I don��t think he��d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy 
the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place 
it in her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me... except 
for Hogwarts.��

 When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head. 

 ��You really understand him.�� 

��Bits of him,�� said Harry. ��Bits ... I just wish I��d understood Dumbledore as much. But we��ll 
see. Come on �C Ollivander now.�� 

Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but very impressed as they followed him across the little 
landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur��s. A weak ��Come in!�� answered them. 

The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been held in the 
cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, 
the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed 
vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a 
skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not 
visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and the freshly dug grave. 

 ��Mr. Ollivander, I��m sorry to disturb you,�� Harry said. 

��My dear boy,�� Ollivander��s voice was feeble. ��You rescued us, I thought we would die in that 
place, I can never thank you ... never thank you ... enough.��

 ��We were glad to do it.�� 

Harry��s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to 
beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic ... yet he had 
made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. Feigning a calm he did not feel, he 
groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand. 

 ��Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.��

��354ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Anything. Anything.�� Said the wandmaker weakly.

 ��Can you mend this? Is it possible?�� 

Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected halves in his 
palm. 

��Holly and phoenix feather,�� said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. ��Eleven inches. Nice and 

supple.��

 ��Yes,�� said Harry. ��Can you -?�� 

��No,�� whispered Ollivander. ��I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered this degree of 

damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.�� 

Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took the wand halves back 
and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered 
wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he 
had brought from the Malfoys��.

 ��Can you identify these?�� Harry asked. 

 The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between 
his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly. 

��Walnut and dragon heartstring,�� he said. ��Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This 
wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.��

 ��And this one?��

 Ollivander performed the same examination. 

��Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of 

Draco Malfoy.��

 ��Was?�� repeated Harry. ��Isn��t it still his?��

 ��Perhaps not. If you took it �C��

 ��- I did �C�� 

��-then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also depends upon the 
wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.��

 There was a silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea. 

��You talk about wands like they��ve got feelings,�� said Harry, ��like they can think for 
themselves.��

��355ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��The wand chooses the wizard,�� said Ollivander. ��That much has always been clear to those of 

us who have studied wandlore.��

 ��A person can still use a wand that hasn��t chosen them, though?�� asked Harry. 

��Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any 
instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity 
between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual 
quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.�� 

The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound. ��I took this wand from Draco 
Malfoy by force,�� said Harry. ��Can I use it safely?�� 

��I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its 
will to its new master.�� 

��So I should use this one?�� said Ron, pulling Wormtail��s wand out of his pocket and handing it 
to Ollivander. 

��Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this 
shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your 
bidding, and do it well, than another wand.��

 ��And this holds true for all wands, does it?�� asked Harry. 

��I think so,�� replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry��s face. ��You ask deep 
questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.�� 

��So, it isn��t necessary to kill the previous owner to take the possession of a wand?�� asked 
Harry.

 Ollivander swallowed.

 ��Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.�� 

��There are legends, though,�� said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar 
became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort has decided to put his idea into action. ��Legends 
about a wand �C or wands �C that have been passed from hand to hand by murder.�� 

Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes were 
enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. 

 ��Only one wand, I think,�� he whispered. 

 ��And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn��t he?�� asked Harry.

��356ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I �C how?�� croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help. ��How 

do you know this?��

 ��He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,�� said Harry.

 Ollivander looked terrified. 

��He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I �C I had no choice but to tell 
him what I knew, what I guessed!�� 

��I understand,�� said Harry. ��You told him about the twin cores? You said he just had to borrow 
another wizard��s wand?��

 Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He nodded slowly. 

��But it didn��t work,�� Harry went on. ��Mine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you know why 

that is?��

 Ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded. 

��I had ... never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique that night. The 
connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand would have snapped the 
borrowed wand, I do not know...�� 

��We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. When YouKnow-
Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and asked about that 
other wand, didn��t he?�� 

��How do you know this?��

 Harry did not answer. 

��Yes, he asked,�� whispered Ollivander. ��He wanted to know everything I could tell him about 
the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.��

 Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted. 

��The Dark Lord,�� said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, ��had always been happy with 
the wand I made him �C yew and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches �C until he discovered 
the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more powerful wand, as the only way to 
conquer yours.�� 

��But he��ll know soon, if he doesn��t already, that mine��s broken beyond repair,�� said Harry 
quietly.

 ��No!�� said Hermione, sounding frightened. ��He can��t know that, Harry, how could he -?��

��357ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Priori Incantatem,�� said Harry. ��We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys��, 
Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells they��ve cast lately, 
they��d see that yours broke mine, they��ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they��ll realize 
that I��ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.�� 

The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron gave Harry a 

reproachful look, and said, ��Let��s not worry about that now -�� 

But Mr. Ollivander intervened. 

��The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is 

determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.��

 ��And will it?�� 

��The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,�� said Ollivander, ��but the idea of the 

Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit ... formidable.�� 

Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when they first met, of how much he 
liked Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the 
Dark Wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him.

 ��You �C you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?�� asked Hermione. 

��Oh yes,�� said Ollivander. ��Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand��s course through 
history. There are gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or 
hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned 
in wandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other 
wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity.��

 ��So you �C you don��t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?�� Hermione asked hopefully. 

��No,�� said Ollivander. ��Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its history is 
bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such 
passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of 
incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.�� 

��Mr. Ollivander,�� said Harry, ��you told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder 
Wand, didn��t you?�� 

Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. ��But how �C how do 
you - ?��

��358ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Never mind how I know it,�� said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and 
he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so 
much farther north. ��You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand?�� 

��It was a rumor,�� whispered Ollivander. ��A rumor, years and years ago long before you were 
born, I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it would be for business; 
that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!�� 

��Yes, I can see that,�� said Harry. He stood up. ��Mr. Ollivander, one last thing, and then we��ll 

let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?��

 ��The �C the what?�� asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered.

 ��The Deathly Hallows.��

 ��I��m afraid I don��t know what you��re talking about. Is this still something to do with wands?�� 

Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He did not know 

about the Hallows. 

 ��Thank you,�� said Harry. ��Thank you very much. We��ll leave you to get some rest now.�� 

Ollivander looked stricken. ��He was torturing me!�� he gasped. ��The Cruciatus Curse ... you 

have no idea ...��

 ��I do,�� said Harry, ��I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this.�� 

He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught glimpses of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and 
Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry as 
he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, Ron and 
Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry 
walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully. It was a huge effort now 
to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have 
to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory 
was right. He must make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and 
Hermione. 

��Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,�� he said, ��I saw You-Know-Who trying to 
find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn��t have it anymore. It was 
stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don��t 
know �C but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can��t have been that

��359ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

difficult.�� 

Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts. Harry could see him standing there, and see too the 
lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer. 

��And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of his power, 
when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat 
him, and he took the Elder Wand.��

 ��Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?�� said Ron. ��But then �C where is it now?�� 

��At Hogwarts,�� said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden.

 ��But then, let��s go!�� said Ron urgently. ��Harry, let��s go and get it before he does!�� 

��It��s too late for that,�� said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched his head, trying to 
help it resist. ��He knows where it is. He��s there now.�� 

��Harry!�� Ron said furiously. ��How long have you known this �C why have we been wasting 
time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone �C we could still go �C�� 

��No,�� said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. ��Hermione��s right. Dumbledore didn��t 
want me to have it. He didn��t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.��

 ��The unbeatable wand, Harry!�� moaned Ron. 

 ��I��m not supposed to ... I��m supposed to get the Horcruxes... �� 

And now everything was cool and dark. The sun was barely visible over the horizon as he 

glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake.

 ��I shall join you in the castle shortly,�� he said in his high, cold voice. ��Leave me now.�� 

Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry walked 
slowly, waiting for Snape��s figure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, 
to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal 
himself ... and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even 
from his own eyes. 

And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the beloved castle, his 
first kingdom, his birthright ... 

And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white marble tomb, an 
unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that 
heady sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand. How fitting that this would be

��360ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

its last great act. 

The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long as thin as it had been in 
life. He raised the wand again. 

The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent (��͸����), pale, sunken, yet almost 
perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose, He felt amused derision. 
Dumbledore��s hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, buried 
with him. 

Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? Had he thought that 
the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the 
wand from Dumbledore��s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of sparks flew from its tip, sparkling 
over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last.

Chapter Twenty-Five 
Shell Cottage 


Bill and Fleur's cottage stood alone on a cliff 


overlooking 
the sea, its walls embedded with shells and 

whitewashed. 
It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry 

went inside the 
tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant 

ebb and flow 
of the sea, like the breathing of some great, 

slumbering 
creature. He spent much of the next few days 

making 
excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, 
and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. 

The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He could not 
remember, ever before, choosing not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help 
voicing whenever they were together. 

"What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?" 

"What if working out what the symbol meant made you 'worthy' to get the Hallows?" 

"Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-
Who?" 

Harry had no answers. There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright 
madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain 
satisfactorily why he had decided against it. Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal 
arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to him. 

The odd thing was that Hermione's support made him feel just as confused as Ron's doubts. 

Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, 
and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered. 

"You could never have done that, Harry," she said again and again. "You couldn't have broken 
into Dumbledore's grave." 

But the idea of Dumbledore's corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he 
might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore's intentions. He felt that he was still groping in 
the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the

��362ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore 
crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the 
cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died. 

"But is he dead?" said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had been 
staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione 
had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument. 

"Yes, he is. Ron, please don't start that again!" 

"Look at the facts, Hermione," said Ron, speaking across Harry, who continued to gaze at the 
horizon. "The silver doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror -" 

"Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don't you, Harry?" 

"I could have," said Harry without looking at her. 

"But you don't think you did, do you?" asked Ron. 

"No, I don't," said Harry. 

"There you go!" said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. "If it wasn't Dumbledore, 
explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?" 

"I can't -but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he's lying in a tomb at 
Hogwarts?" 

"I dunno, it could've been his ghost!" 

"Dumbledore wouldn't come back as a ghost," said Harry. There was little about Dumbledore he 
was sure of now, but he knew that much. "He would have gone on." 

"What d'you mean, 'gone on'?" asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice behind 
them said, "'Arry?" 

Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze. 

"'Arry, Grip'ook would like to speak to you. 'E eez in ze smallest bedroom, 'e says 'e does not 
want to be over'eard." 

Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable as she 
walked back around the house. 

Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage's three bedrooms, 
in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the 
bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage.

��363ҳ��

"I have reached my decision, Harry Potter," said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a 
low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. "Though the goblins of Gringotts will 
consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you -" 

"That's great!" said Harry, relief surging through him. "Griphook, thank you, we're really -" 

"- in return," said the goblin firmly, "for payment." 

Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. "How much do you want? I've got gold." 

"Not gold," said Griphook. "I have gold." 

His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. 

"I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor." 

Harry's spirits plummeted. "You can't have that," he said. "I'm sorry." 

"Then," said the goblin softly, "we have a problem." 

"We can give you something else," said Ron eagerly. "I'll bet the Lestranges have got loads of 
stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault." 

He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily. 

"I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!" 

"The sword's ours -" 

"It is not," said the goblin. 

"We're Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor's -" 

"And before it was Gryffindor's, whose was it?" demanded the goblin, sitting up straight. 

"No one's," said Ron. "It was made for him, wasn't it?" 

"No!" cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. "Wizarding 
arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First's, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a 
lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the goblins. The sword is the price of 
my hire, take it or leave it!" 

Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then said, "We need to discuss this, 

Griphook, if that's all right. Could you give us a few minutes?" 

The goblin nodded, looking sour. 

Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to 
think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, "He's having a laugh. We can't let him have that sword." 

"It is true?" Harry asked Hermione. "Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?"

��364ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I don't know," she said hopelessly. "Wizarding history often skates over (go over quickly) what 
the wizards have done to other magical races, but there's no account that I know of that says 
Gryffindor stole the sword." 

"It'll be one of those goblin stories," said Ron, "about how the wizards are always trying to get 
one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn't asked for one of our 
wands." 

"Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron." said Hermione. "They've been treated 
brutally in the past." 

"Goblins aren't exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?" said Ron. "They've killed plenty 
of us. They've fought dirty too." 

"But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded���ӵ� and violent isn't 
going to make him more likely to help us, is it?" 

There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked out of 
the window at Dobby's grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone. 

"Okay," said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, "how's this? We tell Griphook we need 
the sword until we get inside the vault and then he can have it. There's a fake in these, isn't there? 
We switch them, and give him the fake." 

"Ron, he'd know the difference better than we would!" said Hermione. "He's the only one who 
realized there had been a swap!" 

"Yeah, but we could scarper (British Slang)��� 
escape without paying a debt) before he 
realizes -" 

He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him. 

"That," she said quietly, "is despicable. Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you 
wonder why goblins don't like wizards, Ron?" 

Ron's ears had turned red. "All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What's your 
solution, then?" 

"We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable." 

"Brilliant, I'll go and get one of our ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap�ð�װ
ֽ��װ it." 

Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the

��365ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one 
indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. 

He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that 
Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him. He had always been proud to be a 
Gryffindor. Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who had clashed with 
the pureblood-loving Slytherin. 

"Maybe he's lying," Harry said, opening his eyes again. "Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor didn't 

take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history's right?" 

"Does it make a difference?" asked Hermione. 

"Changes how I feel about it," said Harry. 

He took a deep breath. 

"We'll tell him he can have the sword after he's helped us get into that vault - but we'll be careful 

to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it." 

A grin spread slowly across Ron's face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed. 

"Harry, we can't -" 

"He can have it," Harry went on, "after we've used it on all of the Horcruxes. I'll make sure he 

gets it then. I'll keep my word." 

"But that could be years!" said Hermione. 

"I know that, but he needn't. I won't be lying... really." 

Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remembered the words that had 

been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard, FOR THE GREATER GOOD. He pushed the 

idea away. What choice did they have? 

"I don't like it," said Hermione. 

"Nor do I, much," Harry admitted. 

"Well, I think it's genius," said Ron, standing up again. "Let's go and tell him." 

Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any 
definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; 
he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for 
nobody but Harry. 

"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?"

"Yes," said Harry. 

"Then shake," said the goblin, holding out his hand. 

Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. 
Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, "So. We begin!" 

It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They settled to work in the 
smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook's preference, in semidarkness. 

"I have visited the Lestranges' vault only once," Griphook told them, "on the occasion I was told 
to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding 
families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected." 

They remained shut in the cupboard-like room for hours at a time. Slowly the days stretched 
into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store 
of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted. 

"There's really only enough left for one of us," said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike potion 
against the lamplight. 

"That'll be enough," said Harry, who was examining Griphook's hand-drawn map of the deepest 
passageways. 

The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on 
now that Harry, Ron and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, 
although Harry often felt Bill's eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned. 

The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. 
Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed 
to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges' vault. 
Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it. They 
needed Griphook. 

The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he 
continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following 
an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. 
Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same 
food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi. 

Harry felt responsible. It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell

��367ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven 
into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work. 

"I'm sorry," he told Fleur, one blustery (stormy) April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. 
"I never meant you to have to deal with all of this." 

She had just set some knives to work, chipping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had 
preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced 
behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened. 

"'Arry, you saved my sister's life, I do not forget." 

This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had 
never been in real danger. 

"Anyway," Fleur went on, pointing her want at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to 
bubble at once, "Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel's zis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze 
goblin," she scowled a little at the mention of him, "can move downstairs, and you, Ron, and Dean 
can take zat room." 

"We don't mind sleeping in the living room," said Harry, who knew that Griphook would think 
poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. "Don't 
worry about us." And when she tried to protest he went on, "We'll be off your hands soon too, Ron, 
Hermione, and I. We won't need to be here much longer." 

"But, what do you mean?" she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole dish 
now suspended in midair. "Of course you must not leave, you are safe 'ere!" 

She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door opened at 
that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of 
driftwood. 

"... and tiny little ears," Luna was saying, "a bit like hippo's, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. 
And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast." 

Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the 
combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. Seizing 
the chance to escape Fleur's questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed 
them. 

"... and if you ever come to our house I'll be able to show you the horn. Daddy wrote to me

��368ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

about it but I haven't seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and 
I never got home for Christmas," Luna was saying, as she and Dean relit the fire. 

"Luna, we told you," Hermione called over to her. "That horn exploded. It came from an 
Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack -" 

"No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn," said Luna serenely, "Daddy told me. It will probably 
have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know." 

Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. 
Ollivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill's 
arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase. 

"I'm going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander," said Luna, approaching the old man. 

"And I you, my dear," said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. "You were an inexpressible 
comfort to me in that terrible place." 

"So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander," said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. "And I wonder whezzer 
you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill's Auntie Murie!? I never returned 'er tiara." 

"It will be an honor," said Ollivander with a little bow, "the very least I can do in return for your 
generous hospitality." 

Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara sat 
glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. 

"Moonstones and diamonds," said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry 
noticing. "Made by goblins, I think?" 

"And paid for by wizards," said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive 
and challenging. 

A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander set off into the night. 
The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to 
move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them. Fleur, Harry 
noticed, was merely playing with her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; 
however, Bill returned before they had finished their first course, his long hair tangled by the wind. 

"Everything's fine," he told Fleur. "Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends 
you all her love, Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they're still operating an Owl-
Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she

542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

thought we'd stolen it." 

"Ah, she eez charmant, your aunt," said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty 
plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them and marched out of the room. 

"Daddy's made a tiara," piped up Luna, "Well, more of a crown, really." 

Ron caught Harry's eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous 
headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius. 

"Yes, he's trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he's identified most of the 
main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference -" 

There was a bang on the front door. Everyone's head turned toward it. Fleur came running out of 
the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feed, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight. 

"Who is it?" Bill called. 

"It is I, Remus John Lupin!" called a voice over the howling wind. 

Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? 

"I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, 
told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!" 

"Lupin," muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. 

Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling cloak, his graying hair 

windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried 

aloud, "It's a boy! We've named him Ted, after Dora's father!" 

Hermione shrieked. 

"Wha -? Tonks - Tonks has had the baby?" 

"Yes, yes, she's had the baby!" shouted Lupin. 

All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief, Hermione and Fleur both squealed, 

"Congratulations!" and Ron said, "Blimey, a baby!" as if he had never heard of such a thing before. 

"Yes -yes -a boy," said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He strode 
around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never 
have happened. 

"You'll be godfather?" he said as he released Harry. 

"M-me?" stammered Harry.

��370ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"You, yes, of course - Dora quite agrees, no one better -" 

"I - yeah - blimey -" 

Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur 
was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink. 

"I can't stay long, I must get back," said Lupin, beaming around at them all. He looked years 

younger than Harry had ever seen him. "Thank you, thank you, Bill" 

Bill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high in a toast. 

"To Teddy Remus Lupin," said Lupin, "a great wizard in the making (future)!" 

"'Oo does 'e look like?" Fleur inquired. 

"I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black when he 
was born, but I swear it's turned ginger in the hour since. Probably blond by the time I get back. 
Andromeda says Tonks's hair started changing color the day that she was born." He drained his 
goblet. "Oh, go on then, just one more," he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again. 

The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon opening 
another bottle of wine. Lupin's news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them 
for a while from their state of siege. Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed 
untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he 
now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill's 
eyes following the goblin up the stairs. 

"No... no... I really must get back," said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He 
got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself. 

"Good-bye, good-bye -I'll try and bring some pictures in a few day's time -they'll all be so glad 
to know that I've seen you -" 

He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the 
men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night. 

"Godfather, Harry!" said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the table. 
"A real honor! Congratulations!" 

As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the door behind him closed, 
shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin's 
absence.

��371ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn't been easy to get an opportunity with the 

cottage this full of people." 

Bill hesitated. "Harry, you're planning something with Griphook." 

It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, 

waiting. 

"I know goblins," said Bill. "I've worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there 
can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends -or, at least, goblins I know 
well, and like." 

Again, Bill hesitated. "Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised 

him in return?" 

"I can't tell you that," said Harry. "Sorry, Bill." 

The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets. 

"Wait," Bill told her, "Just a moment." 

She backed out and he closed the door again. 

"Then I have to say this," Bill went on. "If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, 
and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin 
notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones." 

Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. "What 
do you mean?" he asked. 

"We are talking about a different breed of being," said Bill. "Dealings between wizards and 
goblins have been fraught for centuries -but you'll know all that from History of Magic. There has 
been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a 
belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards 
cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership." 

"I respect -" Harry began, but Bill shook his head. 

"You don't understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To 
a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin made 
objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs." 

"But it was bought -" 

"-then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, however,

��372ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw 
Griphook's face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the 
fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser 
died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard 
without further payment, little more than theft." 

Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was letting 
on. 

"All I am saying," said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, "is to be 
very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts 
than to renege [r.'n..g]ΥԼ;���� 
on a promise to a goblin." 

"Right," said Harry as Bill opened the door, "yeah. Thanks. I'll bear that in mind." 

As he followed Bill back to the others a wry (ironic) thought came to him, born no doubt of the 
wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin 
as Sirius Black had been to him.

Chapter Twenty-Six 



Gringotts 

Their plans were made, their preparations complete; in 


the smallest 
bedroom a single long, coarse black hair (plucked from 

the sweater 
Hermione had been wearing at Malfoy Manor) lay curled 

in a small 
glass phial on the mantelpiece. 
"And you'll be using her actual wand," said Harry, nodding toward the walnut wand, "so I 

reckon you'll be pretty convincing."

 Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bit her as she picked it up. 

"I hate that thing," she said in a low voice. "I really hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn't work 

properly for me ... It's like a bit of her." 

Harry could not help but remember how Hermione has dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn 
wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling him 
to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however, the eve of their 
attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her.

 "It'll probably help you get in character, though," said Ron. "think what that wand's done!" 

"But that's my point!" said Hermione. "This is the wand that tortured Neville's mum and dad, 
and who knows how many other people? This is the wand that killed Sirius!" 

Harry had not thought of that. He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to 
snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor's sword, which was propped against the wall beside him. 

"I miss my wand," Hermione said miserably. "I wish Mr. Ollivander could have made me 
another one too." 

Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She was out on the back lawn at that 
moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the 
Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily. 

Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been 
surprised, but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione's had done. 
Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands, Harry thought he 
knew what Hermione's problem was. She had not won the walnut wand's allegiance by taking it

��374ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

personally from Bellatrix. 

The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached instinctively for the hilt 
of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at once. He could tell that the goblin 
had noticed. 

Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said, "We've just been checking the last-minute 
stuff, Griphook. We've told Bill and Fleur we're leaving tomorrow, and we've told them not to get 
up to see us off." 

They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to transform in Bellatrix 
before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to 
do, the better. They had also explained that they would not be returning. As they had lost Perkin's 
old tent on the night that the Snatcher's caught them, Bill had lent them another one. It was now 
packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from 
the Snatchers by the simple expedient (Ӧ���취��Ȩ���ֶ�) of stuffing it down her sock. 

Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the home comforts they had 
enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of Shell 
Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard, tired of being shut in the 
tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and 
when they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor's sword remained a 
question to which Harry had no answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going to 
do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than five 
minutes at a time. 

"He could give my mother lessons," growled Ron, as the goblin's long fingers kept appearing 
around the edges of doors. 

With Bill's warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch 
for possible skullduggery. 

Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up 
attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it, Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been 
able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than "We'll just 
have to wing it����ʱ׼��/�ճɣ�, mate." 

Harry slept badly that night. Lying away in the early hours, he thought back to the way he had

��375ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, 
almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts. He could not 
shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was 
good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the 
difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir 
and was sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry 
did not speak. 

It was a relief when six o��clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags, dress in 
the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and 
Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May. Harry looked up at 
the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and 
forward against the cliff. He was going to miss the sound. 

Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby's grave now, in a 
year's time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf's name had 
already acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest 
in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking 
down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. 
His fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, through which 
he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledore's eye. 
Then the sound of a door opening made him look around. 

Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As 
she walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old 
robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really 
Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long black 
hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then 
she spoke, and he heard Hermione through Bellatrix's low voice.

 "She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so I can do you ...��

 "Right, but remember, I don't like the beard too long." 

 "Oh, for heaven's sake, this isn't about looking handsome." 

"It's not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you did

��376ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

last time." 

Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed various 
aspects of Ron's appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting 
to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be 
concealed under the Invisibility Cloak.

 "There," said Hermione, "how does he look, Harry?" 

It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought, because he knew 
him so well. Ron's hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no 
freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.

 "Well, he's not my type��������ϲ�������ͣ�, but he'll do," said Harry. "Shall we go, then?" 

All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, 
then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius 
Chard stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook 
spoke. 

 "I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?" 

Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked on front of Harry's 
throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength 
with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it 
over them both.

 "Perfect," she said, bending down to check Harry's feet. "I can't see a thing. Let's go." 

Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating with all his might on 
the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter 
as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later Harry's feet found pavement and 
he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions 
of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn's existence. 

The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Tom, the stooped and toothless landlord, 
was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation 
in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the shadows. 

"Madam Lestrange," murmured Tom, and as Hermione paused he inclined his head 
subserviently.

��377ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Good morning," said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback��
��/����under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised. 

"Too polite," Harry whispered in Hermione's ear as they passed out of the Inn into the tiny 
backyard. "You need to treat people like they're scum!"

 "Okay, okay!" 

Hermione drew out Bellatrix's wand and rapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them. 
At once the bricks began to whirl and spin, A hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew 
wider and wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon 
Alley. 

It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any shoppers abroad 
(outside, out of doors). The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place 
Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever 
were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created 
since his last visit. Harry's own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many 
windows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE. 

A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them moaning to the few 
passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that they were really wizards. One man had a bloody 
bandage over his eye. 

As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. They seemed to melt away 
before her, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after 
them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path. 

"My children," he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-pitched, he sounded 

distraught. "Where are my children? What has he done with them? You know, you know!" 

 "I -I really -" stammered Hermione. 

The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat. Then, with a bang and a burst of red light he 
was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched 
and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the 
street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passersby gathered their robes about them and 
broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene. 

Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a moment

��378ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. 

Before they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry from behind them.

 "Why, Madam Lestrange!" 

Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry's neck. A tall, thin wizard 

with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them. 

"It's Travers," hissed the goblin into Harry's ear, but at that moment Harry could not think who 
Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to full height and said with as much contempt as she 
could muster,

 "And what do you want?" 

 Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted. 

"He's another Death Eater!" breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to repeat the 
information into Hermione's ear. 

 "I merely sought to greet you," said Travers coolly, "but if my presence is not welcome ...�� 

Harry recognized his voice now. Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned 
to Xenophilius��s house. 

"No, no, not at all, Travers," said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up her mistake. "How are 
you?"

 "Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix."

 "Really? Why?" asked Hermione. 

"Well," Travers coughed, "I heard that the Inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the 
house, after the ... ah ... escape." 

Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be 
out in public - 

"The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past," said Hermione 
in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix's most contemptuous manner. "Perhaps your credit is not as 
good with him as mine is, Travers." 

Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious. He glanced down at 

the man Ron had just Stunned. 

 "How did it offend you?"

 "It does not matter, it will not do so again," said Hermione coolly.

"Some of these wandless can be troublesome," said Travers. "While they do nothing but beg I 
have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case in the Ministry last week. 
'I'm a witch, sir, I'm a witch, let me prove it to you!" he said in a squeaky impersonation. "As if I 
was going to give her my wand -but whose wand," said Travers curiously, "are you using at the 
moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was -" 

"I have my wand here," said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix's wand. "I don't know what 

rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed."

 Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron. 

 "Who is your friend? I do not recognize him." 

"This is Dragomir Despard," said Hermione; they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the 

safest cover for Ron to assume. "He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark 

Lord's aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime."

 "Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?"

 "'Ow you?" said Ron, holding out his hand. 

 Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron's hand as though frightened of dirtying himself. 

��So what brings you and your-ah-sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?" asked 

Travers.

 "I need to visit Gringotts," said Hermione. 

"Alas, I also," said Travers. "Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live without it, yet I confess I 

deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends." 

 Harry felt Griphook's clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck. 

 "Shall we?" said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward. 

Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked, cobbled 
street toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops. 
Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed. 

A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with 
Travers matching at what he believed to be Bellatrix's side, there was no means for Harry to 
communicate with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps 
leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried���Ʒ��� 
goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were

��380ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

clutching long thin golden rods. 

 "Ah, Probity Probes," signed Travers theatrically, "so crude but so effective!" 

And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods 
and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment 
and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds, Harry pointed Draco's wand at 
each of the guards in turn and murmured, "Confundo" twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was 
looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells 
hit them.

 Hermione's long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps. 

 "One moment, madam," said the guard, raising his Probe. 

"But you've just done that!" said Hermione in Bellatrix's commanding, arrogant voice. Travers 
looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe 

and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice,

 "Yeah, you've just checked them, Marius." 

Hermione swept forward. Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them. 

Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold. The wizards were both scratching their heads. 

Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which carried the 
poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a 
knife-sharp memory came to him, standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven, 
the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, "Like I said, yeh'd 
be mad ter try an' rob it." Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted 
repository���� 
;���ش�of a trove (sum of money) of gold he had never known he possessed, and 
never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal ... But within seconds they 
were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank. 

The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the first customers of 
the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold 
coin through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of 
explaining features of the hall to Ron. 

The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, "Leprechaun," 
and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back

��381ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to him.

 Hermione stepped forward. 

"Madam Lestrange!" said the goblin, evidently startled. "Dear me! How -how may I help you 

today?"

 "I wish to enter my vault," said Hermione. 

The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was Travers hanging 

back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione.

 "You have ... identification?" asked the goblin.

 "Identification? I -I have never been asked for identification before!" said Hermione. 

"They know!" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, "They must have been warned there might be 

an imposter!" 

"Your wand will do, madam," said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling hand, and in a 
dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix's 
wand had been stolen.

 "Act now, act now," whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, "the Imperious Curse!" 

Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, 
for the first time in his life, "Imperio!" 

A curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling, warmth that seemed to flow 
from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just 
cast. The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and then said, "Ah, you have had a 
new wand made, Madam Lestrange!"

 "What?" said Hermione, "No, no, that's mine -" 

"A new wand?" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all around were 
watching. "But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?" 

 Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, "Imperio!" once more. 

"Oh yes, I see," said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, "yes, very handsome, and is it 
working well? I always think wands require a little breaking inѵ������ 
, don't you?" 

Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief she accepted the bizarre 
turn of events without comment.

 The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached.

��382ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I shall need the Clankers," he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later 
with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. "Good, 
good! So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange," said the old goblin, hopping down off his 
stool and vanishing from sight. "I shall take you to your vault." 

He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the contents of the 
leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open. 
Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion. 

 ��Wait �C Bogrod!��

 Another goblin came scurrying around the counter. 

��We have instructions,�� he said with a bow to Hermione. ��Forgive me, Madam, but there have 
been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.��

 He whispered urgently in Bogrod��s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off. 

��I am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault ... Very old 
family ... old clients ... This way, please ...�� 

And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. Harry looked 
back at Travers , who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his 
decision. With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, walking meekly in their wake 
as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with 
flaming torches. 

��We��re in trouble; they suspect,�� said Harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off 
the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders, neither Travers nor Bogrod 
showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst. ��They��re 
Imperiused,�� he added, in response to Hermione and Ron��s confused queries about Travers and 
Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. ��I don��t think I did it strongly enough, I 
don��t know ...�� 

And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him 

when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse, ��You need to mean them, Potter!��

 ��What do we do?�� asked Ron. ��Shall we get out now, while we can?�� 

��If we can,�� said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, beyond which 

who knew what was happening.

��383ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We��ve got this far, I say we go on,�� said Harry. 

��Good!�� said Griphook. ��So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no longer have the authority. 
But there will not be room for the wizard.��

 Harry pointed his wand at Travers. 

��Imperio!��

 The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace.

 ��What are you making him do?�� 

��Hide,�� said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that 
came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was sure he could hear 
shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front of Griphook, 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back. 

With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed, They hurried past Travers, who was wriggling 
into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, 
sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the 
tracks. His hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the 
earth, but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; 
the more he thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, 
to have brought along Bellatrix��s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it �C 

They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at 
speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry 
heard Griphook shout, ��No!�� but there was no braking. They zoomed through it. Water filled 
Harry��s eyes and mouth. He could not see or breathe. Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped 
over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage 
wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though 
weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor. 

��C-Cushioning Charm,�� Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to Harry��s 
horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping 
wet and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again. They were realizing it as they 
looked at each other, feeling their own faces. 

��The Thief��s Downfall!�� said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back the deluge

��384ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water. ��It washes away all 
enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are imposers in Gringotts, they have set 
off defenses against us!�� 

Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust his own 
hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see 
Bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment, The Thief��s Downfall seemed to have lifted his 
Imperius Curse. 

��We need him,�� said Griphook, ��we cannot enter the vault without a Gringott��s goblin. And we 
need the clankers!�� 

��Imperio!�� Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the 
sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his 
befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron hurried to pick up the leather 
bag of metal tools. 

��Harry, I think I can hear people coming!�� said Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix��s wand at 
the waterfall and cried, ��Protego!�� They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water 
as it flew up the passageway.

 ��Good thinking,�� said Harry. ��Lead the way, Griphook!�� 

��How are we going to get out again?�� Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after 
the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog. 

��Let��s worry about that when we have to,�� said Harry. He was trying to listen. He thought he 
could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. ��Griphook, how much farther?��

 ��Not far, Harry Potter, not far ...�� 

And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared, but which still 

brought all of them to a halt. 

A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to four or five of 
the deepest vaults in the place. The beast��s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long 
incarceration��� 
under the ground, its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore heavy cuffs��
�� 
from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked 
wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned 
its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth and

��385ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway. 

��It is partially blind,�� panted Griphook, ��but even more savage for that. However, we have the 
means to control it. It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.�� 

Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments 
that when shaken made a long ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils���� 
. Griphook 
handed them out, Bogrod accepted his meekly. 

��You know what to do,�� Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. ��It will expect pain when it 
hears the noise. It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.�� 

They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise echoed off the 
rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry��s skull seemed to vibrate with the din. 
The dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they 
drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guess that it had been 
taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers. 

��Make him press his hand to the door!�� Griphook urged Harry, who turned his wand again 
upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault 
melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and 
goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures �C some with long spines, other with drooping 
wings �C potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown. 

��Search, fast!�� said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. He had described Hufflepuff��s cap 
to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did 
not know what it looked like. He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a 
muffled clunk from behind them. The door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they 
were plunged into total darkness. 

��No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!�� said Griphook as Ron gave a shout of surprise. 

��Light your wands, can��t you? And hurry, we have little time!��

 ��Lumos!�� 

Harry shone his lit wand around the vault, its beam fell upon glittering jewels; he saw the fake 
sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit 
their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them.

 ��Harry, could this be - ? Aargh!��

��386ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet 
tumbling from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, 
with a great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original 
impossible to discern amongst them.

 ��It burned me!�� moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers.

 ��They have added Germino and Flagrante Curses!�� said Griphook. 

��Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless �C and if you 
continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding 
gold!�� 

��Okay, don��t touch anything!�� said Harry desperately, but even as he said it, Ron accidentally 
nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron 
hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.

 ��Stand still, don��t move!�� said Hermione, clutching at Ron. 

��Just look around!�� said Harry. ��Remember, the cup��s small and gold, it��s got a badger 
engraved on it, two handles �C otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw��s symbol anywhere, the 
eagle �C�� 

They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was 
impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the 
ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the 
glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry��s wandlight passed over 
shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher he raised 
the beam, until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.

 ��It��s there, it��s up there!�� 

Ron and Hermione pointed there wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a 
three-way spotlight, the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the 
possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.

 ��And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?�� asked Ron. 

��Accio Cup!�� cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what Griphook 
had told them during their planning sessions. 

 ��No use, no use!�� snarled the goblin.

��387ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Then what do we do?�� said Harry, glaring at the goblin. ��If you want the sword, Griphook, 
then you��ll have to help us more than �C wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it 
here!�� 

Hermione fumbled insider her robes, drew out a beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then 
removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a 
silver flagon��ƺ�;��Ƕ̾�ƿ 
nearby, which did not multiply.

 ��If I can just poke the sword through a handle �C but how am I going to get up there?�� 

The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was 
tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry��s face and 
back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the dragon roar on the other 
side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder. 

They were truly trapped now. There was no way out except through the door, and a horde of 
goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw 
terror in their faces. 

��Hermione,�� said Harry, as the clanking grew louder, ��I��ve got to get up there, we��ve got to get 

rid of it �C��

 She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, ��Levicorpus.�� 

Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like white-
hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of pain, Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins 
were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of 
red-hot treasure, they struggled and yelled has Harry thrust the sword through the handle of 
Hufflepuff��s cup, hooking it onto the blade. 

��Impervius!�� screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from 
the burning metal. 

Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down, Ron and Hermione were waist deep in 
treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk 
out of sight; and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view. 

 Harry seized Griphook��s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling. 

��Liberatocorpus!�� yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the 
swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry��s hand. 

��388ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Get it!�� Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered 
onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. ��Where��s the 
sword? It had the cup on it!��

 The clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening �C it was too late �C 

 ��There!�� 

It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that 
the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of 
Harry��s hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the 
hilt of the sword and swung it high out of Harry��s reach. The tiny golden cup, skewered (���棬 
impale) by the handle on the sword��s blade was flung into the air. The goblin astride him, Harry 
dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even 
while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the 
vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of 
fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, Hermione into the outer chamber. 

Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along the swell of 
replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but 
Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry��s shoulders the moment he could, he had sprinted for 
cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, ��Thieves! Thieves! 
Help! Thieves!�� He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom were holding 
daggers and who accepted him without question. 

Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was 
through. 

��Stupefy!�� he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in. Jets of red light flew into the crowd 
of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards 
running around the corner. 

The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins. The wizards fled, 
doubled-up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing his 
wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, ��Relashio!��

 The cuffs broken open with loud bangs. 

��This way!�� Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing goblins, he

��389ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sprinted toward the blind dragon.

 ��Harry �C Harry �C what are you doing?�� cried Hermione.

 ��Get up, climb up, come on �C�� 

The dragon had not realized that it was free, Harry��s foot found the crook of its hind leg and he 
pulled himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He 
stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron climbed on behind them, and a second 
later the dragon became aware that it was untethered. 

With a roar it reared�ú���վ��, Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to the 
jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles������Ϸ�õ�
С��, and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the 
ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that 
glanced (bounce) off its flanks. 

��We��ll never get out, it��s too big!�� Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its mouth and 
belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer 
force, the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry��s eyes were shut tight against the heat 
and dust. Deafened by the crash of rock and the dragon��s roars, he could only cling to its back, 
expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, ��Defidio!�� 

She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it struggled 
upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins. Harry and Ron 
copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, 
and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind 
them the passage was full of the dragon��s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic 
fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while 
ahead, the dragon��s fire kept their progress clear. 

And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon��s brute strength���� 
, 
they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. Goblins and wizards 
shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings, Turning its horned 
head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, leaving 
them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself

into the sky.

Chapter Twenty-Seven 
The Final Hiding Place 



There was no means of steering; the dragon could not 


see where 
it was going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or 

rolled in 
midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its 

broad 
back. Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, 

London 
unfurling below them like a gray-and-green map. Harry's 
overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that 

had 
seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast's neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and 
the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin, the dragon's wings beating the air 
like the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept 
swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing. 

After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to 
throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison 
as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. 
He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this particular dragon, which 
could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He glanced around constantly, imagining 
that he could feel his scar prickling. 

How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the Lestranges' vault? 
How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? How quickly would they realize what 
had been taken? And then, when they discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort 
would know, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes. 

The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air. It climbed steadily until they were flying 
through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which 
were cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled 
(covered, wrapped) out in patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the 
landscape like strips of matte (not glossy) and glossy ribbon. 

"What do you reckon it's looking for?" Ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north. 

"No idea," Harry bellow back. His hands were numb with cold but he did not dare attempt to

��392ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail 
beneath them, if the dragon headed for open sea; he was cold and numb, not to mention 
desperately hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would 
need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had three highly edible 
humans sitting on its back? 

The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still the dragon flew, cities and 
towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a giant 
dark cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon's back. 

"Is it my imagination," shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of silence, "or are we losing 
height?" 

Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset. The 
landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon, and 
he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight. 

Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in (concentrate on, focus 
on), it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes. 

"I say we jump when it gets low enough!" Harry called back to the others. "Straight into the 
water before it realizes we're here!" They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could 
see the dragon's wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water. 

"NOW!" 

He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake; 
the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a 
freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see 
enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The 
dragon did not seem to have noticed anything; it was already fifty feet away, swooping low over 
the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and 
gasping, from the depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last 
on a distant bank. 

Harry, Ron and Hermione struck out (swim with vigor) for the opposite shore. The lake did not 
seem to be deep. Soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than 
swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.

Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and 
slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells 
around them. 

When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he had seen them properly 
since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their 
clothing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto 
their many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin 
juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them. They changes and 
then gulped down the juice. 

"Well, on the upside," said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow, 
"we got the Horcrux. On the downside -" 

"-no sword," said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in 
his jeans onto the angry burn beneath. 

"No sword," repeated Ron. "That double-crossing little scab...�� 

Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down 
on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of 
juice. 

"At least we can't wear it this time, that'd look a bit weird hanging around our necks," said Ron, 
wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. 

Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was still drinking. "What'll 
happen to it, do you think?" she asked, "Will it be alright?" 

"You sound like Hagrid," said Ron, "It's a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It's us we 
need to worry about." 

"What do you mean?" 

"Well I don't know how to break this to you," said Ron, "but I think they might have noticed we 

broke into Gringotts." 

All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. Harry's ribs ached, he 
felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed 
until his throat was raw. 

"What are we going to do, though?" said Hermione finally, hiccuping herself back to

��394ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

seriousness. "He'll know, won't he? You-Know-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes!" 

"Maybe they'll be too scared to tell him!" said Ron hopefully, "Maybe they'll cover up -" 

The sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron's voice were extinguished. Pain cleaved 
Harry's head like a sword stroke. He was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards 
faced him, and on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure. 

"What did you say to me?" His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear burned inside him. 
The one thing that he had dreaded -but it could not be true, he could not see how. The goblin was 
trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his. 

"Say it again!" murmured Voldemort. "Say it again!" 

"M-my Lord," stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, "m-my Lord... we t-tried to 
st-stop them... Im-impostors, my Lord... broke - broke into the - into the Lestranges' vault...�� 

"Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing impostors? Who were 
they?�� 

"It was... it was... the P-Potter b-boy and the t-two accomplices...�� 

"And they took?" he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him, "Tell me! What did they 

take?" 

"A... a s-small golden c-cup m-my Lord...�� 

The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger's. He was crazed, frenzied, it could 
not be true, it was impossible, nobody had known. How was it possible that the boy could have 
discovered his secret? 

The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling 
goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified. Bellatrix and Lucius 
Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and 
those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the 
golden cup. 

Alone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they passed before him in vision, his 
treasures, his safeguards, his anchors (����������) to immortality - the diary was destroyed and the 
cup was stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he know, had he already 
acted, had he traced more of them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had 
always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was his now,

��395ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy - 

But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have 
known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer 
of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless, nameless men. How could Lord Voldemort not 
have known, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated? 

True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had thought that was because 
he had no body to fell, being less than ghost... No, surely, the rest were safe... The other Horcruxes 
must be intact... 

But he must know, he must be sure... He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin's corpse as he 
passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain, the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts 


A modicum���� 
of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy know that he had hidden the 
ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the 
connection, the killings had never been traced to him. The ring, surely, was safe. 

And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate its protection? The 
idea of the locket being stolen was absurd... 

As for the school, he alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the Horcrux, because he 
alone had plumbed̽��/��the deepest secrets of that place... And there was still Nagini, who must 
remain close now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his protection... 

But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding places, he must redouble 
protection around each of his Horcruxes... A job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must 
undertake alone... 

Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease flickered inside him. 
Dumbledore had known his middle name... Dumbledore might have made the connection with the 
Gaunts... Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there 
that he would go first... 

The lake, surely impossible... though was there a slight possibility that Dumbledore might have 
known some of his past misdeeds, through the orphanage. 

And Hogwarts... but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe; it would be impossible for Potter 
to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to 
alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle. ... To tell Snape why the boy

��396ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy. 
Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust? 

He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him. He would not be parted 
from the snake anymore ... and he strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark 
garden where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join 
him like a long shadow. ... 

Harry's eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present. He was lying on the bank of 
the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by their 
worried looks, and by the continued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion (trip) into 
Voldemort's mind had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he 
was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and the lake, 
deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun. 

"He knows." His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort's high screams. "He 
knows and he's going to check where the others are, and the last one," he was already on his feet, 
"is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew it." 

"What?" 

Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried. "But what did you see? How do you 
know?" 

"I saw him find out about the cup, I - I was in his head, he's -" Harry remembered the killings "he's 
seriously angry, and scared too, he can't understand how we knew, and now he's going to 
check the others are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape's 
there, because it'll be so hard not to be seen getting in. I think he'll check that one last, but he could 
still be there within hours -" 

"Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?" asked Ron, now scrambling to his feet too. 

"No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn't think about exactly where it is -" 

"Wait, wait!" cried Hermione as Ron caught up to the Horcrux and Harry pulled out the 
Invisibility Cloak again. "We can't just go, we haven't got a plan, we need to -" 

"We need to get going," said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to sleep, looking forward to 
getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now, "Can you imagine what he's going to do 
once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides

��397ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

it isn't safe enough? 

"But how are we going to get in?" 

"We'll go to Hogsmeade," said Harry, "and try to work something out once we see what the 

protection around the school's like. Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this 

time." 

"But we don't really fit -" 

"It'll be dark, no one's going to notice our feet." 

The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water. The dragon had drunk its fill 
and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now 
black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then Hermione 
walked forward and took her place between the other two, Harry pulled the Cloak down as far as it 
would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness.

Chapter Twenty-Eight 

The Missing Mirror 

Harry's feet touched the road. He saw the 


achingly 
familiar Hogsmeade High Street, dark shop fronts, 

and the mist 
line of black mountains beyond the village and the 

curve in the 
road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light 

spilling from 
the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a 

lurch of the 
heart, he remembered with piercing accuracy how 

he had landed 
here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately 

weak 
Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon landing -and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron's 
and Hermione's arms, it happened. 

The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort's when he had realized the cup had 
been stolen. It tore at every nerve in Harry's body, and he knew that their appearance had caused it. 

Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst 
open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft. 

Harry seized Ron's wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to stun. Even 
attempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his wand, and 
the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains. 

"Accio Cloak!" roared one of the Death Eaters Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to 
escape. The Summoning Charm had not worked on it. 

"Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?" yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm and 
then to his fellows. "Spread now. He's here." 

Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them, Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as 
possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in 
the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street 
from the Death Eaters' searching wands. 

"Let's just leave!" Hermione whispered. "Disapparate now!" 

"Great idea," said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, "We know you are 
here, Potter, and there's no getting away! We'll find you!"

��399ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"They were ready for us," whispered Harry. "They set up that spell to tell them we'd come. I 
reckon they��ve done something to keep us here, trap us -" 

"What about dementors?" called another Death Eater. "Let'em have free rein, they'd find him 
quick enough!" 

"The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his -" 

"- an' dementors won't kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter's life, nor his soul. He'll be easier to 
kill if he's been Kissed first!" 

There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry. To repel dementors they would have to 
produce Patronuses which would give them away immediately. 

"We're going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!" Hermione whispered. 

Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street. Light was sucked 
from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt 
Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot. 

The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid. They could not 
Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper 
into Harry's flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along 
the wall trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, 
ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with 
their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry 
was sure of it. They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling 
breaths he detested, tasting despair in the air, closing in. He raised his wand, He could not, would 
not suffer the Dementor's Kiss, whatever happened afterward. 

It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered "Expecto Patronum!" 

The silver stag burst from his wand and charged. The Dementors scattered and there was a 
triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight "It's him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, 
it was a stag!" 

The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the Death 
Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a 
grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-side of the narrow street, and a rough voice 
said, "Potter, in here, quick!"

��400ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway. 

"Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!" muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into 
the street and slammed the door behind him. 

Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single 
candle, the grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog's Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a 
second doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. 
The stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung 
a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant 
sweetness. 

Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, they hurried 
toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the 
Hog's Head's barman, was the only person not wearing a hood. 

"So what?" he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. "So what? You send dementors 
down my street, I'll send a Patronus back at 'em! I'm not having 'em near me, I've told you that. I'm 
not having it!" 

"That wasn't your Patronus," said a Death Eater. "That was a stag. It was Potter's!" 

"Stag!" roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. "Stag! You idiot - Expecto Patronum!" 

Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged toward the High 
Street, and out of sight. 

"That's not what I saw," said the Death Eater, though was less certainly. 

"Curfew's been broken, you heard the noise," one of his companions told the barman. "Someone 

was out on the streets against regulations -" 

"If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!" 

"You set off the Caterwauling Charm?" 

"What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front 
door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven't pressed your little Dark 
Marks, and summoned him. He's not going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, 
now?" 

"Don't worry about us." said one of the Death Eaters, "worry about yourself, breaking curfew!" 

"And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pub's closed down? What will

��401ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

happen to your little sidelines��ҵ 
then?" 

"Are you threatening -?" 

"I keep my mouth shut, it's why you come here, isn't it?" 

"I still say I saw a stag Patronus!" shouted the first Death Eater. 

"Stag?" roared the barman. "It's a goat, idiot!" 

"All right, we made a mistake," said the second Death Eater. "Break curfew again and we won't 

be so lenient!" 

The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out 
from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled 
the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the 
bar, then climbing the stairs. 

Harry's attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece, a small, rectangular mirror, 

propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl. 

The barman entered the room. 

"You bloody fools," he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. "What were you 

thinking, coming here?" 

"Thank you," said Harry. "We can't thank you enough. You saved our lives!" 

The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face, trying to see past the long, 

stringy, wire-gray hair beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a 

piercing, brilliant blue. 

"It's your eye I've been seeing in the mirror." 

There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other. 

"You sent Dobby." 

The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. "Thought he'd be with you. Where've you left 

him? 

��He��s dead,�� said Harry, ��Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.�� 

The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, "I'm sorry to hear it, I liked that 

elf." 

He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them. 

"You're Aberforth," said Harry to the man's back.

��402ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire. 

"How did you get this?" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius's mirror, the twin of the one he 
had broken nearly two years before. 

"Bought it from Dung 'bout a year ago," said Aberforth. "Albus told me what it was. Been trying 
to keep an eye out for you." 

Ron gasped. "The silver doe," he said excitedly, "Was that you too?" 

"What are you talking about?" asked Aberforth. 

"Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!" 

"Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven't I just prove my Patronus is a goat?" 

"Oh," said Ron, "Yeah, well, I'm hungry!" he added defensively as his stomach gave an 

enormous rumble. 

"I got food," said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a 
large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in 
front of the fire. 

Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the fire, 
and the clink of goblets and the sound of chewing. 

"Right then," said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat slumped 
cozily in their chairs. "We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can't be done by 
night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness, Caterwauling Charm's 
set off, they'll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don't reckon I'll be able to pass of a 
stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak 
back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you'll be able 
to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He's been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since 
they tried to arrest him." 

"We're not leaving," said Harry. "We need to get into Hogwarts." 

"Don't be stupid, boy," said Aberforth. 

"We've got to," said Harry. 

"What you've got to do," said Aberforth, leaning forward, "is to get as far from here as you can." 

"You don't understand. There isn't much time. We've got to get into the castle. Dumbledore -I 
mean, your brother - wanted us -"

��403ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth's glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat 
white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog. 

"My brother Albus wanted a lot of things," said Aberforth, "and people had a habit of getting 
hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of 
the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He's gone where none of this can 
hurt him, and you don't owe him anything." 

"You don't understand." said Harry again. 

"Oh, don't I?" said Aberforth quietly. "You don't think I understood my own brother? Think you 
know Albus better than I did?" 

"I didn't mean that," said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit
��ʳ���� 
of food and wine. 

"It's... he left me a job." 

"Did he now?" said Aberforth. "Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you'd expect an 

unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?" 

Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. 

"I -it's not easy, no," said Harry. "But I've got to -" 

"Got to? Why got to? He's dead, isn't he?" said Aberforth roughly. "Let it go, boy, before you 

follow him! Save yourself!" 

"I can't." 

"Why not?" 

"I -" Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. "But you're 

fighting too, you're in the Order of the Phoenix -" 

"I was," said Aberforth. "The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who's won, it's over, 
and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves. It'll never be safe for you here, Potter, 
he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you." 
He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. 

"They'll be in danger as long as they live now everyone knows they've been working with you." 

"I can't leave," said Harry. "I've got a job -" 

"Give it to someone else!" 

"I can't. It's got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all -" 

��404ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?" 

Harry wanted with all his heart to say "Yes," but somehow the simple word would not rise to his 
lips. Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. 

"I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how 
we grew up, and Albus... he was a natural." The old man's eyes traveled to the painting of the girl 
over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. 
There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else. 

"Mr. Dumbledore" said Hermione rather timidly. "Is that your sister? Ariana? 

"Yes." said Aberforth tersely. "Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?" 

Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red. 

"Elphias Doge mentioned her to us," said Harry, trying to spare Hermione. 

"That old berk (British Slang) idiot, stupid person)," muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of 
mead. "Thought the sun shone out of my brother's every office, he did. Well, so did plenty of 
people, you three included, by the looks of it." 

Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that 
had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby's grave, he had 
decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to 
accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no 
desire to doubt again; he did not want to hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. 
He met Aberforth's gaze, which was so strikingly like his brothers', The bright blue eyes gave the 
same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that 
Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it. 

"Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much," said Hermione in a low voice. 

"Did he now?" said Aberforth. "Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about 
very much ended up in a worse state than if he'd left 'em well alone." 

"What do you mean?" asked Hermione breathlessly. 

"Never you mind," said Aberforth. 

"But that's a really serious thing to say!" said Hermione. "Are you -are you talking about your 
sister?" 

Aberforth glared at her, his lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back.

��405ҳ��

Then he burst into speech. 

"When my sister was six years old, she was attacked by three Muggle boys. They'd seen her 
doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge, She was a kid, she couldn't control it, no 
witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way 
through the hedge, and when she couldn't show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to 
stop the little freak doing it." 

Hermione's eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as 
Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain. 

"It destroyed her, what they did. She was never right again. She wouldn't use magic, but she 
couldn't get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't 
control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and 
harmless. 

"And my father went after the bastards that did it," said Aberforth, "and attacked them. And they 
locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because if the Ministry had 
known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St. Mungo's for good. They'd have 
seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with 
magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn't keep it in any longer. 

"We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother 
looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy. 

"I was her favourite," he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through 
Aberforth's wrinkles and tangled beard. "Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he 
was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with 
"the most notable magical names of the day," Aberforth sneered. "He didn't want to be bothered 
with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn't do it for my mother, I could 
calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me 
feed the goats. 

"Then, when she was fourteen... See, I wasn't there." said Aberforth. "If I'd been there, I could 
have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn't as young as she was, 
and ... it was an accident. Ariana couldn't control it. But my mother was killed." 

Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but

Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; 
whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it. 

"So that put paid to (frustrate, put a stop to) Albus's trip round the world with little Doge. The 
pair of 'em came home for my mother's funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus 
settled down as head of the family. Ha!" Aberforth spat into the fire. 

"I'd have looked after her, I told him so. I didn't care about school. I'd have stayed home and 
done it. He told me I had to finish my education and he'd take over from my mother. Bit of a 
comedownʧ�� 
for Mr. Brilliant, there's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping 
her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks ... till he came." 

And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth��s face. 

"Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to, someone just as bright and 
talented as he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all 
their plans for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were 
so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl neglected, 
what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good? 

"But after a few weeks of it, I'd had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go hack to 
Hogwarts, so I told 'em, both of 'em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now," and Aberforth looked 
downward Harry, and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, 
confronting his elder brother. 

"I told him, you'd better give it up now. You can't move her, she's in no fit state, you can't take 
her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, when you're making your clever speeches, 
trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn't like that." said Aberforth, and his eyes were 
briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses. They turned white and blind again. 
"Grindelwald didn't like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying 
to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother ... Didn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't 
have to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the 
Muggles their place? 

"And there was an argument ... and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the 
Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother's best friend -and Albus was trying to stop him, and 
then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn't

stand it -" 

The color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal wound. 

"-and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, and I don't 

know which of us did it, it could have been any of us - and she was dead." 

His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione's face 
was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion, He 
wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean of it. 

"I'm so ... I'm so sorry," Hermione whispered. 

"Gone," croaked Aberforth. "Gone forever." 

He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat. 

"'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own 
country, and he didn't want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of 

the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the -" 

"He was never free," said Harry. 

"I beg your pardon?" said Aberforth. 

"Never," said Harry. "The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of 
his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn't there. 'Don't hurt them, 
please ... hurt me instead.'" 

Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had 
happened on the island on the lake. 

The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed 
it so thoroughly. 

"He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did," said Harry, 
remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. 

"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana ... It was torture to him, if 
you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free." 

Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause 
he said. "How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good 
than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?" 

A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart.

��408ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry," said Hermione. 

"Why didn't he tell him to hide, then?" shot back Aberforth. "Why didn't he say to him, 'Take 
care of yourself, here's how to survive'?" 

"Because," said Harry before Hermione could answer, "sometimes you've got to think about 
more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!" 

"You're seventeen, boy!" 

"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!" 

"Who says I've given up?" 

"The Order of the Phoenix is finished," Harry repeated, "You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and 

anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves." 

"I don't say I like it, but it's the truth!" 

"No, it isn't." said Harry. "Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the 

knowledge on to me. I'm going to keep going until I succeed -or I die. Don't think I don't know 

how this might end. I've known it for years." 

He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely scowled. 

"We need to get into Hogwarts," said Harry again. "If you can't help us, we'll wait till daybreak, 
leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us -well, now would be a 
great time to mention it." 

Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that were so extraordinarily 
like his brother's. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and 
approached the portrait of Ariana. 

"You know what to do," he said. 

She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, out of the sides of 
their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her 
slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness. 

"Er - what - ?" began Ron. 

"There's only one way in now," said Aberforth. "You must know they've got all the old secret 
passageways covered at both ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside 
the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you 
expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his

deputies... well, that's your lookoutǰ;, isn't it? You say you're prepared to die." 

"But what ...?" said Hermione, frowning at Ariana's picture. 

A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back 
toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, 
someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than 
Harry had ever seen. He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were 
ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled 
the portrait. 

Then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real 
tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the 
real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled. 

"I knew you'd come! I knew it, Harry!"

Chapter Twenty-Nine 

The Lost Diadem 

��Neville - what the - how - ?�� 
But Neville had spotted Ron and 



Hermione, 
and with yells of delight was hugging them 

too. The 
longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he 

appeared. 
One of his eyes was swollen yellow and 

purple, there 
were gouge marks on his face, and his general 

air of 
unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with 
happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, ��I knew you��d come! Kept telling Seamus it 
was a matter of time!��

 ��Neville, what��s happened to you?�� 

��What? This?�� Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. ��This is nothing, 
Seamus is worse. You��ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,�� he turned to Aberforth, ��Ab, there 
might be a couple more people on the way.�� 

��Couple more?�� repeated Aberforth ominously. ��What d��you mean, a couple more, 
Longbottom? There��s a curfew and a Camwaulding Charm on the whole village!�� 

��I know, that��s why they��ll be Apparating directly into the bar,�� said Neville. ��Just send them 
down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.�� 

Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into 
the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth.

 ��I don��t know how to thank you. You��ve saved our lives twice.��

 ��Look after 'em, then,�� said Aberforth gruffly. ��I might not be able to save 'em a third time.�� 

Harry chambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Ariana��s portrait. There 
were smooth stone steps on the other side. It looked as though the passageway had been there for 
years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, 
their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall. 

��How long��s this been here?�� Ron asked as they set off. ��It isn��t on the Marauder��s Map, is it 
Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of school?��

��411ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,�� said Neville. ��There��s no chance of 
getting through any of them now, not with the curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and 
dementors waiting at the exits.�� He started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. ��Never 
mind that stuff ... Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It��s 
everywhere, everyone��s talking about it. Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in 
the Great Hall at dinner!��

 ��Yeah, it��s true,�� said Harry.

 Neville laughed gleefully. ��What did you do with the dragon?��

 ��Released it into the wild,�� said Ron. ��Hermione was all for keeping it as a pet.��

 ��Don��t exaggerate, Ron �C�� 

��But what have you been doing? People have been saying you��ve just been on the run, Harry, 
but I don��t think so. I think you��ve been up to something.��

 ��You��re right,�� said Harry, ��but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven��t heard anything.�� 

��It��s been, well, it��s not really like Hogwarts anymore,�� said Neville, the smile fading from his 

face as he spoke. ��Do you know about the Carrows?��

 ��Those two Death Eaters who teach here?�� 

��They do more than teach,�� said Neville. ��They��re in charge of all discipline. They like 

punishment, the Carrows.��

 ��Like Umbridge?�� 

��Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if 
we do anything wrong. They don��t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as 
much as we do.�� 

��Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it��s 
just the Dark Arts. We��re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who��ve earned 
detentions �C��

 ��What?��

 Harry, Ron, and Hermione��s united voices echoed up and down the passage. 

��Yeah,�� said Neville. ��That��s how I got this one,�� he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his 
cheek, ��I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time 
they��ve ever been top in anything, I expect.��

��412ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Alecto, Amycus��s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We��ve 
all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drive 
wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. 
I got this one,�� he indicated another slash to his face, ��for asking her how much Muggle blood she 
and her brother have got.��

 ��Blimey, Neville,�� said Ron, ��there��s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.�� 

��You didn��t see her,�� said Neville. ��You wouldn��t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps 
when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, 
Harry.�� 

��But they��ve used you as a knife sharpener,�� said Ron, winding slightly as they passed a lamp 
and Neville��s injuries were thrown into even greater relief. 

Neville shrugged. ��Doesn��t matter. They don��t want to spill too much pure blood, so they��ll 
torture us a bit if we��re mouthy but they won��t actually kill us.�� 

Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact 
tone in which he said them. 

��The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are 
giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The 
Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas.��

 ��Neville, she��s all right, we��ve seen her �C��

 ��Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.�� 

From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons 
that Dumbledore��s Army had used to send one another messages. 

��These have been great,�� said Neville, beaming at Hermione. ��The Carrows never rumbled 
(Slang) understand, discover) how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak 
out at night and put graffiti on the walls, Dumbledore��s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. 
Snape hated it.��

 ��You used to?�� said Harry, who had noticed the past tense. 

��Well, it got more difficult as time went on,�� said Neville. ��We lost Luna at Christmas, and 
Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows 
seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then

Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they��d chained up, and they tortured him 

pretty badly. That scared people off.��

 ��No kidding,�� muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward. 

��Yeah, well, I couldn��t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds 

of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. 

That��s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.��

 ��They what?�� said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. 

��Yeah,�� said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, ��well, 
you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to 
behave. I s��pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was,�� 
he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, ��they bit off a bit more than 
they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn��t need to 
send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,�� Neville laughed, ��Dawlish is still in St. Mungo��s and 
Gran��s on the run. She sent me a letter,�� he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, 
��telling me she was proud of me, that I��m my parent��s son, and to keep it up.��

 ��Cool,�� said Ron. 

��Yea,�� said Neville happily. ��Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, 
they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don��t know whether they were planning to 
kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to disappear.�� 

��But,�� said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, ��aren��t �C aren��t we heading straight back for 

Hogwarts?��

 ��'Course,�� said Neville. ��You��ll see. We��re here.�� 

They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another short flight 

of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana��s portrait. Neville pushed it open and 

climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out for unseen people, 

 ��Look who it is! Didn��t I tell you?�� 

As Harry emerged into the room behind the passage, there were several screams and yells, 
��HARRY!�� ��It��s Potter, it��s POTTER!�� ��Ron!�� ��Hermione!�� 

He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. The next moment 
he, Ron and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands

��414ҳ��

shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people. They might have just won a Quidditch 
final. 

��Okay, okay, calm down!�� Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry was able to 
take in their surroundings. 

He did not recognize the dorm at all. It was enormous, and looked rather like the interior of a 
particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship��s cabin. Multicolored hammocks 
were strung from the ceiling and from the balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and 
windowless walls, which were covered in bright tapestry hangings. Harry saw the gold Gryffindor 
lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze 
eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were 
bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wood-
cased wireless. 

 ��Where are we?��

 ��Room of Requirement, of course!�� said Neville. ��Surpassed itself, hasn��t it? The Carrows were 
chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout, I managed to get through the door and 
this is what I found! Well, it wasn��t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there 
was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it��s expanded as more and more of the 

D.A. have arrived.�� 
��And the Carrows can��t get in?�� asked Harry, looking around for the door. 
��No,�� said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke, Seamus��s face 
was bruised and puffy. ��It��s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can��t get at 
us, the door won��t open. It��s all down to Neville. He really gets this room. You��ve got to ask for 
exactly what you need �C like, 'I don��t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in' �C and it��ll 
do it for you! You��ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes. Neville��s the man!�� 

��It��s quite straightforward, really,�� said Neville modestly. ��I��d been in here about a day and a 
half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that��s when the 
passage to Hog��s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He��s been providing us 
with food, because for some reason, that��s the one thing the room doesn��t really do.�� 

��Yeah, well, food��s one of the five exceptions to Gamp��s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,�� 
said Ron to general astonishment.

��415ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��So we��ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,�� said Seamus, ��and it just makes more 
hammocks every time we need room, and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls 
started turning up �C�� 

��-and thought they��d quite like to wash, yes,�� supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not 
noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces. 
Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and 
Michael Corner. 

��Tell us what you��ve been up to, though,�� said Ernie. ��There��ve been so many rumors, we��ve 
been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch.�� He pointed at the wireless. ��You didn��t break 
into Gringotts?��

 ��They did!�� said Neville. ��And the dragon��s true too!��

 There was a smattering (bit) of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow. 

 ��What were you after?�� asked Seamus eagerly. 

Before any of them could parry����,�ܿ� the question with one of their own, Harry felt a 
terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious and 
delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone 
shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred (exhume, unearth) 
golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort��s scream of fury vibrated inside his 
head. 

With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort��s mind again, back to where he stood, 
swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up. 

��Are you all right, Harry?�� Neville was saying. ��What to sit down? I expect you��re tired, aren��t 
-?�� 

��No,�� said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without words that 
Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast. 
If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance.

 ��We need to get going,�� he said, and their expressions told him that they understood.

 ��What are we going to do, then, Harry?�� asked Seamus. ��What��s the plan?�� 

��Plan?�� repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing 
again to Voldemort��s rage. His scar was still burning. ��Well, there��s something we �C Ron,

��416ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hermione, and I �C need to do, and then we��ll get out of here.�� 

Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused. ��What d��you mean, 'get 
out of here'?�� 

��We haven��t come back to stay,�� said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the pain. 
��There��s something important we need to do �C��

 ��What is it?��

 ��I �C I can��t tell you.�� 

There was a ripple of muttering at this, Neville��s brows contracted. ��Why can��t you tell us? It��s 

something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?��

 ��Well, yeah �C��

 ��Then we��ll help you.�� 

The other members of Dumbledore��s Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, others 
solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate 
action. 

��You don��t understand,�� Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. ��We �C we 

can��t tell you. We��ve got to do it �C alone.��

 ��Why?�� asked Neville. 

��Because...�� In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least have a 
private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry 
found it difficult to gather his thoughts. His scar was still searing. ��Dumbledore left the three of us 
a job,�� he said carefully, ��and we weren��t supposed to tell �C I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the 
three of us.�� 

��We��re his army,�� said Neville. ��Dumbledore��s Army. We were all in it together, we��ve been 

keeping it going while you three have been off on your own �C��

 ��It hasn��t exactly been a picnic, mate,�� said Ron. 

��I never said it had, but I don��t see why you can��t trust us. Everyone in this room��s been 
fighting and they��ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone 
in here��s proven they��re loyal to Dumbledore �C loyal to you.�� 

��Look,�� Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter. The 
tunnel door had just opened behind him.

��417ҳ��

��We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be here!��

 It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend. 

 ��Hi, everyone!�� said Luna happily. ��Oh, it��s great to be back!��

 ��Luna,�� said Harry distractedly, ��what are you doing here? How did you -?�� 

��I sent for her,�� said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. ��I promised her and Ginny that if 
you turned up I��d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. 
That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.��

 ��Of course that��s what it means,�� said Luna brightly. ��Isn��t it, Harry? We��re going to fight them 
out of Hogwarts?�� 

��Listen,�� said Harry with a rising sense of panic, ��I��m sorry, but that��s not what we came back 
for. There��s something we��ve got to do, and then �C��

 ��You��re going to leave us in this mess?�� demanded Michael Corner. 

��No!�� said Ron. ��What we��re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it��s all about trying to get 

rid of You-Know-Who �C��

 ��Then let us help!�� said Neville angrily. ��We want to be a part of it!�� 

There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His heart seemed to fall. Ginny was 
now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. 
Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile. He had forgotten, he had never fully appreciated, how beautiful 
she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her. 

��Aberforth��s getting a bit annoyed,�� said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of 
greeting. ��He wants a kip, and his bar��s turned into a railway station.�� 

Harry��s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry��s old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She 
smiled at him. 

��I got the message,�� she said, holding up her own fake Galleon and she walked over to sit 
beside Michael Corner. 

 ��So what��s the plan, Harry?�� said George. 

��There isn��t one,�� said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, 

unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely.

 ��Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind,�� said Fred. 

��You��ve got to stop this!�� Harry told Neville. ��What did you call them all back for? This is

insane �C�� 

��We��re fighting, aren��t we?�� said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. ��The message said Harry 
was back, and we were going to fight! I��ll have to get a wand, though �C��

 ��You haven��t got a wand -?�� began Seamus.

 Ron turned suddenly to Harry. ��Why can��t they help?��

 ��What?�� 

��They can help.�� He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione, 
who stood between them, ��We don��t know where it is. We��ve got to find it fast. We don��t have to 
tell them it��s a Horcrux.�� 

Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, ��I think Ron��s right. We don��t even 
know what we��re looking for, we need them.�� And when Harry looked unconvinced, ��You don��t 
have to do everything alone, Harry.�� 

Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. Dumbledore had 
warned him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, 
that��s how we grew up, and Albus ... he was a natural ... Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping 
his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had 
that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower ... 

 ��All right,�� he said quietly to the other two. ��Okay,�� he called to the room at large, and all noise 
ceased, Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes (make jokes, tell funny stories) for the 
benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of the looked alert, excited. 

��There��s something we need to find,�� Harry said. ��Something �C something that��ll help us 
overthrow You-Know-Who. It��s here at Hogwarts, but we don��t know where. It might have 
belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone come across 
something with her eagle on it, for instance?�� 

He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, 
but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny��s chair. 

��Well, there��s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost diadem of 
Ravenclaw? Daddy��s trying to duplicate it.�� 

��Yeah, but the lost diadem,�� said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, ��is lost, Luna. That��s sort of 
the point.��

��419ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��When was it lost?�� asked Harry. 

��Centuries ago, they say,�� said Cho, and Harry��s heart sank. ��Professor Flitwick says the 
diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,�� she appealed to her fellow 
Ravenclaws. ��Nobody��s ever found a trace of it, have they?��

 They all shook their heads. 

 ��Sorry, but what is a diadem?�� asked Ron. 

��It��s a kind of crown,�� said Terry Boot. ��Ravenclaw��s was supposed to have magical 
properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.��

 ��Yes, Daddy��s Wrackspurt siphons �C��

 But Harry cut across Luna. ��And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?�� 

They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own 
disappointment was mirrored back at him. 

An object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good 
candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle ... Before he could formulate a new question, 
however, Cho spoke again. 

��If you��d like to see what the diadem��s supposed to look like, I could take you up to our 
common room and show you, Harry. Ravenclaw��s wearing it in her statue.�� 

Harry��s scar scorched again. For a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him, and he 
saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his 
shoulders. Voldemort was flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he 
did not know. Either way, there was hardly any time left. 

��He��s on the move,�� he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at 
them. ��Listen, I know it��s not much of a lead, but I��m going to go look at this statue, at least find 
out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you know �C the other one �C safe.�� 

Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, ��No, Luna will take Harry, won��t you, 

Luna?��

 ��Oooh, yes, I��d like to,�� said Luna happily, as Cho sat down again, looking disappointed.

 ��How do we get out?�� Harry asked Neville.

 ��Over here.�� 

He led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase. ��It

��420ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

comes out somewhere different every day, so they��ve never been able to find it,�� he said. ��Only 
trouble is, we never know exactly where we��re going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, 
they��re always patrolling the corridors at night.��

 ��No problem,�� said Harry. ��See you in a bit.�� 

He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned corners in 
unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall. 

��Get under here,�� Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both 
of them. He gave the wall a little push. 

It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside. Harry glanced back and saw that it had 
resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark corridor. Harry pulled Luna back into the 
shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder��s Map. Holding it 
close to his nose he searched, and located his and Luna��s dots at last. 

��We��re up on the fifth floor,�� he whispered, watching Filch moving away from them, a corridor 

ahead. ��Come on, this way.��

 They crept off. 

Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart hammered that 
fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares of 
moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft 
footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked. Harry and Luna walked, checking 
the Marauder��s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without 
drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst 
fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the 
poltergeist��s approach. 

��This way, Harry,�� breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral 
staircase. 

They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At last they 
reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole, nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, 
and a bronze knocker in the shape an eagle. 

Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, unconnected to arm or 
body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the

��421ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird��s called, a soft, musical voice said, ��Which came 

first, the phoenix or the flame?��

 ��Hmm ... What do you think, Harry?�� said Luna, looking thoughtful.

 ��What? Isn��t there a password?��

 ��Oh no, you��ve got to answer a question,�� said Luna.

 ��What if you get it wrong?�� 

��Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,�� said Luna. ��That way you learn, you 

see?��

 ��Yeah ... Trouble is, we can��t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.�� 

��No, I see what you mean,�� said Luna seriously. ��Well then, I think the answer is that a circle 

has no beginning.��

 ��Well reasoned,�� said the voice, and the door swung open. 

The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had 
ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with 
blue-and-bronze silks. By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding 
mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue 
carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue 
of white marble. 

Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna��s house. The statue 
stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble 
woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet 
slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. 
It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. 
Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw��s plinth to read them.

 ����Wit beyond measure is man��s greatest treasure.����

 ��Which makes you pretty skin, witless,�� said a cackling voice. 

Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The sloping-shouldered 
figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a 
stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm.

Chapter Thirty 
The Sacking of Severus Snape 


The moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry's 


scar burned 
savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and 

he was 
standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, 

and the sea 
was washing around him and there was a triumph in 

his heart �C 
They have the boy. 
A loud bang brought Harry back to where he 

stood. 
Disoriented, he raised his wand, but the witch 

before him 
was already falling forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled. 
��I've never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,�� said Luna, sounding mildly interested. 
��That was noisier than I though it would be.�� 

And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing 
louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories. Luna's spell had woken Ravenclaws 
sleeping above.

 ��Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!�� 

Luna's feet appeared out of nowhere, he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over 
them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the 
common room. There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious. 
Slowly they shuffled in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack 
them. Then one brave little first-year darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe. 

 ��I think she might be dead!�� he shouted with delight. 

��Oh look,�� whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. ��They're 
pleased!��

 ��Yeah... great... �� 

Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort's mind. 
He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave. He had chosen to make sure of the locker 
before coming... but that would not take him long. 

There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the other side,

��423ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker, ��Where do Vanished 
objects go?�� 

��I dunno, do I? Shut it!�� snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of the Carrow 
brother, Amycus, ��Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got him? Open the door!�� 

The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then without warning, there 
came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the door. 

��ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven't got Potter -d'you want to go the same way as the 
Malfoys? ANSWER ME!�� Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did 
not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began 
scampering back up the staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he 
ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a 
second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door. 

 ��May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?��

 ��Trying - to get - through this damned - door!�� shouted Amycus. ��Go and get Flitwick! Get him 
to open it, now!�� 

��But isn't your sister in there�� asked Professor McGonagall. ��Didn't Professor Flitwick let her 
in earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you 
needn't wake up half the castle.��

 ��She ain't answering, you old besomɨ��! You open it! Darn! Do it, now!�� 

��Certainly, if you wish it,�� said Professor McGonagall, with awful coldness. There was a 
genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again.

 ��Where do Vanished objects go?��

 ��Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything,�� replied Professor McGonagall.

 ��Nicely phrased,�� replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open. 

The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the 
threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny 
eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He let out a yell of fury and 
fear. 

��What've they done, the little whelps���� 
?�� he screamed. ��I'll Cruciate the lot of 'em till they 
tell me who did it -and what's the Dark Lord going to say?�� he shrieked, standing over his sister

��424ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist, ��We haven't got him, and they've gone and 
killed her!�� 

��She's only Stunned,�� said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had stooped down to 
examine Alecto. ��She'll be perfectly all right.�� 

��No she bludgering well won't!�� bellowed Amycus. ��Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! 
She's gone and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we've got Potter!��

 ��'Got Potter'?�� said Professor McGonagall sharply, ��What do you mean, 'got Potter'?�� 

��He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him if we caught 

him!��

 ��Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter belongs in my House!�� 

Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice, and affection 

for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him.

 ��We was told he might come in here!�� said Carrow. ��I dunno why, do I?�� 

Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. Twice they passed right 

over the place where Harry and Luna stood. 

��We can push it off on the kids,�� said Amycus, his pig like face suddenly crafty. ��Yeah, that's 
what we'll do. We'll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them kids up there�� -he looked up at 
the starry ceiling toward the dormitories -��and we'll say they forced her to press her Mark, and 
that's why he got a false alarm. He can punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what's the 
difference?�� 

��Only the difference between truth and lied, courage and cowardice,�� said Professor 
McGonagall, who had turned pale, ��a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable 
to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many 
ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.��

 ��Excuse me?�� 

Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, his face 
within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something 
disgusting she had found stuck to the lavatory seat. 

��It's not a case of what you'll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time's over. It's us what's in 
charge here now, and you'll back me up or you'll pay the price.��

��425ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

And he spat in her face.

 Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, ��You shouldn't have done that.��

 As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, ��Crucio!�� 

The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, 
thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into 
the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. 

��I see what Bellatrix meant,�� said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, ��you need to 
really mean it.�� 

��Potter!�� whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. ��Potter-you're here! What -? 
How -?�� She struggled to pull herself together. ��Potter, that was foolish!��

 ��He spat at you,�� said Harry.

 ��Potter, I - that was very - gallant of you - but don't you realize -?�� 

��Yeah, I do,�� Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. ��Professor McGonagall, 

Voldemort's on the way.�� 

��Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?�� asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the 
Invisibility Cloak. The appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor 
McGonagall, who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at the neck of her old 
tartan dressing gown. 

��I don't think it makes any difference what we call him,�� Harry told Luna. ��He already knows 
where I am.�� 

In a distant part of Harry's brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, he could see 
Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat. He had nearly reached the 
island where the stone basin stood. 

 ��You must flee,�� whispered Professor McGonagall, ��Now Potter, as quickly as you can!�� 

��I can't,�� said Harry, ��There's something I need to do. Professor, do you know where the 
diadem of Ravenclaw is?�� 

��The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not -hasn't it been lost for centuries?�� She sat up a 
little straighter. ��Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle -�� 

��I had to,�� said Harry. ��Professor, there's something hidden here that I'm supposed to find, and 
it could be the diadem - if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick -��

��426ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass. Amycus was coming round. Before Harry 
or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death 
Eater, and said, ��Imperio.�� 

Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled obediently to 
Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. Then he lay down on the floor 
beside Alecto. 

Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared 
out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly together. 

��Potter,�� said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with superb indifference to the 
Carrows' predicament. ��if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does indeed know that you are here -�� 

As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry, setting his scar on fire, 
and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no 
golden locket lay safe beneath the surface. 

��Potter, are you all right.�� said a voice, and Harry came back. He was clutching Luna's shoulder 
to steady himself. 

��Time's running out, Voldemort's getting nearer, Professor, I'm acting on Dumbledore's orders, 
I must find what he wanted me to find! But we've got to get the students out while I'm searching 
the castle. It's me Voldemort wants, but he won't care about killing a few more or less, not now -�� 
not now he knows I'm attacking Horcruxes, Harry finished the sentence in his head. 

��You're acting on Dumbledore's orders?�� she repeated with a look of dawning wonder. Then 
she drew herself up to her fullest height. 

��We shall secure the school against He Who Must Not Be Named while you search for this this 
object.��

 ��Is that possible?�� 

��I think so,�� said Professor McGonagall dryly, ��we teachers are rather good at magic, you 

know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of 

course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape -��

 ��Let me -�� 

��-and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would 

indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo

��427ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the grounds -�� 

��There's a way,�� said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway leading into the 
Hog's Head. 

 ��Potter, we're talking about hundreds of students -�� 

��I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school 

boundaries they won't be interested in anyone who's Disapparating out of Hog's Head.�� 

��There's something in that,�� she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Carrows, and a silver net 
fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and hoisted them into the air, where they 
dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures. ��Come. We must alert 
the other Heads of House. You'd better put that Cloak back on.�� 

She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip burst three 
silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the 
spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and Luna hurried back down. 

Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them. Professor 
McGonagall's tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her 
under the Cloak. 

They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps joined theirs. Harry, 
whose scar was still prickling, heard them first. He felt in the pouch around his neck for the 
Marauder's Map, but before he could take it our, McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their 
company. She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, ��Who's there?��

 ��It is I,�� said a low voice. 

 From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape. 

Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him. He had forgotten the details of Snape's 
appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains 
around his thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, 
but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight.

 ��Where are the Carrows?�� he asked quietly.

 ��Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,�� said Professor McGonagall. 

Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as 
if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held his wand up too, ready to attack.

��428ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I was under the impression,�� said Snape, ��That Alecto had apprehended an intruder.��

 ��Really?�� said Professor McGonagall. ��And what gave you that impression?�� 

Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into 
his skin. 

��Oh, but naturally,�� said Professor McGonagall. ��You Death Eaters have your own private 
means of communication, I forgot.�� 

Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air all about her, and he 
was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing.

 ��I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors Minerva.��

 ��You have some objection?��

 ��I wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour?��

 ��I thought I heard a disturbance,�� said Professor McGonagall.

 ��Really? But all seems calm.��

 Snape looked into her eyes.

 ��Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have. I must insist -�� 

Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed. Her wand slashed through 
the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the 
swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance. She brandished 
her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket. Harry, about to curse Snape, was 
forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled 
the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape. 

Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which 
re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers. Snape avoided them 
only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one 
after another, into its breast. 

��Minerva!�� said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying 
spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their 
nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.

 ��No!�� squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. ��You'll do no more murder at Hogwarts!�� 

Flitwick's spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken shelter. With a clatter it

��429ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

came to life. 

Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers. 

Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When 
Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering 
after him. He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, 
��Coward! COWARD!��

 ��What's happened, what's happened?�� asked Luna. 

Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak 
behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were 
standing at a smashed window. 

 ��He jumped,�� said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room. 

��You mean he's dead?�� Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick's and Sprout's yells of 
shock at his sudden appearance. 

��No, he's not dead,�� said McGonagall bitterly. ��Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a 
wand... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.�� 

With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, bat-like shape flying through the 
darkness toward the perimeter wall. 

There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing. Slughorn had just caught 
up. 

��Harry!�� he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-green silk pajamas. ��My 
dear boy... what a surprise... Minerva, do please explain... Severus... what...?�� 

��Our headmaster is taking a short break,�� said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snapeshaped 
hole in the window. 

��Professor!�� Harry shouted, his hand on his forehead. He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding 
beneath him, and he felt a ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort 
lept from it with murder in his heart.

 ��Professor, we've got to barricade the school, he's coming now!�� 

��Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,�� she told the other teachers. Sprout and 
Flitwick gasped. Slughorn let out a low groan. ��Potter has work to do in the castle on 
Dumbledore's orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while

��430ҳ��

Potter does what he needs to do.�� 

��You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who 
indefinitely?�� squeaked Flitwick.

 ��But we can hold him up.�� said Professor Sprout. 

��Thank you, Pomona,�� said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a 
look of grim understanding. ��I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather 
our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are 
over age wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.�� 

��Agreed,�� said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. ��I shall meet you in the 
Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.�� 

And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, ��Tentacula, Devil's Snare. And 
Snargaluff pods... yes, I'd like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.�� 

��I can act from here,�� said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he pointed his 
wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry 
heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the 
grounds. 

��Professor,�� Harry said, approaching the little Charms master. ��Professor, I'm sorry to interrupt, 
but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?�� 

��-Protego Horribillis -the diadem of Ravenclaw?�� squeaked Flitwick. ��A little extra wisdom 
never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!��

 ��I only meant - do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it?��

 ��Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy.��

 Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then, was the Horcrux? 

��We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!�� said Professor 

McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her. 

 They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech. 

��My word,�� he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver. ��What a to-do (Informal) 
panic, fuss)! I'm not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, you 
know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in the most grievous peril -�� 

��I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes also.�� said Professor

��431ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

McGonagall. ��If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you 
attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we 
duel to kill.��

 ��Minerva!�� he said, aghast. 

��The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,�� interrupted Professor 
McGonagall. ��Go and wake your students, Horace.�� 

Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter. He and Luna stayed after Professor McGonagall, 
who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand. 

��Piertotum-oh, for heaven's sake, Filch, not now -�� 

The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting ��Students out of bed! Students 
in the corridors!�� 

��They're supposed to be, you blithering idiot!�� shouted McGonagall. ��Now go and do 
something constructive! Find Peeves!��

 'P-Peeves?�� stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before. 

��Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven't you been complaining about him for a quarter of a 
century? Go and fetch him, at once.�� 

Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, 
hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath. 

��And now -Piertotum Locomator!�� cried Professor McGonagall. And all along the corridor the 
statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the 
floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same. 

��Hogwarts is threatened!�� shouted Professor McGonagall. ��Man the boundaries, protect us, do 
your duty to our school!�� 

Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry, some of them 
smaller, others larger than life. There were animals too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished 
swords and spiked balls on chains. 

��Now, Potter,�� said McGonagall., ��you and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends 
and bring them to the Great Hall - I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.�� 

They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna turning back toward the concealed 
entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing

��432ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and 

prefects.

 ��That was Potter!��

 ��Harry Potter!�� 

��It was him, I swear, I just saw him!�� 

But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement, 

Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back 

down the steep staircase.

 ��Wh-?�� 

As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was packed, far more 
crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were 
Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley.

 ��Harry, what's happening?�� said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs. 

��Voldemort's on his way, they're barricading the school -Snape's run for it. What are you doing 
here? How did you know? 

��We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore's Army,�� Fred explained. ��You couldn't expect 
everyone to miss the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of 
snowballed.��

 ��What first, Harry?�� called George. ��What's going on?�� 

��They're evacuating the younger kids and everyone's meeting in the Great Hall to get 
organized,�� Harry said. ��We're fighting.�� 

There was a great roar and a surge toward the stairs, he was pressed back against the wall as 
they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army, and 
Harry's old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle. 

��Come on, Luna,�� Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand, she took it and followed 
him back up the stairs. 

The crowd was thinning. Only a little knot of people remained below in the Room of 
Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with Ginny. Around them 
stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill and Fleur.

��433ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��You're underage!�� Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached ��I won't permit 

it! The boys, yes, but you, you've got to go home!��

 ��I won't!��

 Ginny's hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother's grip. 

 ��I'm in Dumbledore's Army-��

 ��A teenagers' gang!��

 ��A teenagers' gang that's about to take him on, which no one else has dared to do!�� said Fred. 

��She's sixteen!�� shouted Mrs. Weasley. ��She's not old enough! What you two were thinking 

bringing her with you -��

 Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves. 

��Mom's right, Ginny,�� said Bill gently. ��You can't do this. Everyone underage will have to 
leave, it's only right.�� 

��I can't go home!�� Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. ��My whole family's here, I 
can't stand waiting there alone and not knowing and -�� 

Her eyes met Harry's for the first time. She looked at him beseechingly, but he shook his head 
and she turned away bitterly. 

��Fine,�� she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog's Head. ��I'll say good-by 
now, then, and -�� 

There was a scuffling and a great thump. Someone else had clambered out of the tunnel, 
overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up on the nearest chair, looked around through 
lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and said, ��Am I too late? Has it started. I only just found out, so I I 
-�� 

Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family. 
There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a 
wildly transparent attempt to break the tension. ��So- 'ow eez leetle Teddy?�� 

Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed to be solidifying, like 

ice.

 ��I - oh yes- he's fine!�� Lupin said loudly. ��yes, Tonks is with him- at her mother's -��

 Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen. 

��Here, I've got a picture?�� Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and

��434ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat 
fists at the camera. 

��I was a fool!�� Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph. ��I was an 
idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a �C a -��

 ��Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,�� said Fred.

 Percy swallowed. ��Yes, I was!��

 ��Well, you can't say fairer than that,�� said Fred, holding his hand out to Percy. 

Mrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, pushed Fred aside, and pulled Percy into a 

strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father.

 ��I'm sorry, Dad,�� Percy said. 

 Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son. 

 ��What made you see sense, Perce?�� inquired George. 

��It's been coming on for a while,�� said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner 
of his traveling cloak. ��But I had to find a way out and it's not so easy at the Ministry, they're 
imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off 
ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am.�� 

��Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,�� said George in a good 
imitation of Percy's most pompous manner. ��Now let's get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death 
Eaters'll be taken.�� 

��So, you're my sister in-law now?�� said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur as they hurried off 

toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and George. 

 ��Ginny!�� barked Mrs. Weasley.

 Ginny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliations to sneak upstairs too. 

��Molly, how about this,�� said Lupin. ��Why doesn't Ginny stay here , then at least she'll be on 

the scene and know what's going on, but she won't be in the middle of the fighting?��

 ��I -��

 ��That's a good idea,�� said Mr. Weasley firmly, ��Ginny, you stay in this room, you hear me?�� 

Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father's unusually stern gaze, she 
nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off to the stairs as well.

 ��Where's Ron?�� asked Harry, ��Where's Hermione?��

��435ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��They must have gone up the Great Hall already,�� Mr. Weasley called over his shoulder.

 ��I didn't see them pass me,�� said Harry.

 ��They said something about a bathroom,�� said Ginny, ��not long after you left.��

 ��A bathroom?�� 

Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of Requirement and 

checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty.

 ��You're sure they said bath -?�� 

But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished. He was looking through the 
high wrought-iron gates with winged boats on pillars at either side, looking through the dark 
grounds toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He 
was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder.

Chapter Thirty-One 
The Battle of Hogwarts 


The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark 


and scattered 
with stars, and below it the four long House tables 

were lined with 
disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others 

in dressing 
gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white 

figures of the 
school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead was fixed 

upon Professor 
McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised 

platform at the 
top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teaches, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, 
and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight. 

"... evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madame Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the 
word, you will organize your House and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation 
point. 

Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the walls, scanning the 
Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and 
shouted; "And what if we want to stay and fight?" 

 There was a smattering���� 
of applause.

 "If you are of age, you may stay." said Professor McGonagall.

 "What about our things?" called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. "Our trunks, our owls?" 

"We have no time to collect possessions." said Professor McGonagall. "The important thing is 
to get you out of here safely."

 "Where's Professor Snape?" shouted a girl from the Slytherin table. 

"He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk (Slang) leave hastily or in a rush; escape)." 
replied Professor McGonagall and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and 
Ravenclaws. 

Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and Hermione.

��437ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake. 

"We have already placed protection around the castle," Professor McGonagall was saying, "but 
it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move 
quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects -" 

But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. It was high, 
cold, and clear. There was no telling from where it came. It seemed to issue from the walls 
themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain dormant there for 
centuries. 

"I know that you are preparing to fight." There were screams amongst the students, some of 
whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound. "Your efforts are 
futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of 
Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood." 

There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that 
seems too huge to be contained by walls. 

"Give me Harry Potter," said Voldemort's voice, "and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry 
Potter and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded. You 
have until midnight."

 The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have 
found Harry, to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose 
from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and 
screamed, "But he's there! Potter's there. Someone grab him!" 

Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in front of him had 
risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the 
same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward 
Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled 
from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves. 

"Thank you, Miss Parkinson." said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. "You will leave 
the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow."

 Harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the 
other side of the Hall. 

��438ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Ravenclaws, follow on!" cried Professor McGonagall. 

Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of 
older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed 
behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall's 
descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on their way.

 "Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!" 

 Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table.

 "Where are Ron and Hermione?"

 "Haven't you found -?" began Mr. Weasley, looking worried. 

But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who 
had remained behind. 

"We've only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast. A battle plan has been 
agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout 
and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers -Ravenclaw, 
Astronomy, and Gryffindor -where they'll have good overview, excellent positions from which to 
work spells. Meanwhile Remus" -he indicated Lupin -"Arthur" -he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, 
sitting at the Gryffindor table -"and I will take groups into the grounds. We'll need somebody to 
organize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school -" 

"Sounds like a job for us." called Fred, indicating himself and George, and Kingsley nodded his 

approval.

 "All right, leaders up here and we'll divide up the troops!" 

"Potter," said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the platform, 
jostling for position, receiving instructions, "Aren't you supposed to be looking for something?" 

 "What? Oh," said Harry, "oh yeah!" 

He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so 
that he could search for it. The inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven 
every other thought from his mind.

 "Then go, Potter, go!" 

 "Right - yeah -" 

He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the entrance hall still

��439ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with 
them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his 
thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his 
thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and 
Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt 
halfway along a passage, where he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the 
Marauder's Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron's of Hermione's names 
anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of 
Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over 
his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate.

 Voldemort thought I'd go to Ravenclaw Tower. 

There it was, a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto Carrow in the 
Ravenclaw common room, and there could be only one explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry 
already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House. 

But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem... and how 
could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found 
the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, 
when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory?

 In living memory... 

Beneath his fingers, Harry's eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the 
way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching 
toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs. 
Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own houses, there 
was much pushing and shouting; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the 
front of the queue, here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called 
desperately for friends or siblings. 

Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as 

loudly as he could over the clamor.

 "Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!" 

He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom of the stairs,

��440ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him.

 "Harry! My dear boy!" 

Nick made to grasp Harry's hands with both of his own; Harry felt as though they had been 

thrust into icy water. 

 "Nick, you've got to help me. Who's the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?" 

 Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.

 "The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require -" 

"It's got to be her - d'you know where she is?" 

 "Let's see...�� 

Nick's head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering over the heads of 

the swarming students. 

 "That's her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair." 

Harry looked in the direction of Nick's transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who 
caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall. 

Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he 
saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from him.

 "Hey - wait - come back!" 

She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry supposed that she was 
beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. 
Close in, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he 
had never spoken. 

 "You're the Gray Lady?"

 She nodded but did not speak.

 "The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?" 

 "That is correct."

 Her tone was not encouraging.

 "Please, I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem."

 A cold smile curved her lips. "I am afraid," she said, turning to leave, "that I cannot help you."

 "WAIT!" 

 He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him. He glanced

��441ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

at his watch as she hovered in front of him. It was a quarter to midnight.

 "This is urgent." he said fiercely. "If that diadem's at Hogwarts, I've got to find it, fast." 

"You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem." she said disdainfully. "Generations of 
students have badgered me -" 

"This isn't about trying to get better marks!" Harry shouted at her, "It's about Voldemort defeating 
Voldemort - or aren't you interested in that?" 

She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated 
as she replied, "Of course I - how dare you suggest -?"

 "Well, help me then!" 

Her composure was slipping. "It -it is not a question of -" she stammered. "-my mother's 

diadem?" 

 "Your mother's?" 

 She looked angry with herself. "When I lived," she said stiffly, "I was Helena Ravenclaw."

 "You're her daughter? But then, you must know what happed to it." 

"While the diadem bestows wisdom," she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together, "I 

doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord -" 

"Haven't I told you, I'm not interested in wearing it!" Harry said fiercely. "There's no time to 
explain -but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you've got to tell 
me anything you know about the diadem!" 

She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and a sense of hopelessness 
engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or 
Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and made to 
turn away when she spoke in a low voice.

 "I stole the diadem from my mother."

 "You - you did what?" 

"I stole the diadem." repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. "I sought to make myself 
cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it." 

He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask, he simply 
listened, hard, as she went on. 

"My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended that she had it

��442ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts. 

"Then my mother fell ill -fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy����ʵ 
,���� 
, she was desperate to 
see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned����ؾܾ� 
his 
advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so." 

 Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head. 

"He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became 
violent. The baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, 
he stabbed me."

 "The Baron? You mean -?" 

"The Bloody Baron, yes," said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal 
a single dark wound in her white chest. ��When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with 
remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these 
centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence ... as he should." she added bitterly.

 "And - and the diadem?" 

"It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward 
me. Concealed inside a hollow tree."

 "A hollow tree?" repeated Harry. "What tree? Where was this?" 

 "A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother's reach." 

"Albania," repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from confusion, and now he 
understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. "You've 
already told someone this story, haven't you? Another student?" 

 She closed her eyes and nodded.

 "I had... no idea... He was flattering. He seemed to... understand... to sympathize...�� 

Yes, Harry thought. Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaw's desire to 
possess fabulous objects to which she had little right. 

"Well, you weren't the first person Riddle wormed things out of." Harry muttered. "He could be 
charming when he wanted...�� 

So, Voldemort had managed to wheedle��ƭ the location of the lost diadem out of the Gray 
Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, 
perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes. 

��443ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

And wouldn't those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when, so much 
later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years? 

But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in that lowly tree. No, 
the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there �C 

 ��- the night he asked for a job!�� said Harry, finishing his thought.

 ��I beg your pardon?�� 

��He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!�� said Harry. 
Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. ��He must��ve hidden the diadem on his way 
up to, or down from, Dumbledore��s office! But it was well worth trying to get the job �C then he 
might��ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor��s sword as well �C thank you, thanks!�� 

Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded the corner back into the 
entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew 
what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it was... 

Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; that suggested that it was not in 
Ravenclaw Tower �C but if not there, where? What hiding place had Tom Riddle discovered inside 
Hogwarts Castle, that he believed would remain secret forever? 

Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down 
the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he 
leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall. 

Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at 
Harry. 
��Hagrid!�� Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound��s attentions as the enormous 

bearded figure clambered to his feet ��What the -?��

 ��Harry, yer here! Yer here!�� 

Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug, then ran back to 
the shattered window. 

��Good boy, Grawpy!�� he bellowed through the hole in the window. ��I��ll see yer in a moment, 
there��s a good lad!�� 

Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a 
weird, keening (2. lament, mourn) scream. He looked down at his watch. It was midnight. The

battle had begun. 

 ��Blimey, Harry,�� panted Hagrid, ��this is it, eh? Time ter fight?��

 ��Hagrid, where have you come from?�� 

��Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,�� said Hagrid grimly. ��Voice carried, didn��t it? 
'Yet got till midnight ter gimme Potter.' Knew yeh mus�� be here, knew that mus�� be happenin��. Get 
down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an�� Grawpy an�� Fang. Smashed our way through the 
boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin�� us, Fang an�� me. Told him ter let me down at the 
castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exactly what I meant, bu�� �C where��s 
Ron an�� Hermione?��

 ��That,�� said Harry, ��is a really good question. Come on.�� 

They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping�����ıĵ��� beside them. Harry 
could hear movement through the corridors all around, running footsteps, shouts; through the 
windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds. 

��Where��re we goin��?�� puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry��s heels, making the floorboards 
quake. 

��I dunno exactly,�� said Harry, making another random turn, ��but Ron and Hermione must be 
around here somewhere.�� 

The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead. The two stone 
gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that 
had sailed through another broken window. Their remains stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry 
leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly. ��Oh, don��t mind me ... I��ll just be 
here and crumble.�� 

Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at 
Xenophilius��s house, wearing that mad headdress �C and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, 
with the stone diadem upon her white curls. 

And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigyФ�� 
;���� 
came 
back to him, that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a 
battered old hat. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly 
stumbled.

 He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him.

Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant enough to 
assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, 
Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, 
Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school �C here at least was a secret area he and 
Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered. 

He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a 
dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants. 

��Mandrakes!�� Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. ��Going to lob them over 
the walls �C they won��t like this!�� 

Harry knew now where to go. He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang galloping behind him. They 
passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in 
ruffs and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each others�� canvases, 
screaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, the whole 
castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it 
was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order. 

��It��s all righ��, Fang �C it��s all righ��!�� yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had taken flight as 
slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog, 
leaving Harry alone. 

He forged on��(��ͣ��)Ŭ��ǰ���� through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, 
and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadrigan, rushed from painting to 
painting beside him, clanking along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony 
cantering behind him.

 ��Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see them off!�� 

Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee 
Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a 
secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole. 

��Nice night for it!�� Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and 
terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls 
everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return 
them to their proper place.

��Potter!��

 Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready.

 ��I��ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!�� 

��I know, we��re evacuating,�� Harry said, ��Voldemort��s �C�� 

���C attacking because they haven��t handed you over, yeah,�� said Aberforth. ��I��m not deaf, the 
whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins 
hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you��ve just sent to safety. Wouldn��t it have been a bit 
smarter to keep 'em here?�� 

��It wouldn��t stop Voldemort,�� said Harry, ��and your brother would never have done it.�� 

Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction. 

Your brother would never have done it... Well, it was the truth, Harry thought as he ran on 
again, Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom. 

And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw 
them, Ron and Hermione; both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with 
a broomstick under his arms.

 ��Where the hell have you been?�� Harry shouted. 

 ��Chamber of Secrets,�� said Ron. 

 ��Chamber �C what?�� said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them. 

��It was Ron, all Ron��s idea!�� said Hermione breathlessly. ��Wasn��t it absolutely brilliant? There 
we were, after we left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid 

of it? We still hadn��t got rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk!��

 ��What the �C?��

 ��Something to get rid of Horcruxes,�� said Ron simply. 

Harry��s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione��s arms, great curved fangs; 
torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk. {�Ƿ�Ӧ����Ron��s and Hermione��s arm} 

��But how did you get in there?�� he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. ��You need to speak 
Parseltongue!�� 

��He did!�� whispered Hermione. ��Show him, Ron!�� Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise. 

��It��s what you did to open the locket,�� he told Harry apologetically. ��I had to have a few goes 
to get it right, but,�� he shrugged modestly, ��we got there in the end.��

��447ҳ��

��He was amazing!�� said Hermione. ��Amazing!��

 ��So ...�� Harry was struggling to keep up. ��So ...�� 

��So we��re another Horcrux down,�� said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled 
remains of Hufflepuff��s cup. ��Hermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn��t had the 
pleasure yet.�� 

��Genius!�� yelled Harry. 

��It was nothing,�� said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. ��So what��s new with 
you?�� 

As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead. All three of them looked up as dust fell 
from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream. 

��I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,�� said Harry, talking fast. ��He hid it 
exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone��s been hiding stuff for centuries. He 
thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.�� 

As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down 
the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was empty except for three women, Ginny, Tonks 
and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry recognized immediately as Neville��s 
grandmother. 

��Ah, Potter,�� she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. ��You can tell us what��s going 
on.�� 

��Is everyone okay?�� said Ginny and Tonks together.

 ����S far as we know,�� said Harry. ��Are there still people in the passage to the Hog��s Head?��

 He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it. 

��I was the last to come through,�� said Mrs. Longbottom. ��I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it 
open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?��

 ��He��s fighting,�� said Harry. 

��Naturally,�� said the old lady proudly. ��Excuse me, I must go and assist him.�� With surprising 

speed she trotted off toward the stone steps. 

 Harry looked at Tonks. 

 ��I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother��s?�� 

��I couldn��t stand not knowing �C�� Tonks looked anguished. ��She��ll look after him �C have you

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

seen Remus?�� 

��He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds �C��

 Without another word, Tonks sped off. 

��Ginny,�� said Harry, ��I��m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can 
come back in.��

 Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary. 

��And then you can come back in!�� he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks. 
��You��ve got to come back in!��

 ��Hang on a moment!�� said Ron sharply. ��We��ve forgotten someone!�� 

��Who?�� asked Hermione.

 ��The house-elves, they��ll all be down in the kitchen, won��t they?�� 

��You mean we ought to get them fighting?�� asked Harry. 

��No,�� said Ron seriously, ��I mean we should tell them to get out. We don��t want anymore 
Dobbies, do we? We can��t order them to die for us �C�� 

There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione��s arms. Running at Ron, she 
flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and 
broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her 
feet. 

��Is this the moment?�� Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and 
Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. ��Oi! 
There��s a war going on here!�� 

Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. 

��I know, mate,�� said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the 
head with a Bludger, ��so it��s now or never������ʧ����ʧ����, isn��t it?�� 

��Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?�� Harry shouted. ��D��you think you could just �C just 
hold it in until we��ve got the diadem?�� 

��Yeah �C right �C sorry �C�� said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink 
in the face. 

It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that 
they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated

��449ҳ��

severely. The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the 
nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he 
knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Looking down, Harry saw Grawp 
the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and 
roaring his displeasure.

 ��Let��s hope he steps on some of them!�� said Ron as more screams echoed from close by. 

��As long as it��s not any of our lot!�� said a voice, Harry turned and saw Ginny and Tonks, both 
with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched, 
Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below. 

��Good girl!�� roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth 
again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past. ��They look like they might be 
breaching the north battlements, they��ve brought giants of their own.��

 ��Have you seen Remus?�� Tonks called after him.

 ��He was dueling Dolohov,�� shouted Aberforth, ��haven��t seen him since!�� 

��Tonks,�� said Ginny, ��Tonks, I��m sure he��s okay �C��

 But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth. 

 Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 

��They��ll be all right,�� said Harry, though he knew they were empty words. ��Ginny, we��ll be 
back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe �C come on!�� he said to Ron and Hermione, 
and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do 
the bidding of the next entrant. 

I need the place where everything is hidden. Harry begged of it inside his head, and the door 
materialized on their third run past. 

The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind 
them. All was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its 
towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone students. 

��And he never realized anyone could get in?�� said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence. ��He 
thought he was the only one,�� said Harry. ��Too bad for him I��ve had to hide stuff in my time ... 
this way,�� he added. ��I think it��s down here.�� 

They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others�� footsteps echoing through the

��450ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats... 

��Somewhere near here,�� Harry muttered to himself. ��Somewhere ... somewhere ...�� 

Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized from his one 
previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to 
shiver. There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potions 
book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked 
like an ancient discolored tiara. 

He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained few feet away, when a voice behind 
him said, ��Hold it, Potter.�� 

He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him, shoulder 
to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the small space between their jeering faces he 
saw Draco Malfoy. 

��That��s my wand you��re holding, Potter,�� said Malfoy, pointing his own through the gap 
between Crabbe and Goyle. 

��Not anymore,�� panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. ��Winners, keepers, 
Malfoy. Who��s lent you theirs?��

 ��My mother,�� said Draco. 

Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. He could not hear 

Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem.

 ��So how come you three aren��t with Voldemort?�� asked Harry. 

��We��re gonna be rewarded,�� said Crabbe. His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous 
person. Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. Crabbe was speaking like a small child 
promised a large bag of sweets. ��We 'ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you 
to 'im.�� 

��Good plan,�� said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that he was this close, and 
was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging slowly backward 
toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it 
before the fight broke out ... 

 ��So how did you get in here?�� he asked, trying to distract them. 

��I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,�� said Malfoy, his voice brittle. ��I

��451ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

know how to get in.�� 

��We was hiding in the corridor outside,�� grunted Goyle. ��We can do Disslusion Charms now! 
And then,�� his face split into a gormless grin, ��you turned up right in front of us and said you was 
looking for a die-dum! What��s a die-dum?�� 

��Harry?�� Ron��s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry��s right. ��Are you 
talking to someone?�� 

With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of old furniture, 
of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, ��Descendo!�� 

The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where Ron stood. 

��Ron!�� Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed, and Harry heard 
innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall. He pointed his 
wand at the rampart, cried, ��Finite!�� and it steadied. 

��No!�� shouted Malfoy, staying (stop, restrain) Crabbe��s arm as the latter made to repeat his 
spell. ��If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!�� 

��What��s that matter?�� said Crabbe, tugging himself free. ��It��s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who 
cares about a die-dum?�� 

��Potter came in here to get it,�� said Malfoy with ill-disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness 
of his colleagues. ��so that must mean �C�� 

����Must mean?�� Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity. ��Who cares what you 
think? I don��t take your orders no more, Draco. You an�� your dad are finished.�� 

��Harry?�� shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wall. ��What��s going on?�� 

��Harry?�� mimicked Crabbe. ��What��s going on �C no, Potter! Crucio!�� 

Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe��s curse missed him but hit the stone bust, which flew into 
the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which 
the bust had rested. 

��STOP!�� Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room. ��The Dark 
Lord wants him alive �C�� 

��So? I��m not killing him, am I?�� yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy��s restraining arm. ��But if I 
can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what��s the diff �C?�� 

A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches, Hermione had run around the corner behind him

��452ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe��s head. It only missed because Malfoy pulled him out 

of the way. 

��It��s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!�� 

Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from 
his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy��s 
wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones. 

��Don��t kill him! DON��T KILL HIM!�� Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who were both 
aiming at Harry, their split second��s hesitation was all Harry needed. 

��Expelliarmus!�� 

Goyle��s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark (fortress wall) of objects 
beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of 
Hermione��s second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full 
Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed. 

Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, ��Avada Kedavra!�� again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid 
the jet of green light. The wand-less Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione 
charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she came. 

��It��s somewhere here!�� Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara 

had fallen. ��Look for it while I go and help R �C�� 

��HARRY!�� she screamed. 

A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment��s warning. He turned and saw both 

Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them. 

��Like it hot, scum?�� roared Crabbe as he ran. 

But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size were 
pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their 
touch. 

��Aguamenti!�� Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated 
in the air. 

��RUN!�� 

Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now 

looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It

��453ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge. As they turned a 
corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient (conscious), intent upon killing 
them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts, Flaming serpents, 
chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they 
were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, 
before being consumed by the inferno. 

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view, Harry, Ron and Hermione stopped dead; 
the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, 
and the heat was solid as a wall around them. 

��What can we do?�� Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. ��What can we do?�� 

��Here!�� 

Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to 
Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, 
with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a 
flaming raptor���� 
that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming 
overwhelming, Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contrabandΥ��Ʒ of generations 
of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the 
countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, 
or Goyle anywhere. He swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to 
find them, but there was nothing but fire. What a terrible way to die... He had never wanted this... 

��Harry, let��s get out, let��s get out!�� bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see where the 
door was through the black smoke. 

And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion, the 
thunder of devouring flame. 

��It��s �C too �C dangerous �C!�� Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses giving his eyes 
some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb 
or a face that was not yet charred like wood... 

And he saw them, Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched 
on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, 
but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good. Goyle was too heavy and

��454ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Malfoy��s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry��s. 

��IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I��LL KILL YOU, HARRY!�� roared Ron��s voice, and, as a great 
flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and 
rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry. 

��The door, get to the door, the door!�� screamed Malfoy in Harry��s ear, and Harry sped up, 
following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe, 
and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, 
as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration, cups and shields, a sparkling 
necklace, and an old, discolored tiara �C 

��What are you doing, what are you doing, the door��s that way!�� screamed Malfoy, but Harry 
made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering 
as it dropped toward the maw (throat of an animal) of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught 
it around his wrist �C 

Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight toward the 
place where, he prayed, the door stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was 
screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular 
patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they 
collided with the wall in the corridor beyond. 

Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. Harry rolled over 
and sat up. The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat 
panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious. 

��C-Crabbe,�� choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. ��C-Crabbe ...�� 

��He��s dead,�� said Ron harshly. 

There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge bangs shook the 
castle, and a great cavalcade [.k.vl'ke.d]�����н� 
;����� 
of transparent figures galloped past 
on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when 
the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around, The battle was still going on all around him. He 
could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him. 

��Where��s Ginny?�� he said sharply. ��She was here. She was supposed to be going back into the 
Room of Requirement.��

��455ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Blimey, d��you reckon it��ll still work after that fire?�� asked Ron, but he too got to his feet, 
rubbing his chest and looking left and right. ��Shall we split up and look �C?�� 

��No,�� said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly 
on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. ��Let��s stick together. I say we go �C Harry, what��s 
that on your arm?�� 

��What? Oh yeah �C�� 

He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot, but as 
he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it; WIT BEYOND 
MEASURE IS MAN��S GREATEST TREASURE. 

A blood-like substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem. Suddenly Harry 
felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard 
the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the 
thing that had just fragmented in his fingers. 

��It must have been Fiendfyre!�� whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the broken piece. 

��Sorry?�� 

��Fiendfyre �C cursed fire �C it��s one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, 
ever have dared use it, it��s so dangerous �C how did Crabbe know how to �C?�� 

��Must��ve learned from the Carrows,�� said Harry grimly. 

��Shame he wasn��t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,�� said Ron, whose 

hair, like Hermione��s, was singed, and whose face was blackened. ��If he hadn��t tried to kill us all, 

I��d be quite sorry he was dead.�� 

��But don��t you realize?�� whispered Hermione. ��This means, if we can just get the snake �C�� 

But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor. 
Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail, Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and 
Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling masked and hooded men. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help. Jets of light flew in every direction and the man 
dueling Percy backed off, fast. Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked 
hair. 

��Hello, Minister!�� bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his 
wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. ��Did I mention I��m

resigning?�� 

��You��re joking, Perce!�� shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the 
weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes 
erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy 
with glee. 

��You actually are joking, Perce... I don��t think I��ve heard you joke since you were �C�� 

The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the 
two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a 
moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself 
flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood 
that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms, He heard the screams and yells 
of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them. 

And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness. He was half buried in the 
wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of 
the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding 
copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind 
neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more frightened than he had been 
that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life... 

And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded men were 
grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione��s hand as they 
staggered and stumbled over stone and wood. 

��No �C no �C no!�� someone was shouting. ��No! Fred! No!�� 

And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred��s eyes stared 
without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.

Chapter Thirty-Two 
The Elder Wand 


The world had ended, so why had the battle 


not ceased, 
the castle fallen silent in horror, and every 

combatant 
laid down their arms? 
Harry's mind was in free fall, spinning out of 

control, 
unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred 

Weasley 
could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses 

must be 
lying... 
And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them 
from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads. 

"Get down!" Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night, He and Ron had both 
grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred's body, shielding it from 
further harm, and when Harry shouted "Percy, come on, we've got to move!" he shook his head. 

"Percy!" Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron's face as he sezied his elder 
brother's shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. "Percy, you can't do anything for him! 
We're going to -" 

Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of 
a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall. One of Aragog's descendants had 
joined the fight. 

Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was blown backward, its 
legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness. 

"It brought friends!" Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the 
hole in the wall the curses had blasted. More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, 
liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired 
Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled 
back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry's head, so 
close he felt the force of them blow his hair. 

"Let's move, NOW!"

Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred's body under the armpit. 
Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped, together, 
crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the 
way. 

"Here," said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He 
could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body 
was well-hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished but at the 
end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from 
windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could 
not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar, "ROOKWOOD!" and sprinted off in 
the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. 

"Harry, in here!" Hermione screamed. 

She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad 
second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to 
restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy. 

"Listen to me -LISTEN RON!" 

"I wanna help -I wanna kill Death Eaters -" 

His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief. 

"Ron, we're the only ones who can end it! Please �C Ron -we need the snake, we've got to kill the 
snake!" said Hermione. 

But Harry knew how Ron felt. Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of 
revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to 
find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not -but he 
could not permit that idea to form in his mind. 

"We will fight!" Hermione said. "We'll have to... to reach the snake! But let's not lose sight now 
of what we're supposed to be d -doing! We're the only ones who can end it!" 

She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she 
took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry. 
"You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he'll have the snake with him, won't he? Do it, 
Harry, look inside him!"

Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him 
Voldemort's thoughts. He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and bangs and 
all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood 
far, far away from them... 

He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on 
the walls and all the windows boarded up except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle 
were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the 
castle stood, but inside the room was dark except for a solitary oil lamp. He was rolling his wand 
between his figners, watching it, his thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he 
had ever found, the room, like the chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive 
to discover... He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem... although Dumbledore's 
puppet had come much farther than he ever expected... too far... 

"My Lord," said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned, there was Lucius Malfoy sitting in 
the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the 
boy's last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. "My Lord... please... my son...�� 

"If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the 

Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?" 

"No -never," whispered Malfoy. 

"You must hope not." 

"Aren't -aren't you afraid, my Lord that Potter might die at another hand but yours?" asked 
Malfoy, his voice shaking. "Wouldn't it be... forgive me... more prudent to call off this battle, enter 
the castle, and seek him y-yourself?" 

"Do not pretend Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has 
happened to your son. And I do not need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have 
come to find me." Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It troubled 
him... and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rearranged... "Go and fetch 
Snape." 

"Snape, m-my Lord?" 

"Snape. Now. I need him. There is a -service -I require from him. Go." 

Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room. Vodlemort continued to

stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers, staring at it. "It is the only way, Nagini," he 
whispered, and he looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, 
twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry, transparent 
sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank. 

With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes at the same moment his ears were assaulted 
with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle. 

"He's in the Shrieking Shack. The snake's with him, it's got some sort of magical protection 
around it. He's just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape." 

"Voldemort��s sitting in the shrieking Shack?" said Hermione, outraged. "He's not -he's not even 
FIGHTING?" 

"He doesn't think he needs to fight," said Harry. "He thinks I'm going to go to him." 

"But why?" 

"He knows I'm after Horcruxes -he's keeping Nagini close beside him -obviously I'm going to 
have to go to him to get near the thing -" 

"Right," said Ron, squaring his shoulders. "So you can't go, that's what he wants, what he's 
expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I'll go and get it -" 

Harry cut across Ron. "You two stay here, I'll go under the Cloak and I'll be back as soon as I -" 

"No," said Hermione, "it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and -" 

"Don't even think about it," Ron snarled at her. 

Before Hermione could get farther than "Ron, I'm just as capable -" the tapestry at the top of the 

staircase on which they stood was ripped open. 

"POTTER!" Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were fully 
raised, Hermione shouted "Glisseo!" The stairs beneath their feet flatteneed into a chute and she, 
Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters' 
Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom 
and spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall. 

"Duro!" cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening 
crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it. 

"Get back!" shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione hurled themselves against a door as a 
herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherdd by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She

��461ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

appeared not to notice them. Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she 

turned the corner, they heard her scream, "CHARGE!" 

"Harry, you get the Cloak on," said Hermione. "Never mind us -" 

But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were he doubted anyone would see their 
disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, and the shimmer of spells. 
They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits 
on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, 
while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won 
himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron and 
Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting so 
much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as 
they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great "Wheeeeee!" and looking 
up, Harry saw Peeves zoomign over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, 
whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. 

"ARGH!" A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the damp green roots were 
suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose. 

"Someone's invisible there!" shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing. Dean made the most of 
the Death Eater's momentary distraction, knocking him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov 
attempted to retaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him. 

"LET'S GO!" Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around 
themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of 
Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall. 

"I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!" Draco was on the upper landing, pleading 
with anoter masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked 
around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell 
backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused. 

"And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two-faced (hypocrite; disloyal) 
bastard!" Ron yelled. 

There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall, Death Eaters everywhere Harry 
looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling

��462ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying or dragging injured 
friends. Harry directed a Stunnning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit 
Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which 
looped���� 
itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase, glass shattered on the left, and the 
Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people 
slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the 
ground, and a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its 
teeth into one of the fallen. 

"NO!" shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, Fenrir Greyback was 
thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters 
and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on 
top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move. 

"I have more!" shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters. "More for any who want 
them! Here -" And with a move like a tennis serve���� 
, she heaved another enormous crystal 
sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall 
and smash through a window. 

At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders 
forced their way into the front hall. Screams of terror rent the air, the fighters scattered, Death 
Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming 
monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever. 

"How do we get out?" yelled Ron over all the screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione 
could answer they were bowled aside; Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing 
his flowery pink umbrella. 

"Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!" he yelled. 

"HAGRID, NO!" Harry forgot everything else, he sprinted out from under the cloak, running 
bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. 

"HAGRID, COME BACK!" But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen, 
Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they 
retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst.

��463ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"HAGRID!" 

Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did not care, He was 
springint down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with 
their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. 

"HAGRID!" 

He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the mdist of the spider swarm, but 
as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down 
out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up. A giant stood 
before him, twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its tree-like hairy shins 
illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive 
fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the 
shelter of the doorway. 

"Oh my -!" shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the 
giant now trying to seize people through the window above. 

"DON'T!" Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione's hand as she raised her wand. "Stun him and he'll 
crush half the castle -" 

"HAGGER?" Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry realzie 
that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan [g��.'g.nt...n] (enormous, huge) 
monster trying to crush people on the upper floors turned around and let out a rorar. The stone 
steps tremebled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp's lopsided mouth fell open, 
showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the 
savagery of lions. 

"RUN!" Harry roared; the ngiht was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and 
he seized Hermione's hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. 
Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward 
the forest before they were brought up shortֹ����ǰ again. 

The air around them had frozen, Harry's breath caught and solidified in his chest. Shapes moved 
out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the 
castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling... 

Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly

��464ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the 
night, and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead... 

"Come on, Harry!" said Hermione's voice from a very long way away. "Patronuses, Harry, come 
on!" he raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him. 

How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about? He felt as though his soul had already 
half left his body. 

"HARRY, COME ON!" screamed Hermione. 

A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry's 

despair, which was like a promise of a feast... 

He saw Ron's silver terrierһ�ֹ� 
burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw 
Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade, and his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost 
welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling... 

And then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads, the 
dementors fell back before the creatures' approach. Three more people had arrived out of the 
darkness to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast Patronuses, Luna, 
Ernie, and Seamus. 

"That's right," said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and 
this was simply spell practice for the D.A., "That's right, Harry... come on think of something 
happy...�� 

'Something happy?" he said, his voice cracked. 

"We're all still here," she whispered, "we��re still fighting. Come on, now." 

There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost 
him the stag burst from the end of Harry's wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors 
scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding 
battle were loud in his ears. 

"Can't thank you enough," said Ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and Seamus "you just saved 
-" 

With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came lurching out of the darkness from 
the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than any of them. 

"RUN!" Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They all scattered, and not a

��465ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

second too soon��ǰ 
;���� 
, for the next moment the creature's vast foot had fallen exactly where 
they had been standing. 

Harry looked round, Ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished 
back into the battle. 

"Let's get out of range!" yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed 
through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate 
the darkness. 

"The Whomping willow," said Harry, "go!" 

Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not 
look now, thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and 
outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, 
because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it. 

He sprinted, half-believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in 
the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the 
Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have 
risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great 
tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches. Panting 
and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow's swiping branches, peering through the 
darkness toward its tick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would 
paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath that she could not speak. 

"How -how're we going to get in?" panted Ron. "I can��t -see the place -if we jsut had -
Crookshanks again -" 

"Crookshanks?" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. "Are you a wizard, or 
what?" 

"Oh �C right �C yeah -" Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and 
said "Winguardium Leviosa!" 

The twig flew up from the gruond, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then 
zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow's ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a 
place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still. 

"Perfect!" panted Hermione.

��466ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Wait." 

For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air, Harry 
hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to come... Was he leading Ron and 
Hermione into a trap? 

But the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain, the only way forward was to kill the 

snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was, and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel... 

"Harry, we're coming, just get in there!" said Ron, pushing him forward. 

Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree's roots. It was a much tighter squeeze 
than it had been the last time they had entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged, they had had to 
double up to move throuhgh it nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to 
crawl. Harry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none 
came. They moved in silence, Harry's gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his 
fist. 

At last, the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. 

Hermione tugged at his ankle. "The Cloak!" she whispered. "Put the Cloak on!" 

He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand. With 
difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmered, "Nox," extinguishing his wandlight, and 
continued on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every 
second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light. 

And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled 
by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old 
crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap 
left between crate and wall. The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirlign and 
coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported 
in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. 
Then Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched, Snape was inches away from where he crouched, 
hidden. 

"... my Lord, their resistance is crumbling -" 

"-and it is doing so without your help," said Voldemort in his high, clear voice. "Skilled wizard 
though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there...

��467ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

almost." 

"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my Lord. Please." Snape 
strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering 
whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not 
think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away his position... Voldemort stood up. 
Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him 
gleaming slightly in the semidarkness. 

"I have a problem, Severus," said Voldemort softly. 

"My Lord?" said Snape. 

Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor's baton. 
"Why doesn't it work for me, Severus?" 

In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled or 
was it Voldemort's sibilant˻˻������ sigh lingering on the air? 

"My -my lord?" said Snape blankly. "I do not understand. You -you have performed 
extraordinary magic with that wand." 

"No," said Voldemort. "I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand... 
no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the 
one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago." 

Voldemort's tone was musing, calm, but Harry's scar had begun to throb and pulse. Pain was 

building in his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. 

"No difference," said Voldemort again. 

Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered whether Snape sensed danger, 
was trying to find the right words to reassure his master. 

Voldemort started to move around the room, Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, 
speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry. 

"I have thought long and hard, Severus... do you know why I have called you back from battle?" 

And for a moment Harry saw Snape's profile. His eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its 

enchanted cage. 

"No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter." 

"You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He does not need finding.

��468ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Potter will come to me. I knew his weakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the 
others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at 
any cost. He will come." 

"But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourself -" 

"My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends the 
more, the better -but do not kill him. But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry 
Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable." 

"My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But -let me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me 
bring him to you. I know I can -" 

"I have told you, no!" said Voldemort, and Harry caught the light of red in his eyes as he turned 
again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort's 
impatience in his burning scar. 

"My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!" 

"My Lord, there can be no question, surely -?" 

"-but there is a question, Severus. There is." Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly 
again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape. "Why did both the 

wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?" 

"I -I cannot answer that, my Lord." 

"Can't you?" 

The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry's head, he forced his own fist into his 
mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was 
Voldemort, looking into Snape's pale face. 

"My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice 
it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another's wand. I did 
so, but Lucius's wand shattered upon meeting Potter's." 

"I -I have no explanation, my Lord." Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes 
were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. 

"I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it 
from its previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore." 

And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape's face was like a death mask. It was marble

��469ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank 

eyes. 

"My Lord -let me go to the boy -" 

"All this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here," said Voldemort, his 
voice barely louder than a whisper, "wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be 
what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner... and I 
think I have the answer." 

Snape did not speak. 

"Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good 
and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen." 

"My Lord -" 

"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder 

Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you 

live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine." 

"My Lord!" Snape protested, raising his wand. 

"It cannot be any other way," said Voldemort. "I must master the wand, Severus. Master the 

wand, and I master Potter at last." 

And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Sanpe, who for a split 
second seemed to think he had been reprievedִ�л��� 
, but then Voldemort's intention became 
clear. The snake's cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than 
yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. 

"Kill." 

There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape's face losing the little color it had left; it whitened 
as his black eyes widened, as the snake's fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted 
cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. 

"I regret it," said Voldemort coldly. 

He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and 
take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage 
holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood 
gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance,

��470ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. 

Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes. He had drawn blood biting down 
on his knuckles in an effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between 
crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. 

"Harry!" breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate 
blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, 
he pulled himself up into the room. 

He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying man, he did not know 
what he felt as he saw Snape's white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his 
neck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose 
widening black eyes found Harry as he tried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the 
front of his robes and pulled him close. 

A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat. 

"Take... it... Take... it...�� 

Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it 
gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know 
what to do - 

A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hand by Hermione. Harry lfited the 
silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as 
though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes slackened. 

"Look... at... me...�� he whispered. 

The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair 
seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the 
floor, and Snape moved no more.

Chapter Thirty-Three 
The Prince��s Tale 


Harry remained kneeling at Snape��s side, 
down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold 
close to them that Harry jumped on his feet, the 
tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had 
room. 

Voldemort��s voice reverberated from the 


simply staring 
voice spoke so 
flask gripped 
reentered the 

walls and floor, 

and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the 
residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he 
stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow������� 
away. 

��You have fought,�� said the high, cold voice, ��valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value 
bravery. 

��Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. 
I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste.

 ��Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately.

 ��You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. 

��I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you 
rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that 
hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I 
shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, 
woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.��

 Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry.

 ��Don��t listen to him,�� said Ron. 

��It��ll be all right,�� said Hermione wildly. ��Let��s �C let��s get back to the castle, if he��s gone to the 
forest we��ll need to think of a new plan �C�� 

She glanced at Snape��s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed her. Harry 
gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, 
except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done.

��472ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron 
and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could. 

You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one 
hour in the Forbidden Forest... One hour... 

Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. It could only be an hour or so 
from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone clog 
(wooden shoe), the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of 
Grawp or of his attacker. 

The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or 
shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still 
scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters 
had been blown away.

 ��Where is everyone?�� whispered Hermione.

 Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. 

The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in groups, their 
arms around each other��s necks. The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by 
Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood 
and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. 

The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred��s body, because his 
family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred��s 
chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks. 

Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach 
Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who 
flung an arm around Ron��s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the 
family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred. Remus and Tonks, pale and still 
and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling. 

The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the 
doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see 
who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, 
when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died... 

��473ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks... He yearned not to feel... He 
wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him... 

The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in 
the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape��s last thoughts, and 
he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster��s office. 

 ��Password?�� 

��Dumbledore!�� said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to 
his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind. 

But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that hung all 
around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it 
seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could 
have a clear view of what was going on. 

Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore��s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the 
headmaster��s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had 
always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape��s memories into the wide basin with 
its runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else��s head would be a blessed relief... 
Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories 
swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, 
as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived. 

He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he 
saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant 
skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them 
from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched 
that it looked deliberate, too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a 
grown man, an odd smockŮʽ����-like shirt. 

Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, 
stringy. There was undisguised greed̰�� 
,̰�� 
in his thin face as he watched the younger of the 
two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. 

 ��Lily, don��t do it!�� shrieked the elder of the two. 

But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite

��474ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling 
on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze�߿���ǧ 
artist through the air, staying up far 
too long, landing far too lightly.

 ��Mummy told you not to!�� 

Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, making a 
crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. 

 ��Mummy said you weren��t allowed, Lily!��

 ��But I��m fine,�� said Lily, still giggling. ��Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.�� 

Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the 
girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape 
lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until 
Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, 
opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.

 ��Stop it!�� shrieked Petunia. 

��It��s not hurting you,�� said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to 
the ground. 

��It��s not right,�� said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower��s flight to the ground and 
lingered upon it. ��How do you do it?�� she added, and there was definite longing in her voice. 

��It��s obvious, isn��t it?�� Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped out from behind 
the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, 
remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the 
sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily.

 ��What��s obvious?�� asked Lily. 

Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering 
beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, ��I know what you are.��

 ��What do you mean?��

 ��You��re... you��re a witch,�� whispered Snape. 

 She looked affronted. ��That��s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!��

 She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. 

��No!�� said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did not take off the

��475ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He 
flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously bat-like, like his older self. 

The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles, as 
though it was the safe place in tag׽�Բ���Ϸ. 

��You are,�� said Snape to Lily. ��You are a witch. I��ve been watching you for a while. But 
there��s nothing wrong with that. My mum��s one, and I��m a wizard.��

 Petunia��s laugh was like cold water. 

��Wizard!�� she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his 
unexpected appearance. ��I know who you are. You��re that Snape boy! They live down Spinner��s 
End by the river,�� she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a 
poor recommendation. ��Why have you been spying on us?�� 

��Haven��t been spying,�� said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright 

sunlight. ��Wouldn��t spy on you, anyway,�� he added spitefully, ��you��re a Muggle.��

 Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone. 

��Lily, come on, we��re leaving!�� she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape 
as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the 
only one left to observe him, recognized Snape��s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape 
had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong... 

The scene dissolved and, before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was now in a small 
thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the 
trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the 
ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less pecular in the half light.

 ��... and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.��

 ��But I have done magic outside school!�� 

��We��re all right. We haven��t got wands yet. They let you off when you��re a kid and you can��t 
help it. But once you��re eleven,�� he nodded importantly, ��and they start training you, then you��ve 
got to go careful.�� 

There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry 
knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward 
the boy, and said, ��It is real, isn��t it? It��s not a joke? Petunia says you��re lying to me. Petunia says

��476ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

there isn��t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn��t it?��

 ��It��s real for us,�� said Snape. ��Not for her. But we��ll get the letter, you and me.��

 ��Really?�� whispered Lily. 

��Definitely,�� said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he struck an 

oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny.

 ��And will it really come by owl?�� Lily whispered. 

��Normally,�� said Snape. ��But you��re Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to 

come and explain to your parents.��

 ��Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?��

 Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark 

red hair. 

 ��No,�� he said. ��It doesn��t make any difference.��

 ��Good,�� said Lily, relaxing. It was clear that she had been worrying.

 ��You��ve got loads of magic,�� said Snape. ��I saw that. All the time I was watching you...�� 

His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was 

looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in 

the playground.

 ��How are things at your house?�� Lily asked. 

 A little crease appeared between his eyes.

 ��Fine,�� he said.

 ��They��re not arguing anymore?�� 

��Oh yes, they��re arguing,�� said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them 

apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. ��But it won��t be that long and I��ll be gone.��

 ��Doesn��t your dad like magic?��

 ��He doesn��t like anything, much,�� said Snape.

 ��Severus?��

 A little smile twisted Snape��s mouth when she said his name.

 ��Yeah?��

 ��Tell me about the dementors again.��

 ��What d��you want to know about them for?��

��477ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��If I use magic outside school �C�� 

��They wouldn��t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who do really bad 
stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You��re not going to end up in Azkaban, you��re too 
�C�� 

He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made 

him turn, Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing.

 ��Tuney!�� said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet.

 ��Who��s spying now?�� he shouted. ��What d��you want?�� 

Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling for something 
hurtful to say. 

��What is that you��re wearing, anyway?�� she said, pointing at Snape��s chest. ��Your mum��s 
blouse?�� 

There was a crack. A branch over Petunia��s head had fallen. Lily screamed. The branch caught 
Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears.

 ��Tuney!��

 But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. 

 ��Did you make that happen?��

 ��No.�� He looked both defiant and scared. 

 ��You did!�� She was backing away from him. ��You did! You hurt her!��

 ��No �C no, I didn��t!�� 

But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off 

after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused...

 And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around. He was on platform nine and three quarters, and 
Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who 
greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls 
stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister. Harry moved 
closer to listen. 

��... I��m sorry, Tuney, I��m sorry! Listen �C�� She caught her sister��s hand and held tight to it, even 
though Petunia tried to pull it away. ��Maybe once I��m there �C no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I��m 
there, I��ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!��

��478ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I don��t �C want �C to �C go!�� said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister��s 
grasp. ��You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a �C a...�� 

Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewing in their owners�� arms, over the 
owls, fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some already in their long 
black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad 
cries after a summer apart.

 ���C you think I want to be a �C a freak?��

 Lily��s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away.

 ��I��m not a freak,�� said Lily. ��That��s a horrible thing to say.�� 

��That��s where you��re going,�� said Petunia with relish. ��A special school for freaks. You and 
that Snape boy... weirdos, that��s what you two are. It��s good you��re being separated from normal 
people. It��s for our safety.�� 

Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an air of 
wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice 
was low and fierce. 

��You didn��t think it was such a freak��s school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged 

him to take you.��

 Petunia turned scarlet. ��Beg? I didn��t beg!��

 ��I saw his reply. It was very kind.��

 ��You shouldn��t have read �C�� whispered Petunia, ��that was my private �C how could you �C?��

 Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. 

Petunia gasped. ��That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!�� 

��No �C not sneaking �C�� Now Lily was on the defensive��������. ��Severus saw the envelope, 
and he couldn��t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that��s all! He says there must be 
wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of �C�� 

��Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!�� said Petunia, now as pale as she had 
been flushed. ��Freak!�� she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her parents stood... 

The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it 
clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken 
the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped, outside a

��479ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

compartment in which a group of rowdy��rough, noisy�� boys were talking. Hunched in a corner 
seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane. 
Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then 

looked back out of the window. She had been crying. 
��I don��t want to talk to you,�� she said in a constricted voice. 
��Why not?�� 
��Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.�� 
��So what?�� 
She threw him a look of deep dislike. ��So she��s my sister!�� 
��She��s only a �C�� He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without 

being noticed, did not hear him. 
��But we��re going!�� he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. ��This is it! We��re 

off to Hogwarts!�� 
She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. 
��You��d better be in Slytherin,�� said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little. 
��Slytherin?�� 
One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape 

until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely 
on the two beside the window, saw his father, slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that 
indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked. 

��Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I��d leave, wouldn��t you?�� James asked the boy lounging 

on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile. 
��My whole family have been in Slytherin,�� he said. 
��Blimey,�� said James, ��and I thought you seemed all right!�� 
Sirius grinned. ��Maybe I��ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you��ve got the 

choice?�� 
James lifted an invisible sword. 
��'Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad.�� 
Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. 
��Got a problem with that?��

��480ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No,�� said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. ��If you��d rather be brawny than brainy 

�C��

 ��Where��re you hoping to go, seeing as you��re neither?�� interjected Sirius. 

James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in 

dislike.

 ��Come on, Severus, let��s find another compartment.��

 ��Oooooo...��

 James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed. 

 ��See ya, Snivellus!�� a voice called, as the compartment door slammed...

 And the scene dissolved once more... 

Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt 

faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, ��Evans, Lily!�� 

He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. 
Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had 
touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, ��Gryffindor!�� 

Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it back to Professor 
McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at 
Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make 
room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, 
and firmly turned her back on him. 

The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily and Sirius at 
the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor 
McGonagall called Snape. 

Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. 

��Slytherin!�� cried the Sorting Hat. 

And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the 
Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, 
patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him...

 And the scene changed... 

Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to

catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were. 

A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting. 

 ��... thought we were supposed to be friends?�� Snape was saying, ��Best friends?�� 

��We are, Sev, but I don��t like some of the people you��re hanging round with! I��m sorry, but I 

detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he��s creepy! D��you know 

what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?��

 Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face. 

 ��That was nothing,�� said Snape. ��It was a laugh, that��s all �C��

 ��It was Dark Magic, and if you think that��s funny �C�� 

��What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?�� demanded Snape. His color rose again as 

he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.

 ��What��s Potter got to do with anything?�� said Lily. 

��They sneak out at night. There��s something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep 

going?��

 ��He��s ill,�� said Lily. ��They say he��s ill �C��

 ��Every month at the full moon?�� said Snape. 

��I know your theory,�� said Lily, and she sounded cold. ��Why are you so obsessed with them 

anyway? Why do you care what they��re doing at night?��

 ��I��m just trying to show you they��re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.��

 The intensity of his gaze made her blush. 

��They don��t use Dark Magic, though.�� She dropped her voice. ��And you��re being really 
ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the 
Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever��s down there �C�� 

Snape��s whole face contorted and he spluttered, ��Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the 

hero? He was saving his neck and his friends�� too! You��re not going to �C I won��t let you �C�� 

��Let me? Let me?�� Lily��s bright green eyes were slits. 

Snape backtracked at once. 

��I didn��t mean �C I just don��t want to see you made a fool of ... He fancies you, James Potter 
fancies you!�� The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. ��And he��s not... everyone 
thinks... big Quidditch hero �C�� Snape��s bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and

Lily��s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead. 

��I know James Potter��s an arrogant toerag,�� she said, cutting across Snape. ��I don��t need you to 
tell me that. But Mulciber��s and Avery��s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don��t understand 
how you can be friends with them.�� 

Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures (criticism) on Mulciber and Avery. The 
moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there 
was a new spring in Snape��s step... 

 And the scene dissolved... 

Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against 
the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the 
place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry 
kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into 
the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear 
it again... He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snape��s defense. Distantly he heard 
Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word, ��Mudblood.��

 The scene changed...

 ��I��m sorry.��

 ��I��m not interested.��

 ��I��m sorry!��

 ��Save your breath.��

 It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of 
the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.

 ��I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.��

 ��I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just �C�� 

��Slipped out?�� There was no pity in Lily��s voice. ��It��s too late. I��ve made excuses for you for 
years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little 
Death Eater friends �C you see, you don��t even deny it! You don��t even deny that��s what you��re all 
aiming to be! You can��t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?��

 He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.

 ��I can��t pretend anymore. You��ve chosen your way, I��ve chosen mine.��

��483ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No �C listen, I didn��t mean �C�� 

���C to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I 
be any different?��

 He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back 
through the portrait hole... 

The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform, Harry seemed to fly through 
shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn 
and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. The adult 
Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something 
or for someone... His fear infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, 
and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for �C 

Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air. Harry thought of lightning, but 

Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.

 ��Don��t kill me!��

 ��That was not my intention.�� 

Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the 

branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated 

from below in the light cast by his wand. 

 ��Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?��

 ��No �C no message �C I��m here on my own account!�� 

Snape was wringing his hands. He looked a little mad, with his straggling black hair flying 

around him.

 ��I �C I come with a warning �C no, a request �C please �C�� 

Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air 

around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other.

 ��What request could a Death Eater make of me?��

 ��The �C the prophecy... the prediction... Trelawney...��

 ��Ah, yes,�� said Dumbledore. ��How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?�� 

��Everything �C everything I heard!�� said Snape. ��That is why �C it is for that reason �C he thinks it 

means Lily Evans!��

��484ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��The prophecy did not refer to a woman,�� said Dumbledore. ��It spoke of a boy born at the end 
of July �C�� 

��You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down �C kill them 
all �C�� 

��If she means so much to you,�� said Dumbledore, ��surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? 
Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?��

 ��I have �C I have asked him �C�� 

��You disgust me,�� said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. 
Snape seemed to shrink a little, ��You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? 
They can die, as long as you have what you want?�� 

Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore. ��Hide them all, then,�� he croaked. 
��Keep her �C them �C safe. Please.��

 ��And what will you give me in return, Severus?�� 

��In �C in return?�� Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a 

long moment he said, ��Anything.�� 

The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore��s office, and something was making a 
terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was 
standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like 
a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.

 ��I thought... you were going... to keep her... safe...�� 

��She and James put their faith in the wrong person,�� said Dumbledore. ��Rather like you, 
Severus. Weren��t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?��

 Snape��s breathing was shallow. 

 ��Her boy survives,�� said Dumbledore.

 With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly. 

��Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and color of Lily 

Evans��s eyes, I am sure?��

 ��DON��T!�� bellowed Snape. ��Gone... dead...��

 ��Is this remorse, Severus?��

 ��I wish... I wish I were dead...��

��485ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��And what use would that be to anyone?�� said Dumbledore coldly. ��If you loved Lily Evans, if 
you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.�� 

Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore��s words appeared to take a long 
time to reach him.

 ��What �C what do you mean?��

 ��You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily��s son.��

 ��He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone �C��

 ��The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.�� 

There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own 
breathing. At last he said, ��Very well. Very well. But never �C never tell, Dumbledore! This must 
be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear... especially Potter��s son... I want your word!�� 

��My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?�� Dumbledore sighed, looking 
down into Snape��s ferocious, anguished face. ��If you insist...�� 

The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in front of 
Dumbledore.

 ���C Mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule breaker, delighted to find himself famous, 
attention-seeking and impertinent �C�� 

��You see what you expect to see, Severus,�� said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a 
copy of Transfiguration Today. ��Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and 
reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.�� 

Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, ��Keep an eye on Quirrell, won��t 
you?�� 

A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart 
in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed. 

 ��Well?�� murmured Dumbledore. 

��Karkaroff��s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how 
much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.�� Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore��s 
crooked-nosed profile. ��Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.�� 

��Does he?�� said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from 
the grounds. ��And are you tempted to join him?��

��486ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No,�� said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur��s and Roger��s retreating figures. ��I am not such a 
coward.�� 

��No,�� agreed Dumbledore. ��You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I 
sometimes think we Sort too soon...��

 He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken... 

And now Harry stood in the headmaster��s office yet again. It was nighttime, and Dumbledore 
sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand 
dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand 
at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down 
Dumbledore��s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore��s eyelids fluttered and opened. 

��Why,�� said Snape, without preamble, ��why did you put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely 
you realized that. Why even touch it?�� 

Marvolo Gaunt��s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of 
Gryffindor lay beside it.

 Dumbledore grimaced. ��I... was a fool. Sorely tempted...��

 ��Tempted by what?��

 Dumbledore did not answer. 

��It is a miracle you managed to return here!�� Snape sounded furious. ��That ring carried a curse 
of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for 
the time being �C�� 

Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one 
being shown an interesting curio. 

 ��You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?�� 

Dumbledore��s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. 
Snape hesitated, and then said, ��I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell 
forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.�� 

Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no 
concern to him. ��I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.�� 

��If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, buy you 
more time!�� said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. ��Did you

��487ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

think that breaking the ring would break the curse?�� 

��Something like that... I was delirious, no doubt...�� said Dumbledore. With an effort he 
straightened himself in his chair. ��Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.�� 

Snape looked utterly perplexed. 

Dumbledore smiled. ��I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to 

have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.�� 

Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. 
Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore��s cursed hand, but the 
other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. 

Scowling, Snape said, ��The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely 
punishment for Lucius��s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco��s parents, while they watch him 
fail and pay the price.�� 

��In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,�� said 
Dumbledore. ��Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is 
yourself?��

 There was a short pause. 

 ��That, I think, is the Dark Lord��s plan.�� 

��Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at 
Hogwarts?��

 ��He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.�� 

��And if it does fall into his grasp,�� said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside�԰�, ��I 
have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at Hogwarts?��

 Snape gave a stiff nod. 

��Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened 

teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to 

accept, he likes you �C��

 ���C much less since his father has lost favor.�� 

��All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever 
schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are 
to save him from Lord Voldemort��s wrath.��

��488ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, ��Are you intending to let him 

kill you?��

 ��Certainly not. You must kill me.�� 

There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was 
gnawing a bit of cuttleboneī���. 

��Would you like me to do it now?�� asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. ��Or would you 
like a few moments to compose an epitaphĹ־��;����?�� 

��Oh, not quite yet,�� said Dumbledore, smiling. ��I daresay the moment will present itself in due 
course. Given what has happened tonight,�� he indicated his withered hand, ��we can be sure that it 
will happen within a year.��

 ��If you don��t mind dying,�� said Snape roughly, ��why not let Draco do it?�� 

��That boy��s soul is not yet so damaged,�� said Dumbledore. ��I would not have it ripped apart on 
my account.��

 ��And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?�� 

��You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and 
humiliation,�� said Dumbledore. ��I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is 
coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year��s league. I confess 
I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, 
Greyback is involved �C I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play 
with her food before she eats it.�� 

His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced Harry, as 

though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod. 

 Dumbledore seemed satisfied. ��Thank you, Severus...�� 

The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted 
castle grounds by twilight. 

��What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together?�� Snape asked 
abruptly.

 Dumbledore looked weary. 

��Why? You aren��t trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy will soon have spent 

more time in detention than out.��

��489ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He is his father over again �C�� 

��In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother��s. I spend time with 
Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.��

 ��Information,�� repeated Snape. ��You trust him... you do not trust me.�� 

��It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the 

boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.��

 ��And why may I not have the same information?�� 

��I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much 

time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.��

 ��Which I do on your orders!�� 

��And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the constant danger in which 
you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while 
withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you.�� 

��Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is 
mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord��s mind!�� 

��Voldemort fears that connection,�� said Dumbledore. ��Not so long ago he had one small taste 
of what truly sharing Harry��s mind means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He 
will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.��

 ��I don��t understand.�� 

��Lord Voldemort��s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry��s. 
Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame �C��

 ��Souls? We were talking of minds!��

 ��In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the other.�� 

Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close by the 

Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them.

 ��After you have killed me, Severus �C�� 

��You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!�� snarled Snape, and 
real anger flared in the thin face now. ��You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I 
have changed my mind!�� 

��You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services you owe me, I

��490ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?��

 Snape looked angry, mutinous. 

Dumbledore sighed. ��Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not 
complain that I have no confidence in you...�� 

They were back in Dumbledore��s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat 
quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking. 

��Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could 
he have the strength to do what must be done?��

 ��But what must he do?�� 

��That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a time �C after my 

death �C do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to 

fear for the life of his snake.��

 ��For Nagini?�� Snape looked astonished. 

��Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his 

bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell 

Harry.��

 ��Tell him what?��

 Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. ��Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort 
tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse 
rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort��s soul was blasted apart from the 
whole, and latched (fasten) itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building. Part of 
Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, 
and a connection with Lord Voldemort��s mind that he has never understood. And while that 
fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord 
Voldemort cannot die.�� 

Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they were so far away 

from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears. 

 ��So the boy... the boy must die?�� asked Snape quite calmly.

 ��And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.�� 

Another long silence. Then Snape said, ��I thought... all those years... that we were protecting

��491ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

him for her. For Lily.�� 

��We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try 
his strength,�� said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. ��Meanwhile, the connection between them 
grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth. Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know 
him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly 
mean the end of Voldemort.��

 Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.

 ��You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?��

 ��Don��t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?��

 ��Lately, only those whom I could not save,�� said Snape. He stood up. ��You have used me.��

 ��Meaning?�� 

��I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was 
supposed to be to keep Lily Potter��s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a 
pig for slaughter �C�� 

��But this is touching, Severus,�� said Dumbledore seriously. ��Have you grown to care for the 
boy, after all?��

 ��For him?�� shouted Snape. ��Expecto Patronum!�� 

From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe. She landed on the office floor, bounded once 

across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her 

silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. 

 ��After all this time?��

 ��Always,�� said Snape. 

And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his 

desk. 

��You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry��s departure from his aunt and 
uncle��s,�� said Dumbledore. ��Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so 
well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry��s 
safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the 
chase, be sure to act your part convincingly... I am counting upon you to remain in Lord 
Voldemort��s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the

��492ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Carrows...�� 

Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus��s face 
looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration. 

��You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,�� Snape murmured, ��that they use decoys. 
Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It��s the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have 
suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?��

 ��I understand,�� murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused... 

Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night. He was 
accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really 
George... A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin��s 
back.

 ��Sectumsempra!�� shouted Snape. 

 But the spell, intended for the Death Eater��s wand hand, missed and hit George instead �C 

And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius��s old bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his 
hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words, 

could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind��s going, 
personally! 
Lots of love, 
Lily 

Snape took the page bearing Lily��s signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then 
he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily 
laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of 
drawers... 

And now Snape stood again in the headmaster��s study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into 

his portrait.

 ��Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood �C��

 ��Do not use that word!��

 ���C the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her!�� 

��Good. Very good!�� cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster��s chair. ��Now, 

Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor �C and he

��493ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry��s mind and see you acting for him 
�C�� 

��I know,�� said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side. It 
swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor. 

��And you still aren��t going to tell me why it��s so important to give Potter the sword?�� said 
Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes. 

��No, I don��t think so,�� said Dumbledore��s portrait. ��He will know what to do with it. And 
Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley��s 
mishap �C��

 Snape turned at the door. 

 ��Don��t worry, Dumbledore,�� he said coolly. ��I have a plan...�� 

And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the 
carpeted floor in exactly the same room Snape might just have closed the door.

Chapter Thirty-Four 
The Forest Again 


Finally, the truth. Lying with his face 
the dusty carpet of the office where he had 
he was learning the secrets of victory, Harry 
last that he was not supposed to survive. His 
walk calmly into Death��s welcoming arms. 
way, he was to dispose of Voldemort��s 
links to life, so that when at last he flung

job was to 
Along the 
remaining 
himself 

across Voldemort��s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and 
the job that ought to have been done in Godric��s Hollow would be finished. Neither would live, 
neither could survive. 

He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of death, it 
pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats 
were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for 
the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest? 

Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding inside him. 
Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he 
had never really thought of the thing itself. His will to live had always been so much stronger than 
his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was 
over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself, dying. 

If he could only have died on that summer��s night when he had left number four, Privet Drive, 
for the last time, when the noble phoenix feather wand had saved him! If he could only have died 
like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched 
himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved ... He envied even his parents�� deaths now. 
This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. He felt 
his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him; 
the portraits on the walls were all empty. 

Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own

living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and 
nerve and pounding heart? It would all be gone ... or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath 
came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes. 

Dumbledore��s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan, Harry had 
simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had never questioned his own 
assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his life span had always been 
determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of 
destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only 
Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the 
dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not 
be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort. 

And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep going to the 
end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn��t he? 
Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that 
he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead 
in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind��s eye, and for a moment he could hardly 
breathe. Death was impatient ... 

But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed. The snake survived. One Horcrux 
remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean 
an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it ... Ron and Hermione would know what 
needed to be done, of course ... That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in 
two others ... so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on ... 

Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the 
incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. I must die. It must end. 

Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as though he had 
parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes and no explanations, he was determined 
of that. This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop 
him would waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his 
seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed.

He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had 
little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime��s beats before the end. He did not 
look back as he closed the office door. 

The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died. The 
portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its 
remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were 
crammed. 

Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, at last 
walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to 
be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he 
reached the front doors easily. 

Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in 
from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach, Colin Creevey, 
though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was 
tiny in death. 

��You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,�� said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin 
over his shoulder in a fireman��s lift and carried him into the Great Hall. 

Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his 
hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off on the steps again into the darkness to recover 
more bodies. 

Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving around, 
trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the 
people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt 
he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would 
he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this. 

He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the morning, and the 
deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath, waiting to see 
whether he could do what he must.

 Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body.

 ��Neville.��

��Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!�� 

Harry had pulled off the Cloak. The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born out of a desire 
to make absolutely sure.

 ��Where are you going, alone?�� Neville asked suspiciously.

 ��It��s all part of the plan,�� said Harry. ��There��s someting I��ve got to do. Listen - Neville -�� 

��Harry!�� Neville looked suddenly scared. ��Harry, you��re not thinking of handing yourself 
over?�� 

��No,�� Harry lied easily. ��'Course not ... this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a 
while. You know Voldemort��s snake. Neville? He��s got a huge snake ... Calls it Nagini ...��

 ��I��ve heard, yeah ... What about it?��

 ��It��s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they -�� 

The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible to keep 
talking. But he pulled himself together again. This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep 
a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that 
three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take Harry��s place. There would 
still be three in the secret.

 ��Just in case they��re - busy - and you get the chance -��

 ��Kill the snake?��

 ��Kill the snake,�� Harry repeated.

 ��All right, Harry. You��re okay, are you?��

 ��I��m fine. Thanks, Neville.��

 But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on. 

 ��We��re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?��

 ��Yeah, I -�� 

The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could not go on. Neville did 
not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to 
look for more bodies. 

Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone else was moving not far 
away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he 
realized it was Ginny.

��498ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother.

 ��It��s all right,�� Ginny was saying. ��It��s ok. We��re going to get you inside.��

 ��But I want to go home,�� whispered the girl. ��I don��t want to fight anymore!��

 ��I know,�� said Ginny, and her voice broke. ��It��s going to be all right.�� 

Ripples of cold undulated (cause to move in waves) over Harry��s skin. He wanted to shout out 
to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was 
going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home... 

But he was home. Hogwards was the first and best home he had known. He and Voldemort and 
Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here. 

Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With a huge effort Harry 
forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed, and wondered whether she 
had sensed someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back. 

Hagrid��s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang scrabbling at 
the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper 
kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting 
slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert ... 

 He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped. 

A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, and he was not 
sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had not strength left for a Patronus. He could no 
longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the 
smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious. To think that people had years and 
years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same 
time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was 
ended, the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. 

The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he 
pulled it out. 

I open at the close. 

Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as slowly as 
possible, it seemed to have sped up, and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have 
bypassed thought. This was the close. This was the moment.

��499ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, ��I am about to die.�� 

The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco��s wand beneath the 
Cloak, and murmured, ��Lumos.�� 

The black stone with is jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the 
Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. 
The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible. 

And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about bringing them 

back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them. They were fetching him.

 He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times. 

He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail 
bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the 
forest. He opened his eyes and looked around. 

They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most closely the 
Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. 
Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him. And on 
each face, there was the same loving smile. 

James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, 
and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley��s. 

Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life. He loped 
(move with a fast relaxed stride) with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face. 

Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker. He looked 
happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings. 

Lily��s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew closer to him, and her 
green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at 
him enough. 

 ��You��ve been so brave.��

 He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to stand and look 
at her forever, and that would be enough. 

 ��You are nearly there,�� said James. ��Very close. We are so proud of you.��

 ��Does it hurt?��

��500ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The childish question had fallen from Harry��s lips before he could stop it.

 ��Dying? Not at all,�� said Sirius. ��Quicker and easier than falling asleep.��

 ��And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,�� said Lupin.

 ��I didn��t want you to die,�� Harry said. These words came without his volition. ��Any of you. I��m 
sorry -�� 

He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him. ��-right after you��d had your 
son ... Remus, I��m sorry.�� 

��I am sorry too,�� said Lupin. ��Sorry I will never know him ... but he will know why I died and I 
hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.�� 

A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at Harry��s 
brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision. 

 ��You��ll stay with me?��

 ��Until the very end,�� said James.

 ��They won��t be able to see you?�� asked Harry.

 ��We are part of you,�� said Sirius. ��Invisible to anyone else.��

 Harry looked at his mother.

 ��Stay close to me,�� he said quietly. 

And he set off. The dementors�� chill did not overcome him; he passed through it with his 
companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they marched through the old 
trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. 
Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the 
forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him. Beside him, 
making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his 
courage, and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other. 

His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without conscious 
instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who 
walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the 
castle, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled 
and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort ... 

A thud and a whisper. Some other living creature had stirred close by. Harry stopped under the

��501ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too. 

��Someone there,�� came a rough whisper close at hand. ��He��s got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it 
be -?�� 

Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree, their wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and 
Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and 
Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything.

 ��Definitely heard something,�� said Yaxley. ��Animal, d��you reckon?�� 

��That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,�� said Dolohov, glancing over his 
shoulder.

 Yaxley looked down at his watch. 

 ��Time��s nearly up. Porter��s had his hour. He��s not coming.��

 ��Better go back,�� said Yaxley. ��Find out what the plan is now.�� 

He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, knowing that 
they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled 
at him, and his father nodded encouragement. 

They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov 
stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had 
once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarms of descendants he had 
spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause. 

A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a crowd of 
completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and hooded; others 
showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the 
scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; 
the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked 
defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. 

Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his white hands 
folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently 
in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting 
in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini 
floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.

��502ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up. 

 ��No sign of him, my Lord,�� said Dolohov. 

Voldemort��s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly he 
drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers. 

 ��My Lord -�� 

Bellatrix had spoken. She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little bloody but 
otherwise unharmed. 

Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but eyed him in 
worshipful fascination. 

��I thought he would come,�� said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on the leaping 
flames. ��I expected him to come.�� 

Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing itself against 
his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. His hands were 
sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He 
did not want to be tempted to fight. 

 ��I was, it seems ... mistaken,�� said Voldemort.

 ��You weren��t.�� 

Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster. He did not want to sound 
afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers, and out of the corner of his 
eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that 
moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them. 

The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose 
together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood, 
but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the 
fire between them.

 Then a voice yelled, ��HARRY! NO!�� 

He turned. Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His massive body shook the 
branches overhead as he struggled, desperate.

 ��NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT��RE YEH - ?��

 ��QUIET!�� shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand, Hagrid was silenced.

��503ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, her breast 
heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the 
glittering cage behind Voldemort��s head.

 Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no attempt to draw it. He knew that the 
snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses 
would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted 
his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless 
smile curled the lipless mouth. 

��Harry Potter,�� he said very softly. His voice might have been part of the spitting fire. ��The 
Boy Who Lived.�� 

None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting, Everything was waiting. Hagrid was 
struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing 
look, and the feel of her lips on his... 

Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, 
wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it 
to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear...

 He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone.

Chapter Thirty-Five 
King's Cross 


He lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was 


perfectly 
alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He 

was not 
perfectly sure that he was there himself. 
A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to 

him that he 
must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he 

was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing 
against which he lay existed too. 

Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. 
Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. 
He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered 
that he had eyes. 

He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His 
surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into 
surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply 
there, a flat, blank something on which to be. 

He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses 
anymore.

 Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him, the small soft 
thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly 
indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, 
shameful.

 For the first time, he wished he were clothed. 

Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. He took 
them and pulled them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had 
appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. 

He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he 
looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight.

��505ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering 
noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. 

Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his 
eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear 
domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for �C 

He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, 
naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed��Ƥ 
-looking, and it lay 
shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for 
breath. 

He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach 
it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near 
enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to 
comfort it, but it repulsed him.

 ��You cannot help.�� 

He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly���õ� and upright, 
wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. 

��Harry.�� He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. 
��You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.�� 

Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay 
whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance 
away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into 
the other, staring at his old headmaster��s face. Dumbledore��s long silver hair and beard, the 
piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose, everything was as he had 
remembered it. And yet ... 

 ��But you��re dead,�� said Harry.

 ��Oh yes,�� said Dumbledore matter-of-factly.

 ��Then ... I��m dead too?�� 

��Ah,�� said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. ��That is the question, isn��t it? On the 
whole, dear boy, I think not.��

 They looked at each other, the old man still beaming.

��506ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Not?�� repeated Harry.

 ��Not,�� said Dumbledore. 

��But...�� Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be 
there. ��But I should have died �C I didn��t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!��

 ��And that,�� said Dumbledore, ��will, I think, have made all the difference.�� 

Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light; like fire, Harry had never seen the 

man so utterly, so palpably content.

 ��Explain,�� said Harry.

 ��But you already know,�� said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together.

 ��I let him kill me,�� said Harry. ��Didn��t I?��

 ��You did,�� said Dumbledore, nodding. ��Go on!��

 ��So the part of his soul that was in me ...�� 

Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of 

encouragement on his face.

 ��... has it gone?�� 

��Oh yes!�� said Dumbledore. ��Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your 
own, Harry.�� 

��But then ...�� Harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled 
under the chair. ��What is that, Professor?��

 ��Something that is beyond either of our help,�� said Dumbledore. 

��But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,�� Harry started again, ��and nobody died for me this 
time �C how can I be alive?�� 

��I think you know,�� said Dumbledore. ��Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, 
in his greed and his cruelty.�� 

Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which 
they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, 
he and Dumbledore and the stunted�谭 
...�ķ���creatures under the chair were the only beings 
there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

 ��He took my blood,�� said Harry. 

��Precisely!�� said Dumbledore. ��He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your

��507ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

blood in his veins, Harry, Lily��s protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he 
lives!�� 

��I live ... while he lives? But I thought ... I thought it was the other way around! I thought we 
both had to die? Or is it the same thing?�� 

He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and 
glanced back at it yet again.

 ��Are you sure we can��t do anything?��

 ��There is no help possible.��

 ��Then explain ... more,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. 

��You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered 
his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the 
murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was 
even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, 
the would-be victim who had survived. 

��And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not 
value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children��s tales, of love, loyalty, and 
innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power 
beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. 

��He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the 
enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrafice alive, 
and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort��s one last hope for 
himself.��

 Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.

 ��And you knew this? You knew �C all along?�� 

��I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,�� said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in 
silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and 
tremble. 

��There��s more,�� said Harry. ��There��s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he 
borrowed?��

 ��As to that, I cannot be sure.��

��508ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Have a guess, then,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. 

��What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together 
into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is 
unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted or explained it to 
Voldemort. 

��Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when 
he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to 
strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother��s sacrafice into himself. If he could only have 
understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to 
touch your blood... But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, 
and might never have murdered at all. 

��Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more 
securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a 
wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The 
cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had 
never expected. 

��He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the 
possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, 
your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, 
something that echoed the relationship between their masters. 

��I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort��s wand that 
night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him 
when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated 
some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius��s wand had 
ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of 
Voldemort��s own deadly skill, What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy��s stand?��

 ��But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?�� asked Harry. 

��My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-
advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. 
Otherwise it was a wand like any other ... though a good one, I am sure,�� Dumbledore finished

kindly. 

Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things 
like time here.

 ��He killed me with your wand.�� 

��He failed to kill you with my wand,�� Dumbledore corrected Harry. ��I think we can agree that 
you are not dead �C though, of course,�� he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, ��I do not 
minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.�� 

��I feel great at the moment, though,�� said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. 
��Where are we, exactly?�� 

��Well, I was going to ask you that,�� said Dumbledore, looking around. ��Where would you say 
that we are?�� 

Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an 
answer ready to give. 

��It looks,�� he said slowly, ��like King��s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there 
are no trains as far as I can see.��

 ��King��s Cross station!�� Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. ��Good gracious, really?��

 ��Well, where do you think we are?�� asked Harry, a little defensively.

 ��My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.�� 

Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then 
remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location. 

��The Deathly Hallows,�� he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from 
Dumbledore��s face. 

 ��Ah, yes,�� he said. He even looked a little worried. 

 ��Well?�� 

For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. 

He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. 

��Can you forgive me?�� he said. ��Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? 
Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my 
mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better 
man.��

��510ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��What are you talking about?�� asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore��s tone, by the sudden tears 

in his eyes.

 ��The Hallows, the Hallows,�� murmured Dumbledore. ��A desperate man��s dream!��

 ��But they��re real!�� 

��Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,�� said Dumbledore. ��And I was such a fool. But you 

know, don��t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.��

 ��What do I know?�� 

Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue 

eyes.

 ��Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?�� 

��Of course you were,�� said Harry. ��Of course �C how can you ask that? You never killed if you 
could avoid it!�� 

��True, true,�� said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. ��Yet I too sought a 
way to conquer death, Harry.�� 

��Not the way he did,�� said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, 
beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. ��Hallows, not 
Horcruxes.��

 ��Hallows,�� murmured Dumbledore, ��not Horcruxes. Precisely.��

 There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. 

 ��Grindelwald was looking for them too?�� he asked.

 Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. 

��It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,�� he said quietly. ��Two clever, arrogant boys 
with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric��s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, 
because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had 
died.��

 ��So it��s true?�� asked Harry. ��All of it? The Peverell brothers �C�� 

��-were the three brothers of the tale?�� said Dumbledore, nodding. ��Oh yes, I think so. Whether 
they met Death on a lonely road ... I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply 
gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them 
being Death��s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such

��511ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

creations. 

��The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to 
daughter, right down to Ignotus��s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the 
village of Godric��s Hollow.��

 Dumbledore smiled at Harry.

 ��Me?�� 

��You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your 
parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his 
undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to 
examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could 
not help taking a closer look... It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, 
perfect in every respect ... and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!��

 His tone was unbearably bitter. 

��The Cloak wouldn��t have helped them survive, though,�� Harry said quickly. ��Voldemort knew 
where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn��t have made them curse-proof.��

 ��True,�� sighed Dumbledore. ��True.��

 Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him.

 ��So you��d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?��

 ��Oh yes,�� said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry��s eyes. ��You 

know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.��

 ��But I don��t despise you �C�� 

��Then you should,�� said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. ��You know the secret of my 
sister��s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father 
sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own 
life to care for Ariana.

 ��I resented it, Harry.�� 

Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry��s head, into the 
distance.

 ��I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. 

��Do not misunderstand me,�� he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again.

��512ҳ�� 
542ҳ

��I loved them, I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more 
selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. 

��So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a 
wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! 
And then of course, he came...��

 Dumbledore looked directly into Harry��s eyes again. 

��Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles 
forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of 
the revolution.

 ��Oh, I had a few scruples�˼�. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for 
the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I 
know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If 
the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. 

��And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they 
fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The 
Resurrection Stone �C to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, 
I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. 

��And the Cloak ... somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could 
conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can 
be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might 
be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for 
the legend said that the man who had united all three objects would then be truly master of death, 
which we took to mean ��invincible.�� 

��Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel 
dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. 

��And then ... you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, 
and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not 
want to hear that I could not set forth and seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow 
(under one��s care, ����). 

��The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in

��513ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana ... after all my mother��s 
care and caution ... lay dead upon the floor.�� 

Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to 
find that he could touch him, He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained 
control. 

��Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for 
seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams 
in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and 
learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. 

��Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense 
power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. 
Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.��

 ��But you��d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scimgeour!�� burst out Harry. 

��Would I?�� asked Dumbledore heavily. ��I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, 
that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those 
who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have 
leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle����, ����because they must, and find to their 
own surprise that they wear it well.

 ��I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher �C��

 ��You were the best -�� 

��-you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, 
Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than 
I feared him. 

��Oh, not death,�� said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry��s questioning look. ��Not what he could 
do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. 
It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually 
cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly, you would be right, Harry. I 
dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not 
merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her 
life.

��514ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it 
would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, 
and I had to do what I could.

 ��Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.�� 

Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana 
dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last 
he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of Erised, and why 
Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. 

They sat in silence for a long time, and the whipmerings of the creature behind them barely 
disturbed Harry anymore. 

At last he said, ��Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, 
pretended he had never had it.��

 Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. 

��They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that is true. 
I would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to 
Voldemort was his attempt to make amends ... to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow ...�� 

��... or maybe from breaking into your tomb?�� suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his 
eyes.

 After another short pause Harry said, ��You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.��

 Dumbledore nodded. 

��When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts -the 
Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons -I 
lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a 
curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and 
my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry, I was... 

��I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite 

the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.��

 ��Why?�� said Harry. ��It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What��s wrong with that?��

 ��Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest 

of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not boast of it, and not to kill

��515ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

with it. I was permitted to tame and use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. 

��But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiousity, and so it could never have worked for me as it 
works for you, its true owners. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who 
are at peace, rather than enable my self-sacrafice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the 
Hallows.�� 

Dumbledore patted Harry��s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not 

help himself. How could he remain angry with Dumbledore now?

 ��Why did you have to make it so difficult?��

 Dumbledore��s smile was tremulous. 

��I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head 
might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those 
tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If 
you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, 
because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and 
understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.��

 ��And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?�� 

��I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a 
Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry. I doubt that he would have been interested 
in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom 
would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.��

 ��But you expected him to go after the wand?�� 

��I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort��s in the graveyard of 
Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had 
kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that 
explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead 
of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you 
possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any 
other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He 
believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor 
Severus ...��

��516ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn��t 

you?��

 ��I admit that was my intention,�� said Dumbledore, ��but it did not work as I intended, did it?��

 ��No,�� said Harry. ��That bit didn��t work out.�� 

The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking 

for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in 

the long minutes, like softly falling snow. 

 ��I��ve got to go back, haven��t I?��

 ��That is up to you.��

 ��I��ve got a choice?�� 

��Oh yes,�� Dumbledore smiled at him. ��We are in King��s Cross you say? I think that if you 

decided not to go back, you would be able to ... let��s say ... board a train.��

 ��And where would it take me?��

 ��On,�� said Dumbledore simply.

 Silence again.

 ��Voldemort��s got the Elder Wand.��

 ��True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.��

 ��But you want me to go back?�� 

��I think,�� said Dumbledore, ��that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be 
finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from 
returning here than he does.�� 

Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath 
the distant chair. 

��Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love. By 
returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems 
to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.�� 

Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the 
forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading 
back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they 
looked for a long moment into each other��s faces.

��517ҳ�� 
542ҳ

��Tell me one last thing,�� said Harry, ��Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?�� 

Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry��s ears even though 
the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. 

��Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it is not 
real?��

Chapter Thirty-Six 
The Flaw in the Plan 



He was lying facedown on the ground again. 


The smell of the 
forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold 

hard ground 
beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses 

which have been 
knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his 

temple. Every 
inch of him ached, and the place where Killing 

Curse had hit him 
felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did 

not stir, but he 
remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an akward angle and his mouth 
gaping. 

He had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried 

footsteps, whispers, and solicitous (anxious, concerned) murmurs filled the air.

 "My Lord... my Lord...�� 

It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but 
allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed 
beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight 
cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, 
stuffed out of sight. 

"My Lord...��

 "That will do���ˣ�����," said Voldemort's voice. 

More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate to see what 
was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a milimeter. 

Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from 
him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside 
Voldemort. 

Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters had been 
huddled around Voldemort, who seem to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when 
he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both 
of them had briefly fallen unconcious and both of them had now returned...

��519ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"My Lord, let me -" 

"I do not require assitance," said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry 
pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. "The boy ... Is he dead?" 

There was a complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their 
concentraded gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or 
an eyelid might twitch. 

"You," said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shrick of pain. "Examine him. Tell 
me whether he is dead." 

Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart 
thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though 
it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not 
gone to plan ... 

Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, and felt his heart. He could 

hear the woman's fast breathing, her pounding of life against his ribs. 

"Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?" 

The whisper was barely audible, her lips were an inch from his scar, her head bent so low that 

her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers. 

"Yes," he breathed back. 

He felt the hand on his chest contract, her nails pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had 

sat up. 

 "He is dead!" Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. 

And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his 

eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. 

Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would 
be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no 
longer cared whether Voldemort won. 

"You see?" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. "Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no 
man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!" 

Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied (sully tarnish; 
stain, disgrace) upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove

��520ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet 
the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses 
flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, 
and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of 
laughter. 

"Now," said Voldemort, "we go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. 
Who shall drag the body? No - Wait -" 

There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the ground 
trembling beneath him. 

"You carry him," Voldemort said. "He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick 
up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable -" 

Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous 
hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms 
trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid 
cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate��ʾ 
,���� 
to 
Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. 

"Move," said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-
growing trees, back through the forest. 

Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent (motionless, inactive), his mouth 
lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, 
and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck 
of Harry Potter... 

The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and 
falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the 
jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open 
ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed 
eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. 

 "BANE!" 

Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open. "Happy now, are yeh, that yeh 
didn't fight, yeh cowardly bunch o' nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter's - d-dead ...?" 

��521ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs 
were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters 
called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening 
of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. 

 "Stop." 

Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, because he 
lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping 
breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. 

The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father's 
stag kept guardian in his heart. 

Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a 
moment later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground, crashing upon 
Harry's eardrums. 

"Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down 
your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. 

"The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and 
the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, 
woman or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle 
now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and 
sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build togheter." 

There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry 
did not dare open his eyes again. 

"Come," said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. 
Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front them, wearing the great 
snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility 
of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who 
marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness ... 

 "Harry," sobbed Hagrid. "Oh, Harry ... Harry ...�� 

Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his 
ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

of life from those within. 

 "Stop." 

The Death Eaters came to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the opne front 
doors of the school. He could see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light 
streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had 
tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms.

 "NO!" 

The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor 
McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another women laughing nearby, and knew that 
Bellatrix gloried��ϲ in McGonagall's despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the 
open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to 
face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for themselves. He saw Voldemort 
standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head with a single white finger. He closed his 
eyes again.

 "No!" 

"No!"

 "Harry! HARRY!" 

Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry wanted nothing 
more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd 
of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eathers, until - 

"SILENCE!" cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was 

forced upn them all. "It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!"

 Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. 

"You see?" said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the 
place where he lay. "Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, 
ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!" 

"He beat you!" yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting 
and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.

 "He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds," said Voldemort, and there was a 
relish in his voice for the lie. "killed while trying to save himself - " 

��523ҳ��

But Voldemort broke off, Harry heard a scuffle (quarrel, minor fight) and a shout, then another 
bang, a flash of light, and grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had 
broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort. Harry saw the figure hit the ground. 
Disarmed. Voldemort throwing the challenger's wand aside and laughing. 

"And who is this?" he said in his soft snake's hiss. "Who has volunteered to demonstrate what 

happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?" 

 Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. 

"It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much 

trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?" 

"Ah, yes, I remember," said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to 
his feet, unarmed and unproctected, standing in the no-man's-land��յش� 
between the survivors 
and the Death Eaters. "But you are a pureblood, aren't you, my brave boy?" Voldemort asked 
Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled in fists. 

 "So what if I am?" said Neville loudly. 

"You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable 
Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom." 

"I'll join you when hell freezes over," said Neville. "Dumbledore's Army!" he shouted, and 
there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed 
unable to hold. 

"Very well," said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in 
the most powerful curse. "If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On 
your head," he said quietly, "be it." 

Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of 
one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through 
the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end 
and it dangled, emtpy and ragged, the Sorting Hat. 

"There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School," said Voldemort. "There will be no more 
Houses. The emblem, shield and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slythering, will suffice 
everyone. Won't they, Neville Longbottom?" 

He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto Neville's

��524ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

head, so that it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in 
front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of 
Hogwarts at bay. 

"Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue 
to oppose me," said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst 
into flames. 

Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry 

could not bear it, He must act - 

 And then many things happened at the same moment. 

They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of 
people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war 
cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castel and yelled, 
"HAGGER!" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's giants. They ran at Grawp like bull 
elephants making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were 
suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled 
the Invisibilty Cloak from inside his robes, swunt it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville 
moved too. 

In one swift, fluid motin, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming hat 
fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle - 

The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the 
sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampending centaurs, and yet, it seemd to draw every eye. 
With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head, which spun high into the air, 
gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort's mouth was open in a scream 
of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's body thudded to the ground at his feet. 

Hidden beneath the Invisibilty Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and 
Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand. Then, over the screams and roars and the 
thunderous stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid's yell came loudets of all.

 "HARRY!" Hagrid shouted. "HARRY - WHERE'S HARRY?" 

Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing 
the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearar thundered the reinforcements that had come from

��525ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatues soaring around the heads of Voldemort's 
giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and 
pummeled them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike were being 
forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, 
and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the 
retreating crowd. 

Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffetted into the entrance hall. He was 
searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed 
into the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and 
right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and 
Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing 
inside it. 

And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw 
Charlie Weasly overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emeral pyjamas. They 
seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts 
student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. 
The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as 
behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges. 

The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving 
knives�����õĲ͵� 
and cleaver (heavy butcher knife), and at their head, the locker of Regulus 
Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din, 
"Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of 
brave Regulus! Fight!" 

They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive 
with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of 
numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else 
simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde. 

 But it was not over yet, Harry sped between duelers, past struggling prisoners, and into he Great 
Hall.

��526ҳ��

Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting (smite -hit, strike) 
all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the 
Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. 

Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a 
scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone 
wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir 
Greyback. Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and 
Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. 

Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, Kingsley all at once, and there was a cold 
hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him. 

Bellatrix was still fighing too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled 
three at once, Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to 
them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed 
death by an inch. 

He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few 

steps he was knocked sideways.

 "NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!" 

Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms, Bellatrix spun on the spot, 

roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger. 

"OUT OF MY WAY!" shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a simple swipe of her 
wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed 
and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from 
both wands, the floor around the withces' feet became hot and cracked; both woman were fighting 
to kill. 

"No!" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. "Get back! 
Get back! She is mine!" 

Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three 
opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack 
and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. 

"What will happen to your children when I've killed you?" taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her

��527ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

master, capering (jump about) as Molly's curses danced around her. "When Mummy's gone the 
same way as Freddie?" 
"You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!" screamed Mrs. Weasley. 
Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled 
backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. 
Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, 
directly over her heart. 

Bellatrix's gloating smile froze, her eyes seemd to bulge. For the tiniest space of time she knew 
what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemord 
screamed. 

Harry felt as though he turned into slow motin, he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn 
blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, 
best leutenant exploded with the force of a bomb, Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at 
Molly Weasley. 

"Protego!" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and 
Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. 
The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of "Harry!" "HE'S ALIVE!" were 
stifled at once. 
The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked 
at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other. 
"I don't want anyone else to try to help," Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice 

carried like a trumpet call. "It's got to be like this. It's got to be me."

 Voldemort hissed. 

"Potter doesn't mean that," he said, his red eyes wide. "This isn't how he works, is it? Who are 
you going to use as a shield today, Potter?" 

"Nobody," said Harry simply. "There are no more Horcruxes. It's just you and me. Neither can 
live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good." 

"One of us?" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake 
that was about to strike. "You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, 
and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings��Ļ�����?"

��528ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?" asked Harry. They were still moving 
sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and 
for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. "Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? 
Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?" 

"Accidents!" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was 
frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. 
"Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men 
and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!" 

"You won't be killing anyone else tonight," said Harry as they circled, and stared into each 
other's eyes, green into red. "You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I 
was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people -" 

 "But you did not!" 

"-I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. 
Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. 
You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?"

 "You dare -" 

"Yes, I dare," said Harry. "I know things you don't know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important 
things that you don't. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?" 

Voldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily 
mesmerized at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final 
secret.

 "Is it love again?" said Voldemort, his snake's face jeering. "Dumbledore favorite solution, love, 
which he claimed conqered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and 
breaking like and old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Modblood 
mother like a cockroack, Potter -and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time 
and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?" 

"Just one thing," said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart 
by nothing but the last secret. 

"If it is not love that will save you this time," said Voldemort, "you must believe that you have 
magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?"

��529ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I believe both," said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snake-like face, though it was 
instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his 
screams; humorles and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. 

"You think you know more magic than I do?" he said. "Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has 
performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?" 

"Oh he dreamed of it," said Harry, "but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what 
you've done." 

"You mean he was weak!" screamed Voldemort. "Too weak to dare, too weak to take what 
might have been his, what will be mine!"

 "No, he was cleverer than you," said Harry, "a better wizard, a better man."

 "I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!"

 "You thought you did," said Harry, "but you were wrong." 

For the frist time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew 

breath as one. 

"Dumbledore is dead!" Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though they would cause him 
undurable pain. "His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, 
Potter, and he will not return!" 

"Yes, Dumbledore is dead," said Harry calmly, "but you didn't have him killed. He chose his 
own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you 
thought was your servant." 

"What childish dream is this?" said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did 
not waver from Harry's. 

"Severus Snape wasn't yours," said Harry. "Snape was Dumbledore's. Dumbledore's from the 
moment you starting hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you 
can't understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?" 

Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each 
other apart. 

"Snape's Patronus was a doe," said Harry, "the same as my mother's, because he loved her for 
nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized," he said as 
he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, "he asked you to spare her life, didn't he?" 

��530ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"He desired her, that was all," sneered Voldemort, "but when she had gone, he agreed that there 
were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him -" 

"Of course he told you that," said Harry, "but he was Dumbledore's spy from the moment you 
threatened her, and he's been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying 
when Snape finished him!" 

"It matters not!" shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but 
now let out a cackle of mad laughter. "It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore's, or 
what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape's 
supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! 

"Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be 
the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy -I reached the wand before 
you could get your hands on it. I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape 
three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! 
Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!"

 "Yeah, it did." said Harry. "You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise you think what 

you've done ... Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle ..." 

 "What is this?" 

Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had socked 
Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes 
whiten. 

"It's your one last chance," said Harry, "it's all you've got left ... I've seen what you'll be 
otherwise ... Be a man... try... Try for some remorse ..." 

 ��You dare -?�� said Voldemort again. 

��Yes, I dare,�� said Harry, ��because Dumbledore��s last plan hasn��t backfired on me at all. It��s 
backfired on you, Riddle.�� 

Voldemort��s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco��s very tightly. 
The moment, he knew, was seconds away. 

��That wand still isn��t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. 
Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.��

 ��He killed -��

��531ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Aren��t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore��s death was planned 
between them! Dumbledore instended to die, undefeated, the wand��s last true master! If all had 
gone as planned, the wand��s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from 
him!�� 

��But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!�� Voldemort��s voice shook with 
malicious pleasure. ��I stole the wand from its last master��s tomb! I removed it against the last 
master��s wishes! Its power is mine!�� 

��You still don��t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn��t enough! Holding it, using it, 
doesn��t make it really yours. Didn��t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard ... The 
Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a 
hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing 
exactly what he had done, or that the world��s most dangerous wand had given him its 
allegiance ...�� 

Voldemort��s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building 

inside the wand pointed at his face.

 ��The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.��

 Blank shock showed in Voldemort��s face for a moment, but then it was gone. 

��But what does it matter?�� he said softly. ��Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference 
to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand. We duel on skill alone ... and after I have 
killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy ...�� 

��But you��re too late,�� said Harry. ��You��ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered 
Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him.��

 Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. 

��So it all comes down to this, doesn��t it?�� whispered Harry. ��Does the wand in your hand know 

its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does ... I am the true master of the Elder Wand.�� 

A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun 
appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so 
that Voldemort��s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled 
his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco��s wand:

 ��Avada Kedavra!��

��532ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Expelliarmus!�� 

The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead 
center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw 
Voldemort��s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, 
spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the 
master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the 
unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms 
splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane 
finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and 
unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two 
wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy��s shell. 

One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended, and then the tumult broke 
around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce 
new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron 
and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts 
that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and 
Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word 
that anyone was shouting, not tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some 
part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the 
reason it was over at last... 

The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was 
an indispensible part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and 
celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their 
guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to 
occur to no one. 

He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear 
the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and 
down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being 
captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley

Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. 

They moved Voldemort��s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away form the bodies of 
Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had 
replaced the House tables, but now nobody was sitting according to House anymore. All were 
jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze 
lay recovering in the corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were 
throwing food into his laughing mouth. 

After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.

 ��I��d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,�� she said. 

 ��I��d love some,�� he replied.

 ��I��ll distract them all,�� she said. ��Use your cloak.�� 

And before he could say a word, she had cried, ��Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!�� and 
pointed out the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over 
himself, and got to his feet. 

Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; 
she was sitting with her head on her mother��s shoulder. There would be time to talk later, hours 
and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside 
his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he 
walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they 
were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked, he 
saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most.

 ��It��s me,�� he muttered, crouching down between them. ��Will you come with me?�� 

They stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks 
were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains 
occurred every few steps as their climbed. 

Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a 
victory song of his own composition: 

We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter��s the one, 

And Voldy��s gone moldy, so now let��s have fun! 

��Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn��t it?�� said Ron, pushing

open a door to let Harry and Hermione through. 

Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and 
the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. 
Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an 
explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the 
truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the 
forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement, when at last they 
arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their 
destination. 

Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster��s study had been 
knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it 
would be able to distinguish passwords anymore.

 ��Can we go up?�� he asked the gargoyle.

 ��Feel free,�� groaned the statue. 

They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an 
escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. 

He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an 
earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth 
of Voldemort. 

But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts 
were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they 
reached through their frames to grip each other��s hands; they danced up and down on their chairs 
in which they have been painted, Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was 
waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Niggelus called, in his high, reedy voice, ��And let it be noted 
that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!�� 

But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the 
headmaster��s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long 
silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry with the same balm 
as phoenix song. 

At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping

��535ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, 
and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one 
last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. 

��The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,�� he began, ��I dropped it in the forest. I don��t know 
exactly where, but I��m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?�� 

��My dear boy, I do,�� said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. 
��A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone 
know else know where it fell?��

 ��No one,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.

 ��I��m going to keep Ignotus��s present, though,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.

 ��But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!��

 ��And then there��s this.�� 

Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even 
in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. 

 ��I don��t want it.�� said Harry.

 ��What?�� said Ron loudly. ��Are you mental?��

 ��I know it��s powerful,�� said Harry wearily. ��But I was happier with mine. So ...�� 

He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly still 
just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be 
repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would. 

He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster��s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder 
Wand, and said, ��Reparo.�� 

As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He 
picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and 
hand were rejoicing at their reunion. 

��I��m putting the Elder Wand,�� he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous 
affection and admiration, ��back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like 
Ignotus, its power will be broken, won��t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. 
That��ll be the end of it.��

 Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other.

��536ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Are you sure?�� said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at 

the Elder Wand. 

 ��I think Harry��s right,�� said Hermione quietly. 

��That wand��s more trouble than it��s worth.�� said Harry. ��And quite honestly,�� he turned away 
from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in 
Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, ��I��ve had 
enough trouble for a lifetime.��

Epilogue 
Nineteen Years Later 


Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The 


morning of 
the first of September was crisp as an apple, and as the 

little family 
bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great 

sooty station, 
the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians 

sparkled like 
cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top 

of the laden 
trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them 

hooted 
indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's 
arm.

 "It won't be long, and you'll be going too," Harry told her. 

 "Two years," sniffed Lily. "I want to go now!" 

The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier 
between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; 

his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. 

 "I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!"

 "James, give it a rest!" said Ginny. 

"I only said he might be," said James, grinning at his younger brother. "There's nothing wrong 

with that. He might be in Slytherin." 

But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With 
a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his 
mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. 

"You'll write to me, won't you?" Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the 

momentary absence of his brother.

 "Every day, if you want us to," said Ginny. 

"Not every day," said Albus quickly, "James says most people only get letters from home about 

once a month."

 "We wrote to James three times a week last year," said Ginny.

 "And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts," Harry put in. "He likes

��538ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

a laugh, your brother." 

Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the 
barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and 
three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet 
Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had 
already disappeared. 

"Where are they?" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made 

their way down the platform.

 "We'll find them," said Ginny reassuringly. 

But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their 

owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head Percy discoursing (discuss) 

loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello.

 "I think that's them, Al," said Ginny suddenly. 

A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their 

faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.

 "Hi," said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. 

Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed (smile with joy) at 
him. 

"Parked all right, then?" Ron asked Harry. "I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a 
Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner."

 "No, I didn't," said Hermione, "I had complete faith in you." 

"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him," Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted 
Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. "I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I 
can use a Supersensory Charm for that." 

Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated 
discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts. 

 "If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you," said Ron, "but no pressure." 

 "Ron!" 

 Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. 

"He doesn't mean it," said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention.

��539ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned 

for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.

 "Look who it is." 

Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. 
His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled 
Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny 
staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. 

"So that's little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure you beat him in every test, 
Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains."

 "Ron, for heaven's sake," said Hermione, half stern, half amused. "Don't try to turn them against 
each other before they've even started school!" 

"You're right, sorry," said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, "Don't get too friendly 
with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood." 

"Hey!" James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was 
evidently bursting with news. 

"Teddy's back there," he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing 
clouds of steam. "Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging Victoire!"

 He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.

 "Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked Teddy what he was 

doing -" 

 "You interrupted them?" said Ginny. "You are so like Ron -" 

"-and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!" 
James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. 

"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!" whispered Lily ecstatically. "Teddy would really 
be part of the family then!" 

"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week," said Harry "Why don't we just 
invite him to live with us and have done with it?" 

"Yeah!" said James enthusiastically. "I don't mind sharing with Al. Teddy could have my 
room!" 

"No," said Harry firmly, "you and Al will share a room only when I want the house

demolished."

 He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's.

 "It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board."

 "Don't forget to give Neville our love!" Ginny told James as she hugged him.

 "Mum! I can't give a professor love!"

 "But you know Neville -" 

 James rolled his eyes. 

"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology 
and give him love." 

Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus. 
"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals." 

 "I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!" 

But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then 
leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his 
friends. 

"Thestrals are nothing to worry about," Harry told Albus. "They're gentle things, there's nothing 
scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the 
boats."

 Ginny kissed Albus good-bye.

 "See you at Christmas." 

"Bye, Al," said Harry as his son hugged him. "Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next 
Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And don't let James 

wind you up." 

 "What if I'm in Slytherin?" 

The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could 
have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. 

Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three 
children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. 

"Ablus Severus," Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful 
enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, "you were named for two

��541ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever 

knew." 

 "But just say -" 

"-then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, 

Al. But if it matters to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat 

takes your choice into account."

 "Really?"

 "It did for me," said Harry. 

He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when 
he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of 
parents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the 
carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest 
them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. 

"Why are they all staring?" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other 
students.

 "Don't let it worry you," said Ron. "It's me, I'm extremely famous." 

Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. 

The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already 
ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little 
bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. 

The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand 
was still raised in farewell. 

"He'll be alright," murmured Ginny. 

As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on 

his forehead. "I know he will." 

The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. 

All was well.

 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 
By 

J. K. Rowling 
Oh, the torment bred in the race, 
the grinding scream of death


 

and the stroke that hits the vein, 
the haemorrhage none can staunch, the grief, 
the curse no man can bear. 


But there is a cure in the house 
and not outside it, no, 
not from others but from them, 

their bloody strife. We sing to you, 
dark gods beneath the earth. 
Now hear, you blissful powers underground - 

answer the call, send help. 
Bless the children, give them Triumph now. 

Aeschylus, The Libation Bearers 


Death is but crossing the world, as friends do the seas; they live in one another still. 
For they must needs be present, that love and live in that which is omnipresent. 
In this divine glass they see face to face; and their converse is free, as well as pure. 
This is the comfort of friends, that though they may be said to die, yet their friendship and 


society are, in the best sense, ever present, because immortal. 

William Penn, from More Fruits of Solitude

Chapter One 

The Dark Lord Ascending 

The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the 
narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands 
directed at each other's chests; then, recognizing each other, they 
stowed (put away, store) their wands beneath their cloaks and 
started walking briskly in the same direction. 

"News?" asked the taller of the two. 

"The best," replied Severus Snape. 

The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles (thorny bush), on the right by 
a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they 
marched. 

"Thought I might be late," said Yaxley, his blunt features (��ƽ������ /��� vs. sharp features 
[������ brutish�����ݣ��� chapter 12, p283]) sliding in and out of sight as the branches of 
overhanging trees broke the moonlight. "It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will 
be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?" 

Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the 
lane. The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of imposing 
wrought-iron gates barring the men's way. Neither of them broke step. In silence both raised their 
left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal was smoke. 

The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men's footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to 
their right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his companion's head, but the source of 
the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top 
of the hedge. 

��He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks ...�� Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak 
with a snort. 

A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights 
glinting in the diamond [���� ] paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond 
the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped

��3ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it. 

The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet 
covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the wall followed Snape 
and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next 
room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle. 

The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room��s usual 
furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire 
beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece��¯̨ surmounted (be on top of) by a gilded mirror. 
Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the 
lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently 
unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended 
by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table 
below. None of the people seated underneath this singular sight were looking at it except for a pale 
young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing 
upward every minute or so. 

 ��Yaxley. Snape,�� said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. ��You are very nearly late.�� 

The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the 
new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette���� . As they drew nearer, however, his face 
shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose 
pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow. 

��Severus, here,�� said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. ��Yaxley �C beside 
Dolohov.��

 The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it 
was to him that Voldemort spoke first. 

 ��So?�� 

��My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of 
safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.�� 

The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at 
Snape and Voldemort. 

��Saturday ... at nightfall,�� repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon Snape��s black ones

��4ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves 
would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into 
Voldemort��s face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort��s lipless mouth curved into something 
like a smile.

 ��Good. Very good. And this information comes �C��

 ���C from the source we discussed,�� said Snape. 

 ��My Lord.�� 

Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces 
turned to him.

 ��My Lord, I have heard differently.�� 

Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, ��Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that 

Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.��

 Snape was smiling. 

��My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a 

Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be 

susceptible.��

 ��I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,�� said Yaxley. 

��If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,�� said Snape. ��I assure you, Yaxley, the 
Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we 
have infiltrated the Ministry.�� 

��The Order��s got one thing right, then, eh?�� said a squat man sitting a short distance from 
Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there����;���� along the table. 

Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly 
overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought. 

��My Lord,�� Yaxley went on, ��Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to 
transfer the boy �C�� 

Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as 
Voldemort turned back to Snape.

 ��Where are they going to hide the boy next?�� 

��At the home of one of the Order,�� said Snape. ��The place, according to the source, has been

��5ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little 
chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before 
next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the 
enchantments to break through the rest.�� 

��Well, Yaxley?�� Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely in his red 

eyes. ��Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?��

 Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders. 

��My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have �C with difficulty, and after great effort �C 
succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.�� 

Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a 
long, twisted face, clapped him on the back. 

��It is a start,�� said Voldemort. ��But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be 
surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister��s life will set me back a 
long way.�� 

��Yes �C my Lord, that is true �C but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the 
Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-
ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to 
bring Scrimgeour down.�� 

��As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest,�� said 
Voldemort. ��At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If 
we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.�� 

��We are at an advantage there, my Lord,�� said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some 
portion of approval. ��We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical 
Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.�� 

��He will not do either,�� said Snape. ��The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is 

controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.��

 ��All the better,�� said Voldemort. ��He will have to move in the open. Easier to take, by far.�� 

Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, ��I shall attend to the 

boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them

��6ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.�� 

The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her 
expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter��s continued existence. Voldemort, 
however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the 
unconscious body above him. 

��I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but
���� the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things that I did not 
understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.��

 At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry 
of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had 
seemed to issue from below their feet. 

��Wormtail,�� said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and without 
removing his eyes from the revolving body above, ��have I not spoken to you about keeping our 
prisoner quiet?�� 

��Yes, m-my Lord,�� gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in 
his chair that it appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and 
scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver. 

��As I was saying,�� continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his followers, ��I 
understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to 
kill Potter.�� 

The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that he wanted to 
borrow one of their arms. 

��No volunteers?�� said Voldemort. ��Let��s see ... Lucius, I see no reason for you to have a wand 
anymore.�� 

Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, and his eyes 
were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse.

 ��My Lord?��

 ��Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.��

 ��I ...�� 

Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead, quite as pale as he was,

��7ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly 
on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed it 
along to Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely.

 ��What is it?��

 ��Elm, my Lord,�� whispered Malfoy.

 ��And the core?��

 ��Dragon �C dragon heartstring.�� 

��Good,�� said Voldemort. He drew out his wand and compared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made 
an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort��s 
wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened 
maliciously.

 ��Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?��

 Some of the throng sniggered. 

��I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you 
and your family seem less than happy of late ... What is it about my presence in your home that 

displeases you, Lucius?��

 ��Nothing �C nothing, my Lord!��

 ��Such lies, Lucius ... �� 

The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. One or two of 
the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard 
sliding across the floor beneath the table. 

The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort��s chair. It rose, seemingly endlessly, 
and came to rest across Voldemort��s shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man��s thigh; its eyes, 
with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long 
thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy. 

��Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot (fate, destiny)? Is my return, my rise to 
power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?�� 

��Of course, my Lord,�� said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper 
lip. ��We did desire it �C we do.�� 

To Malfoy��s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from Voldemort and the

snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced 
quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact. 

��My Lord,�� said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with emotion, ��it 
is an honor to have you here, in our family��s house. There can be no higher pleasure.�� 

She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as 
she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward 
Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness. 

��No higher pleasure,�� repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one side as he considered 

Bellatrix. ��That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.��

 Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight.

 ��My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!�� 

��No higher pleasure ... even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has taken place in your 

family this week?��

 She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused. 

 ��I don��t know what you mean, my Lord.�� 

��I��m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. She has just married 

the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.�� 

There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned forward to 
exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. The giant snake, disliking the 
disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so 
jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys�� humiliation. Bellatrix��s face, so recently flushed 
wit happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red. 

��She is no niece of ours, my Lord,�� she cried over the outpouring of mirth. ��We �C Narcissa and 
I �C have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do 
with either of us, nor any beast she marries.�� 

��What say you, Draco?�� asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly 
through the catcalls and jeers. ��Will you babysit the cubs?�� 

The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was staring down into 
his own lap, then caught his mother��s eye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed 
her own deadpan (expressionless) stare at the opposite wall.

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Enough,�� said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. ��Enough.��

 And the laughter died at once. 

��Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,�� he said as Bellatrix gazed 
at him, breathless and imploring, ��You must prune�޼�֦ yours, must you not, to keep it 
healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.�� 

��Yes, my Lord,�� whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again. ��At the 
first chance!�� 

��You shall have it,�� said Voldemort. ��And in your family, so in the world ... we shall cut away 
the canker����;����that infects us until only those of the true blood remain ...�� 

Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy��s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure 
suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to life with a groan and began to 
struggle against invisible bonds. 

 ��Do you recognize our guest, Severus?�� asked Voldemort. 

Snape raised his eyes to the upside down face. All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the 
captive now, as though they had been given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face 
the firelight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice, ��Severus! Help me!��

 ��Ah, yes,�� said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again. 

��And you, Draco?�� asked Voldemort, stroking the snake��s snout with his wand-free hand. 
Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he seemed unable to look at her 
anymore. 

��But you would not have taken her classes,�� said Voldemort. ��For those of you who do not 
know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.�� 

There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched woman with 
pointed teeth cackled. 

��Yes ... Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles ... how 
they are not so different from us ... ��

 One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape again.

 ��Severus ... please ... please ... �� 

��Silence,�� said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy��s wand, and Charity fell silent as if

��10ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

gagged. ��Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week 
Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she 
says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, 
says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance ... She would have us all mate with 
Muggles ... or, no doubt, werewolves ... �� 

Nobody laughed this time. There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemort��s 
voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her 
eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from him 
again.

 ��Avada Kedavra�� 

The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a resounding 
crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in 
their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor. 

��Dinner, Nagini,�� said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered from his 
shoulders onto the polished wood.

Chapter Two 
In Memorandum 

Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand 
swearing under his breath, he shouldered open 
door. There was a crunch of breaking china. He 
on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the 
his bedroom door. 
in his left and 
his bedroom 
had trodden 
floor outside 
"What the -?" 

He looked around, the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of 
tea was Dudley's idea of a clever booby trap���� . Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry 
scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already 
crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run 
his finger under the tap. 

It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to 
perform magic... but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have 
defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came to think of it �C 
particularly in light of his immediate plans �C this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. 
Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop 
up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind 
him. 

Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he 
had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed 
off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced��...�Ż� or updated them, leaving a 
layer of general debris at the bottom �C old quills, desiccated (dry up,) beetle eyes, single socks that 
no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch������ , experienced 
a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood. 

He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped

��12ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT 
CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold 
locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge 
that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment of the 
enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt 
cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather's last gift 
except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering gritɰ��. 

Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his 
own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning's 
Daily prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter 
memories -the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by 
attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk. 

It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items, and sort the 
remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. His school and 
Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to 
be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of 
night, probably, as if they were evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility 
Cloak, potion-making kit������ , certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, 
a stack of letters, and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the 
Marauder's Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this 
place of honor not because it was valuable �C in all usual senses it was worthless �C but because of 
what it had cost to attain it. 

This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig, one 
for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer. 

He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no movement as 
he began to flick through newspapers, throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one. The owl 
was asleep or else faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was 
allowed out of her cage at the moment.

��13ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching for one 
particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the 
summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of 
Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, 
he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for. 

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED 

By Elphias Doge 

I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual 
attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. I had 
contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was no longer 
contagious, my pock-marked���� visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to 
approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted 
notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage 
and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles. 

Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had 
committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured 
me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the 
sad business, though many attempted to make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to��inclined to, willing to�� praise his father's action and assumed that Albus too was a 
Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mistaken. As anybody who knew Albus 
would attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, his determined 
support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years. 

In a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. 
By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, 
but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of 
us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example, not to mention his 
help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me later in 
life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.

��14ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular 
correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, 
the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the 
magical theoretician���ۼ� . Several of his papers found their way into learned 
publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical 
Potioneer. Dumbledore's future career seemed likely to be meteoric��fast and brilliant��, 
and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister of Magic. 
Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job, 
however, he never had Ministerial ambitions. 

Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus's brother, Aberforth, arrived at 
school. They were not alike: Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to 
settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite 
wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along as 
comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be 
admitted that living in Albus's shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable 
experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and 
cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother. 

When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then-traditional tour of the 
world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate 
careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, 
died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my 
departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra's funeral, then left for what was now 
to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to 
them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me. 

That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, 
perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in 
Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his day-
to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in 
my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward the end of my year's travels,

��15ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

that another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana. 

Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so soon after 
the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of her brothers. All those closest to 
Albus �C and I count myself one of that lucky number �C agree that Ariana's death, and 
Albus's feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left 
their mark upon him forevermore. 

I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person's 
suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less light-hearted. To add to his 
misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and 
Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would lift �C in later years they 
reestablished, if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial (friendly) one.) However, 
he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to 
mention them. 

Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore's 
innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery of 
the twelve uses of dragon's blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he 
displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They 
say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald 
in 1945. Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they 
watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle. Dumbledore's triumph and its 
consequences for the Wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to 
match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He Who 
Must Not Be Named. 

Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, 
however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed 
him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but 
my loss is nothing compared to the Wizarding World's. That he was the most inspiring and 
best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived, working 
always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small

��16ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

boy with dragon pox as he was on the day I met him. 

Harry finished reading, but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. 
Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon 
spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled 
with a sense of humiliation. 

He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this obituary he had 
been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined 
Dumbledore's childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known 
him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like 
trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. 

He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have felt strange, 
impertinent even, but after all it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in 
that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had 
been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, 
Harry's past, Harry's future, Harry's plans... and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his 
future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he 
had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had 
ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered 
honestly, 

"What do you see when you look in the mirror?" 

"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks." 

After several minutes' thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, 
and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and its Use against the Dark 
Arts. Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It 
was much tidier. The only things left out of place were today's Daily Prophet, still lying on the 
bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror. 

Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today's Prophet, and unfolded the 
newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the

��17ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about 
Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on (depend on) the Prophet to suppress 
news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed. 

Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of 
Dumbledore striding along, looking harried, 

DUMBLEDORE �C THE TRUTH AT LAST? 

Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the 
greatest wizard of his generation. Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-
bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong 
feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave, WHY was the man 
tipped to be the Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the 
real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? HOW did 
Dumbledore really meet his end? 

The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, 
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Berry 
Braithwaite, page 13, inside. 

Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with a picture 
showing another familiar face, a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde 
hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at 
him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on. 

In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious quill-
portraits might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home, she leads me 
straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, 
a steaming vat of freshest gossip. 

"Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer's dream," says Skeeter. "Such a long, full 
life. I'm sure my book will be the first of very, very many." 

Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine-hundred-page book was completed in 
a mere four weeks after Dumbledore's mysterious death in June. I ask her how she

��18ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

managed this superfast feat. 

"Oh, when you've been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is second 

nature. I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be 

the first to meet that need." 

I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the 

Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore's, that "Skeeter's book contains 

less fact than a Chocolate Frog card." 

Skeeter throws back her head and laughs. 

"Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights, 

bless him. Completely gaga (fool, senile person), seemed to think we were sitting at the 

bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout." 

And yet Elphias Doge's accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. 

Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of 

Dumbledore's long and extraordinary life? 

"Oh, my dear," beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles (rap across 
the knuckles �C���� ), "you know as well as I do how much information can be generated 
by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word 'no,' and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes 
Quill! People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought 
he was so wonderful, you know �C he trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old Dodgy 
Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I've had access to a source most journalists 
would swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in public before and who was close 
to Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth." 

The advance publicity for Skeeter's biography has certainly suggested that there will be 

shocks in store for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a blameless life. What were 

the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask? 

"Now, come off it. Betty, I'm not giving away all the highlights before anybody's bought 

the book!" laughs Skeeter. "But I can promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore 

was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! Let's just say that nobody hearing him

��19ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that he dabbled���� ;ǳ�� in the Dark 
Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for 
tolerance, he wasn't exactly broad-minded when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore 
had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so 
hard to keep hushed up." 

I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, whose conviction 
by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago. 

"Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,�� laughs Skeeter. "No, no, I'm talking 
about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats, worse even 
than the Muggle-maiming father �C Dumbledore couldn't keep either of them quiet anyway, 
they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it's the mother and the sister that intrigued 
me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness �C but, as I say, you'll have to 
wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it's no wonder 
Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken." 

Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to 
Dumbledore's many magical discoveries? 

"He had brains," she concedes, "although many now question whether he could really 
take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor 
Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon's blood when 
Dumbledore 'borrowed' his papers." 

But the importance of some of Dumbledore's achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. 
What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald? 

"Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald," says Skeeter with such a tantalizing 
smile. "I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's spectacular victory must 
brace themselves for a bombshell �C or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. 
All I'll say is, don't be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend. After 
they've read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured 
a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!"

��20ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject, so we turn instead to 
the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other. 

"Oh yes," says Skeeter, nodding briskly, "I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter-
Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will 
have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an 
unnatural interest in Potter from the word go��һ��ʼ . Whether that was really in the 
boy's best interests �C well, we'll see. It's certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most 
troubled adolescence." 

I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so famously 
interviewed last year, a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively of his 
conviction that You-Know-Who had returned. 

"Oh, yes, we've developed a closer bond," says Skeeter. "Poor Potter has few real 
friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life �C the Triwizard 
Tournament. I am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the 
real Harry Potter." 

Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Dumbledore's final 
hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died? 

"Well, I don't want to say too much �C it's all in the book �C but eyewitnesses inside 
Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, 
jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against 
whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it seems? That is for the Wizarding 
community to decide �C once they've read my book." 

On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an 

instant bestseller. Dumbledore's legion of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is 

soon to emerge about their hero. 

Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. Revulsion 

and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the 

wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin. 

��21ҳ��

He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only 
to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from 
Rita's article echoed in his head, An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship ... 
It's been called unhealthy, even sinister ... He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth ... I've 
had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for... 

"Lies!" Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door neighbor, who had 
paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously. 

Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; he picked it 
up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita 
Skeeter was defaming him. 

A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror 
again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a 
sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia's choosing. There was nothing blue there for the mirror to 
reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye 
looking back at him. 

He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had been thinking 
of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus 
Dumbledore would never pierce him again.

Chapter Three 

The Dursleys Departing 

The sound of the front door slamming echoed 


up the stairs 
and a voice roared, ��Oi! You!�� 
Sixteen years of being addressed thus left 

Harry in no 
doubt whom his uncle was calling, nevertheless, 

he did not 
immediately respond. He was still gazing at the 

mirror 
fragment in which, for a split second, he had 

thought he 

saw Dumbledore��s eye. It was not until his uncle bellowed, "BOY!" that Harry got slowly to his 
feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack 
filled with things he would be taking with him. 

��You took you time!�� roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the top of the stairs, ��Get 
down here. I want a word!�� 

Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans' pockets. When he reached the living room 
he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for traveling; Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up 
jacket, Aunt Petunia in a neat salmon-colored coat and Dudley, Harry��s large, blond, muscular 
cousin, in his leather jacket.

 ��Yes?�� asked Harry. 

��Sit down!�� said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. ��Please!�� added Uncle Vernon, 
wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat. 

Harry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt 
Petunia and Dudley, following his movement with anxious expressions. Finally, his large purple 
face crumpled with concentration. Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke. 

"I've changed my mind,�� he said. 

"What a surprise," said Harry. 

"Don't you take that tone��" began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but Vernon Dursley waved 
her down. 

"It's all a lot of claptrap (nonsense),�� said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy little eyes. 
"I've decided I don't believe a word of it. We��re staying put, we��re not going anywhere.��

��23ҳ��

Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. Vernon Dursley 
had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four weeks, packing and 
unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry��s favorite moment had been the 
one when Uncle Vernon, unaware the Dudley had added his dumbbells���� to his case since the 
last time it been repacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot (British) luggage 
compartment of a car) and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing. 

��According to you,�� Vernon Dursley said, now resuming his pacing up and down the living 

room, ��we �C Petunia, Dudley and I �C are in danger. From �C from �C�� 

��Some of 'my lot' right?�� said Harry 

��Well, I don��t believe it,�� repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of Harry again. "I 

was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it's a plot to get the house." 

"The house?" repeated Harry. "What house?" 

"This house!" shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein his forehead starting to pulse. "Our house! 
House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and then you're going to 
do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and �C" 

��Are you out of your mind?" demanded Harry. "A plot to get this house? Are you actually as 
stupid as you look?" 

"Don't you dare -!" squealed Aunt Petunia, but again Vernon waved her down. Slights on his 
personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the danger he had spotted. 

"Just in case you've forgotten," said Harry, "I've already got a house, my godfather left me one. 
So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?" 

There was silence. 

Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument. 

"You claim," said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, "that this Lord Thing �C" 

"-Voldemort," said Harry impatiently, "and we've been through this about a hundred times 
already. This isn't a claim, it's fact. Dumbledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley 
�C" 

Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his uncle was attempting 
to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry's summer holidays, of 
two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley

��24ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

had come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr. 
Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been 
expected to delight Uncle Vernon. 

"-Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well," Harry pressed on remorselessly, "Once 
I'm seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as 
me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I 
am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I'd come and try to rescue you." 

Uncle Vernon's and Harry's eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant they were both 
wondering the same thing. 

Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, "You've got to go into hiding and the Order 
wants to help. You're being offered serious protection, the best there is." 

Uncle Vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down. Outside the sun hung low over 
the privet hedges. The next door neighbor's lawn mower stalledϨ�� again. 

"I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?" asked Vernon Dursley abruptly. 

"There is," said Harry, surprised. 

"Well, then, why can't they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing 
more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government protection!" 

Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in 
the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted. 

"You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said," Harry replied. "We think the Ministry has 
been infiltrated." 

Uncle Vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black 
mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration. 

"All right," he said. Stopping in front of Harry get again. "All right, let's say for the sake of 
argument we accept this protection. I still don't see why we can't have that Kingsley bloke." 

Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had also been addressed 
half a dozen times. 

"As I've told you," he said through gritted teeth, "Kingsley is protecting the Mug �C I mean, your 
Prime Minister." 

"Exactly �C he's the best!" said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank television screen. The

��25ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime 
Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of 
dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had 
caused the Dursleys to take to (like) Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any 
other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with earring in. 

"Well, he's taken,�� said Harry. "But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are more than up to the 
job �C" 

"If we'd even seen CVs (Curriculum Vitae -���˼��� ) ...�� began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost 
patience. 

Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the TV set himself. 

"These accidents aren't accidents �C the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever 
else has happened since we last watched the news. People are disappearing and dying and he's 
behind it �C Voldemort. I've told you this over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the 
fogs �C they're caused by dementors, and if you can't remember what they are, ask your son!" 

Dudley's hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents' and Harry's eyes upon him, 
he slowly lowered them again and asked, "There are... more of them?" 

"More?" laughed Harry. "More than the two that attacked us, you mean? Of course there are, 
there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed��send�� off fear and 
despair -" 

"All right, all right," blustered Vernon Dursley. "You've made your point �C" 

"I hope so," said Harry, "because once I'm seventeen, all of them �C Death Eaters, dementors, 
maybe even Inferi �C which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard �C will be able to find 
you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I 
think you'll agree you need help." 

There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing down a wooden front 
door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle 
Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, "But what about my 
work? What about Dudley's school? I don't suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout 
(idler, bum) wizards �C" 

"Don't you understand?" shouted Harry. "They will torture and kill you like they did my

parents!" 

"Dad," said Dudley in a loud voice, "Dad �C I'm going with these Order people." 

"Dudley," said Harry, "for the first time in your life, you're talking sense." 

He knew the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough to accept the Order's help, his 
parents would accompany him. There could be no question of being separated from their 
Duddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece. 

"They'll be here in about five minutes,�� he said, and when none of the Dursleys replied, he left 
the room. The prospect of parting �C probably forever �C from his aunt, uncle and cousin was one 
that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness 
in the air. What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years' solid dislike? 

Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a couple of owl nuts 

through the bars of Hedwig's cage. They fell with dull thuds to the bottom where she ignored them. 

"We're leaving soon, really soon," Harry told her. "And then you'll be able to fly again." 

The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and downstairs. It was too 
much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on their own. 

"Harry Potter!" squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened the door; a small man 
in a mauve [m.uv]����ɫ�� top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow. "An honor as ever!" 

"Thanks, Dedalus," said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark haired 
Hestia. "It's really good of you to do this... They're through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin...�� 

"Good day to you, Harry Potter's relatives!" said Dedalus happily striding into the living room. 
The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change of 
mind. Dudley shrank neared to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard. 

"I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told you, is a simple one," 
said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. "We shall be 
leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic in your house �C Harry being still 
underage it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him �C we shall be driving, say, ten 
miles or so before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you. You know how to 
drive, I take it?" He asked Uncle Vernon politely. 

"Know how to �C? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!" spluttered�����ܻ���˵ Uncle 
Vernon. 

��27ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Very clever of you, sir, very clever. I personally would be utterly bamboozled (confuse, 
bewilder) by all those buttons and knobs," said Dedalus. He was clearly under the impression that 
he was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word 
Dedalus spoke. 

"Can't even drive," he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling indignantly, but 
fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him. 

"You, Harry," Dedalus continued, "will wait here for your guard. There has been a little change 
in the arrangements �C" 

��What d'you mean?" said Harry at once. "I thought Mad-Eye was going to come and take me by 
Side Along-Apparition?" 

"Can't do it," said Hestia tersely, "Mad-Eye will explain." 

The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces, 
jumped as a loud voice screeched, "Hurry up!" Harry looked all around the room before realizing 
the voice had issued from Dedalus's pocket watch. 

"Quite right, we��re operating to a very tight schedule," said Dedalus nodding at his watch and 
tucking it back into his waist coat. "We are attempting to time your departure from the house with 
your family's Disapparition, Harry, thus the charm breaks the moment you all head for safety." He 
turned to the Dursleys, "Well, are we all packed and ready to go?" 

None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge in Dedalus's 
waistcoat pocket. 

"Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus," murmured Hestia. She clearly felt that it 
would be tactless for them to remain the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, 
possibly tearful farewells. 

"There's no need," Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary 

by saying loudly, 

"Well, this is good-bye then, boy." 

He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry's hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to 
face it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome��
����. 

"Ready, Duddy?" asked Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid

��28ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

looking at Harry altogether. 

Dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding Harry a little of 
the giant, Grawp. 

"Come along, then," said Uncle Vernon. 

He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, "I don't understand." 

"What don't you understand, popkin?" asked Petunia looking up at her son. 

Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry. 

"Why isn't he coming with us? 

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze when they stood staring at Dudley as though he had just 

expressed a desire to become a ballerina. 

"What?" said Uncle Vernon loudly. 

"Why isn't he coming too?" asked Dudley. 

"Well, he -doesn't want to," said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and adding, "You 
don't want to, do you?" 

"Not in the slightest," said Harry. 

"There you are�ⲻ����," Uncle Vernon told Dudley. "Now come on we're off." 

He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley did not move and after 
a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too. 

"What now?" barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway. 

It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. After several 
moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said, "But where's he going to go?" 

Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that Dudley was frightening 
them. 

Hestia Jones broke the silence. "But... surely you know where your nephew is going?" she asked 
looking bewildered. 

"Certainly we know," said Vernon Dursley. "He's off with some of your lot, isn't he? Right, 
Dudley, let's get in the car, you heard the man, we're in a hurry.�� 

Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not follow. 

"Off with some of our lot?" Hestia looked outraged. 

Harry had met this attitude before. Witches and wizards seemed stunned that his close living

��29ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter. 

"It's fine," Harry assured her. "It doesn't matter, honestly." 

"Doesn't matter?" repeated Hestia, her voice rising considerably. "Don't these people realize 

what you've been through? What danger you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of 

the anti-Voldemort movement?" 

"Er �Cno, they don't," said Harry. "They think I'm a waste of space, actually but I'm used to �C" 

"I don't think you're a waste of space (person who is stupid or useless)." 

If Harry had not seen Dudley's lips move, he might not have believed it. As it was, he stared at 

Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for 

one thing, Dudley had turned red. 

Harry was embarrassed and astonished himself. "Well... er... thanks, Dudley." 

Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy (heavy, awkward) for expression 

before mumbling, "You saved my life," 

"Not really," said Harry. "It was your soul the dementor would have taken...�� 

He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact during this summer or last, 
as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on 
(begin to understand) Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that 
morning might not have been a booby trap at all. 

Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have 
exhausted his ability to express his feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley 
subsided into scarlet-faced silence. 

Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage 
as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather than Harry. 

"S-so sweet, Dudders...�� she sobbed into his massive chest. "S-such a lovely b-boy... s-saying 
thank you...�� 

"But he hasn't said thank you at all!" said Hestia indignantly. "He only said he didn't think Harry 
was a waste of space!" 

"Yeah, but coming from Dudley that's like 'I love you,'" said Harry, torn between annoyance and 
a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from 
a burning building.

"Are we going or not?" roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living room door. "I 
thought we were on a tight schedule!" 

"Yes �C yes, we are," said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these exchanged with an air 
of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. "We really must be off. Harry -" 

He tripped������ forward and wrung Harry's hand with both of his own. 

"-good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon your 

shoulders." 

"Oh," said Harry, "right. Thanks." 

"Farwell, Harry," said Hestia also clasping his hand. "Our thoughts go with you." 

"I hope everything's okay," said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and Dudley. 

"Oh, I'm sure we shall end up the best of chums," said Diggle slightly, waving his hat as he left 
the room. Hestia followed him. 

Dudley gently released himself from his mother's clutches and walked toward Harry who had to 
repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then Dudley held out his large, pink hand. 

"Blimey, Dudley," said Harry over Aunt Petunia's renewed sobs, "did the dementors blow a 
different personality into you?" 

"Dunno," muttered Dudley, "See you, Harry." 

"Yea ...�� said Harry, taking Dudley's hand and shaking it. "Maybe. Take care, Big D." 

Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry heard his heavy footfalls on the 

graveled drive, and then a car door slammed. 

Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, looked around at the sound. She 
did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet 
handkerchief into her pocket, she said, "Well �C good-bye" and marched towards the door without 
looking at him. 

"Good-bye," said Harry. 

She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to 
say something to him. 

She gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with 
a little jerk of her head, she hustled out of the room after he husband and son.

Chapter Four 

The Seven Potters 

Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, 


arriving at the 
window just in time to see the Dursleys' car 

swinging out 
of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus��s top 

hat was 
visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the 

backseat. The 
car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its 

windows 
burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting 

sun, and then 
it was gone. 

Harry picked up Hedwig��s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy 
bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, 
where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading 
rapidly, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence 
and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time. 

Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the 
hours of solitude had been a rare treat. Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he 
had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley��s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the 
channels to his heart��s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling remembering those times; it was 
like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost. 

��Don��t you want to take a last look at the place?�� he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with 
her head under her wing. ��We��ll never be here again. Don��t you want to remember all the good 
times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories ... Dudley sobbed on it after I saved him from 
the dementors ... Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? ... And last summer, 
Dumbledore walked through that front door ...�� 

Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve 
it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door. 

��And under here, Hedwig�� �C Harry pulled open a door under the stairs �C ��is where I used to 
sleep! You never knew me then �C Blimey, it��s small, I��d forgotten ... �� 

Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake

��32ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned 
with a spider or two. 

Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had 
found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But 
Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days, confused dreams 
involving flashes of green light and once �C Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry 
had recounted it �C a flying motorbike ... 

There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk 
and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle 
Vernon��s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring 
out of the window into the back garden. 

The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, figures began to 
pop���� into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, 
wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar 
attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, 
black winged horses. 

Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a general cry of 
greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, 
��All righ��, Harry? Ready fer the off?�� 

��Definitely,�� said Harry, beaming around at them all. ��But I wasn��t expecting this many of 
you!�� 

��Change of plan,�� growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous bulging sacks, and 
whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. 
��Let��s get undercover before we talk you through it.�� 

Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, 
sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia��s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless 
appliances; Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and 
George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, 
balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye 
whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin,

��33ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald 
and broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting 
his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog��������� ;�ͼ��� , 
with his droopy beady hound��s eyes and matted hair. Harry��s heart seemed to expand and glow at 
the sight. He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle 
the last time they had met. 

��Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?�� he called across the 

room.

 ��He can get along without me for one night,�� said Kingsley, ��You��re more important.�� 

��Harry, guess what?�� said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine, and she 

wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glistened there. 

 ��You got married?�� Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin.

 ��I��m sorry you couldn��t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.��

 ��That��s brilliant, congrat �C�� 

��All right, all right, we��ll have time for a cozy catch-up later,�� roared Moody over the hubbub 

(disturbance, commotion), and silence fell in the kitchen. 

Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. ��As Dedalus probably told you, we 
had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He��s made it 
an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or 
Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in 
at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother��s charm does that already. What he��s really 
done is to stop you getting out of here safely.��

 ��Second problem, you��re underage, which means you��ve still got the Trace on you.��

 ��I don��t �C�� 

��The Trace, the Trace!�� said Mad-Eye impatiently. ��The charm that detects magical activity 
around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone 
around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will 
the Death Eaters. 

��We can��t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen you��ll lose all 
the protection your mother gave you. In short, Pius Thicknesse thinks he��s got you cornered good

��34ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and proper.��

 Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse.

 ��So what are we going to do?�� 

��We��re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can��t detect, 
because we don��t need to cast spells to use them, brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid��s motorbike.�� 

Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to 
address them. 

��Now, your mother��s charm will only break under two conditions, when you come of age, or -�� 
Moody gestured around the pristine��immaculate�� kitchen, ��-you no longer call this place 
home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding 
that you��re never going to live together again, correct?��

 Harry nodded. 

��So this time, when you leave, there��ll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment 
you get outside its range. We��re choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for 
You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen. 

��The one thing we��ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn��t know we��re moving you 
tonight. We��ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry. They think you��re not leaving until the thirtieth. 
However, this is You-Know-Who we��re dealing with, so we can��t rely on him getting the date 
wrong; he��s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in 
case. So, we��ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. They all 
look like they could be the place we��re going to hide you, they��ve all got some connection with the 
Order, my house, Kingsley��s place, Molly��s Auntie Muriel��s �C you get the idea.��

 ��Yeah,�� said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan. 

��You��ll be going to Tonks��s parents. Once you��re within the boundaries of the protective 
enchantments we��ve put on their house you��ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any 
questions?�� 

��Er �C yes,�� said Harry. ��Maybe they won��t know which of the twelve secure houses I��m 
heading for at first, but won��t it be sort of obvious once�� �C he performed a quick headcount �C 
��fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks��s parents?�� 

��Ah,�� said Moody, ��I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won��t be flying to

��35ҳ��

Tonks��s parents. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them 
with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.�� 

From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. There was no 
need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.

 ��No!�� he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. ��No way!��

 ��I told them you��d take it like this,�� said Hermione with a hint of complacency.

 ��If you think I��m going to let six people risk their lives -!��

 ��- because it��s the first time for all of us,�� said Ron. 

 ��This is different, pretending to be me �C�� 

��Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,�� said Fred earnestly. ��Imagine if something went 

wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.��

 Harry did not smile. ��You can��t do it if I don��t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.�� 

��Well, that��s the plan scuppered (British) destroy),�� said George. ��Obviously there��s no chance 
at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.�� 

��Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who��s not allowed to use magic; we��ve got no chance,�� 
said Fred.

 ��Funny,�� said Harry, ��really amusing.�� 

��If it has to come to force, then it will,�� growled Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little 
in its socket as he glared at Harry. ��Everyone here��s overage, Potter, and they��re all prepared to 
take the risk.�� 

Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of 
the side of Moody��s head. 

��Let��s have no more arguments. Time��s wearing onʱ������� . I want a few of your hairs, 
boy, now.��

 ��But this is mad, there��s no need �C�� 

��No need!�� snarled Moody. ��With You-Know-Who out there and half the Ministry on his side? 
Potter, if we��re lucky he��ll have swallowed the fake bait and he��ll be planning to ambush you on 
the thirtieth, but he��d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it��s what I��d do. 
They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother��s charm holds, but it��s about 
to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use decoysȦ�� ,��

��36ҳ��

ƭ. Even You-Know-Who can��t split himself into seven.��

 Harry caught Hermione��s eye and looked away at once. 

 ��So, Potter �C some of your hair, if you please.��

 Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way.

 ��Now!�� barked Moody. 

With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed a hank (coil) 
of hair, and pulled. 

��Good,�� said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion. 
��Straight in here, if you please.�� 

Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with its surface, 
the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold. 

��Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,�� said Hermione, before catching 
sight of Ron��s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, ��Oh, you know what I mean �C 
Goyle��s potion tasted like bogies.��

 ��Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,�� said Moody.

 Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia��s gleaming sink. 

 ��We��re one short,�� said Lupin. 

��Here,�� said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped 
him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred 

and George instead.

 ��I��m a soldier, I��d sooner be a protector,�� said Mundungus. 

��Shut it,�� growled Moody. ��As I��ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we 
run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who 
would want to finish Potter in person. It��ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, 
the Death Eaters��ll want to kill them.�� 

Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen 
eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice 
Potion into each one. 

 ��Altogether, then ... �� 

Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped and grimaced

��37ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

as the potion hit their throats; At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. 
Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and George were shrinking; their 
hair was darkening, Hermione��s and Fleur��s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls. 

Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with 
him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of 
him.

 Fred and George turned to each other and said together, ��Wow �C we��re identical!�� 

��I dunno, though, I think I��m still better-looking,�� said Fred, examining his reflection in the 
kettle. 

��Bah,�� said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, ��Bill, don��t look at me �C I��m 
��ideous.�� 

��Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I��ve got smaller here,�� said Moody, indicating the first 
sack, ��and vice versa. Don��t forget the glasses, there��s six pairs in the side pocket. And when 
you��re dressed, there��s luggage in the other sack.�� 

The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he 
had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangersĳ�˵ĸ��� (���Ե�
��) rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things 
away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping 
off with impunity (without punishment), clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they 
would have been with their own. 

 ��I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,�� said Ron, looking down at his bare chest.

 ��Harry, your eyesight really is awful,�� said Hermione, as she put on glasses. 

Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a stuffed snowy 
owl, from the second sack. 

��Good,�� said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden Harrys faced 

him. ��The pairs will be as follows, Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom �C��

 ��Why��m I with you?�� grunted the Harry nearest the back door. 

��Because you��re the one that needs watching,�� growled Moody, and sure enough, his magical 
eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, ��Arthur and Fred �C�� 

��I��m George,�� said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. ��Can��t you even tell us apart when

��38ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

we��re Harry?��

 ��Sorry, George �C��

 ��I��m only yanking your wand, I��m Fred really �C�� 

��Enough messing around!�� snarled Moody. ��The other one �C George or Fred or whoever you 

are �C you��re with Remus. Miss Delacour �C��

 ��I��m taking Fleur on a thestral,�� said Bill. ��She��s not that fond of brooms.�� 

Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy (overly sentimental), slavish look 

that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again.

 ��Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral �C�� 

Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley��s smile; Harry knew that Hermione too 
lacked confidence on a broomstick. 

��Which leaves you and me, Ron!�� said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree�ұ��� as she 
waved at him.

 Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione. 

��An�� you��re with me, Harry. That all righ��?�� said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. ��We��ll be on 

the bike, brooms an�� thestrals can��t take me weight, see. Not a lot o�� room on the seat with me on 

it, though, so you��ll be in the sidecar.��

 ��That��s great,�� said Harry, not altogether truthfully. 

��We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,�� said Moody, who seemed to 
guess how Harry was feeling. ��Snape��s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he��s 
never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we��re betting they��ll choose one of 
the Potters who looks at home on a broomstick. All right then,�� he went on, tying up the sack with 
the fake Potters�� clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, ��I make it three minutes until 
we��re supposed to leave. No point locking the back door, it won��t keep the Death Eaters out when 
they come looking. Come on ...�� 

Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig��s cage and followed the group to the 
dark back garden. 

On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been helped up onto 
a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside 
the motorbike, goggles on. 

��39ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Is this it? Is this Sirius��s bike?�� 

��The very same,�� said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. ��An�� the last time yeh was on it, Harry, 
I could fit yeh in one hand!�� 

Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It placed him several 
feet below everybody else, Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper 
car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig��s cage 
between his knees. He was extremely uncomfortable. 

��Arthur��s done a bit o�� tinkerin��,�� said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry��s discomfort. He settled 
himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. ��It��s got a 
few tricks up its sleeves (concealed, hidden) now. Tha�� one was my idea.�� He pointed a thick 
finger at a purple button near the speedometer. 

"Please be careful, Hagrid." said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his 
broomstick. "I'm still not sure that was advisable and it's certainly only to be used in emergencies." 

"All right, then." said Moody. "Everyone ready, please. I want us all to leave at exactly the same 
time or the whole point of the diversion's lost." 

Everybody motioned their heads. 

"Hold tight now, Ron," said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a forcing, guilty look at Lupin 
before placing his hands on each side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life, it roared 
like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. 

��Good luck, everyone,�� shouted Moody. ��See you all in about an hour at the Burrow. On the 
count of three. One ... two .. THREE.��

 There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch. He was 
rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him 
brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. His legs, jammed 
into the sidecar by Hedwig��s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So 
great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four Privet Drive. 
By the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. 

And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty hooded figures, 
suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the middle of which the Order members had risen, 
oblivious �C 

��40ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Screams, a blaze of green light on every side, Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. 
Harry lost any sense of where they were. Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging 
to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his 
knees �C 

"No �C HELP!" 

The broomstick spun too, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of 
the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, and then another burst 
of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. 

"No �C NO!" 

The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid 
blasted through their circle. 

"Hedwig �C Hedwig �C" 

But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He could not take it in, 
and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of 
people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, 
but he could not tell who they were �C 

"Hagrid, we've got to go back, we've got to go back!" he yelled over the thunderous roar of the 
engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig's cage into the floor, refusing to believe that she 
was dead. "Hagrid, TURN AROUND!" 

"My job's ter get you there safe, Harry!" bellow Hagrid, and he opened the throttle����. 

"Stop �C STOP!" Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his 
left ear, Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for 
Hagrid's broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more 
curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around 
he cried, "Stupefy!" and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the 
four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to avoid it. 

"Hold on, Harry, this'll do for 'em!" roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see 
Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. 

A wall, a solid black wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it 
expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was

��41ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

not so lucky; He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his 
broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne 
wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up. 

More Killing Curses flew past Harry's head from the two remaining Death Eaters' wands; they 
were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells, Red and green collided in 
midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles 
below who would have no idea what was happening �C 

"Here we go again, Harry, hold on!" yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a second button. This time 
a great net burst from the bike's exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they 
swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught 
up. He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, 
all shooting curses after it. 

"This'll do it, Harry, hold on tight!" yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his whole hand onto 
the purple button beside the speedometer. 

With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-hot and blue, 
and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death 
Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar 
sway ominously, its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration. 

"It's all righ', Harry!" bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed; 
nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike's slipstream. 

"I'm on it, Harry, don' worry!" Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his 
flowery pink umbrella. 

"Hagrid! No! Let me!" 

"REPARO!" 

There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely. Harry sped 

forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike's flight, then the sidecar began to lose height �C 

In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, "Wingardium Leviosa!" 

The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne. He had but a split second's 
relief, however, as more curses streaked past him, the three Death Eaters were closing in. 

"I'm comin', Harry!" Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar

��42ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

beginning to sink again, Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming 
figures and yelled, "Impedimenta!" 

The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest; for a moment the man was absurdly spreadeagled 
in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier, one of his fellows almost collided with 
him �C 

Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to 

Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat �C 

"I'm comin', Harry, I'm comin'!" 

A huge hand seized the back of Harry's robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; 
Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbike's seat and found 
himself back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death 
Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, 
"Confringo!" 

He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it 
was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished. 

"Harry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," moaned Hagrid, "I shouldn'ta tried ter repair it meself �C yeh've got 
no room �C" 

"It's not a problem, just keep flying!" Harry shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged 
out of the darkness, drawing closer. 

As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged, 
Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so 
insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding 
them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them, the closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his 
hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of 
Stanley Shunpike �C Stan �C 

"Expelliarmus!" Harry yelled. 

"That's him, it's him, it's the real one!" 

The hooded Death Eater's shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the motorbike's 
engine. Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view. 

"Harry, what's happened?" bellowed Hagrid. "Where've they gone?" 

��43ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I don't know!" 

But Harry was afraid. The hooded Death Eater had shouted, "It's the real one!"; how had he 
known? He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they? 

He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of Hagrid's jacket. 

"Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let's get out of here!" 

"Hold on tight, then, Harry!" 

There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust, 

Harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had. Hagrid flung backward 

upon him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars �C 

"I think we've lost 'em Harry, I think we've done it!" yelled Hagrid. 

But Harry was not convinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was 

sure would come... Why had they fallen back? One of them had still had a wand... It's him... it's the 

real one... They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan.. 

"We're nearly there, Harry, we've nearly made it!" shouted Hagrid. 

Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as 
stars. 

Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire, as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the 
bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind �C 

And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or 
thestral to hold him, his snake-like face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his 
wand again �C 

Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for 
dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly 
past him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the 
engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control �C 

Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, which down, His 
scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet 
from him, he saw it raise its arm �C 

"NO!" 

With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to his horror,

��44ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater, falling out of sight, their combined weight too much 

for the broomstick �C 

Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard Voldemort scream, "Mine!" 

It was over, He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed another Death Eater 

swooping out of the way and heard, "Avada �C" 

As the pain from Harry's scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own accord. He felt it 
drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed 
eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death Eater yelled; Voldemort 
screamed, "NO!" Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched 
it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the 
ground. 

"Hagrid!" Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. "Hagrid �C Accio Hagrid!" 

The motorbike sped up, sucked towards the earth. Face level with the handlebars, Harry could 
see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer, He was going to crash and there was 
nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, "Your wand, Selwyn, give me your 
wand!" 

He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was 
sure they would be the last thing he ever saw, Voldemort preparing to curse him once more. 

And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground 
below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with an 
earsplitting, ground trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy pond.

Chapter Five 
Fallen Warrior 



"Hagrid?" 

Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris 


of metal and 
leather that surrounded him; his hands sank into 

inches of 
muddy water as he tried to stand. He could not 

understand 
where Voldemort had gone and expected him to 

swoop out of 
the darkness at any moment. Something hot and wet 

was trickling 
down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the 

pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid. 

"Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me �C" 

But the dark mass did not stir. 

"Who's there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?" 

Harry did not recognize the man's voice. Then a woman shouted. "They've crashed. Ted! 

Crashed in the garden!" 

Harry's head was swimming. 

"Hagrid," he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled. 

The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions, with a burning 
sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead 
was still throbbing. 

"Hagrid?" 

He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room. 
His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man 
was watching Harry anxiously. 

"Hagrid's fine, son," said the man, "the wife's seeing to him now. How are you feeling? 
Anything else broken? I've fixed your ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I'm Ted, by the way, Ted 
Tonks �C Dora's father." 

Harry sat up too quickly. Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy.

��46ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Voldemort �C" 

"Easy, now," said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder and pushing him back against 
the cushions. "That was a nasty crash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong 
with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?" 

"No," said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. "Death Eaters, loads of them �C we were 
chased �C" 

"Death Eaters?" said Ted sharply. "What d'you mean, Death Eaters? I thought they didn't know 
you were being moved tonight, I thought �C" 

"They knew," said Harry. 

Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above. 

"Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don't we? They shouldn't be able to get within 

a hundred yards of the place in any direction." 

Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the point when the 
motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order's charms. He only hoped they would continue to work, 
He imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate 
what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble. 

He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes before he would 
believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid 
squeezed through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but miraculously alive. 

"Harry!" 

Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra֩�뱧����ֲ�� , he covered the floor 
between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired 
ribs. "Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o' that? I thought we were both goners." 

"Yeah, me too. I can't believe �C" 

Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid. 

"You!" he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty. 

"Your wand's here, son," said Ted, tapping it on Harry's arm. "It fell right beside you, I picked it 
up... And that's my wife you're shouting at." 

"Oh, I'm �C I'm sorry." 

As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks's resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became

much less pronounced, Her hair was a light��s soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. 
Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry's exclamation. 

"What happened to our daughter?" she asked. "Hagrid said you were ambushed; where is 
Nymphadora?" 

"I don't know," said Harry. "We don't know what happened to anyone else." 

She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the sight of their 
expressions, if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He had consented to the 
plan, given them his hair... 

"The Portkey," he said, remembering all of a sudden. "We've got to get back to the Burrow and 
find out �C then we'll be able to send you word, or �C or Tonks will, once she's �C" 

"Dora'll be ok, Dromeda," said Ted. "She knows her stuff, she's been in plenty of tight spots 
(difficult positions) with the Aurors. The Portkey's through here," he added to Harry. "It's 
supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it." 

"Yeah, we do," said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders. "I �C" 

He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for 
which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him that he did not seem hollow and 
insincere. 

"I'll tell Tonks �C Dora �C to send word, when she ... Thanks for patching us up, thanks for 
everything, I �C" 

He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom. 
Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel. 

"There you go, son. That's the Portkey." 

Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush��ˢlying on the dressing table. 

"Thanks," said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave. 

"Wait a moment," said Hagrid, looking around. "Harry, where's Hedwig?" 

"She ... she got hit," said Harry. 

The realization crashed over him, He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes. The 
owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been 
forced to return to the Dursleys. 

Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder.

"Never mind," he said gruffly, "Never mind. She had a great old life �C" 

"Hagrid!" said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue, and Hagrid only just 
got his forefinger to it in time. 

With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward, 
Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he 
and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Second later, Harry's feet slammed onto hard ground 
and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. He heard screams. Throwing aside 
the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and 
Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, 
clambered laboriously to his feet. 

"Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?" cried Mrs. Weasley. 

"What d'you mean? Isn't anyone else back?" Harry panted. 

The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley's pale face. 

"The Death Eaters were waiting for us," Harry told her, "We were surrounded the moment we 
took off �C they knew it was tonight �C I don't know what happened to anyone else, four of them 
chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with us �C" 

He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to understand why he did not 
know what had happened to her sons, but �C 

"Thank goodness you're all right," she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved. 

"Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?" asked Hagrid a little shakily, "Fer medicinal 

purposes?" 

She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward the crooked house, Harry 
knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for 
information at once. 

"Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Portkey, it came back 
without them," she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. "And that one," she 
pointed at an ancient sneaker, "should have been Dad and Fred's, they were supposed to be second. 
You and Hagrid were third and," she checked her watch, "if they made it, George and Lupin ought 
to be back in about a minute." 

Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. He uncorked

it and drank it straight down in one. 

"Mum!" shouted Ginny pointing to a spot several feet away. 

A blue light had appeared in the darkness. It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin and George 
appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately that there was something wrong, 
Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood. 

Harry ran forward and seized George's legs. Together, he and Lupin carried George into the 
house and through the kitchen to the living room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the 
lamplight fell across George's head, Ginny gasped and Harry's stomach lurched, one of George's 
ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood. 

No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son that Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and 
dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his 
bulk through the back door. 

"Oi!" said Hagrid indignantly, "Le' go of him! Le' go of Harry!" 

Lupin ignored him. 

"What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?" 
he said, giving Harry a small shake. "Answer me!" 

"A �C a grindylow in a tank, wasn't it?" 

Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. 

"Wha' was tha' about?" roared Hagrid. 

"I'm sorry, Harry, but I had to check," said Lupin tersely. "We've been betrayed. Voldemort 

knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were 

directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor." 

"So why aren' you checkin' me?" panted Hagrid, still struggling with the door. 

"You're half-giant," said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. "The Polyjuice Potion is designed for 

human use only." 

"None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight," said Harry. The idea 
was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. "Voldemort only caught up with me 
toward the end, he didn't know which one I was in the beginning. If he'd been in on the plan he'd 
have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid." 

"Voldemort caught up with you?" said Lupin sharply. "What happened? How did you escape?" 

��50ҳ��

Harry explained how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true 
Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who had 
appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks's parents. 

"They recognized you? But how? What had you done?" 

"I ...�� Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion. "I 
saw Stan Shunpike ... You know, the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried 
to Disarm him instead of �C well, he doesn't know what he's doing, does he? He must be 
Imperiused!" 

Lupin looked aghast. 

"Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least 
Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!" 

"We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd fallen, he'd 
have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two 
years ago," Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias 
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore's Army how to Disarm. 

"Yes, Harry," said Lupin with painful restraint, "and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed 
that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under the imminent threat of 
death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first 
occasion was close to suicidal!" 

"So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?" said Harry angrily. 

"Of course not," said Lupin, "but the Death Eaters �C frankly, most people! �C would have 
expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to 
think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!" 

Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him. 

"I won't blast people out of my way just because they're there," said Harry, "That's Voldemort's 
job." 

Lupin's retort was lost. 

Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; it 
collapsed beneath him. 

Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again. "Will George be okay?"

��51ҳ��

All Lupin's frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question. 

"I think so, although there's no chance of replacing his ear, not when it's been cursed off �C" 

There was a scuffling���Ž��� from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt over 
Hagrid's legs and sprinted into the yard. 

Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized they were 
Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat 
hanger. Hermione flung herself into Harry's arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of 
any of them. Over Hermione's shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin's chest. 

"The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us!" 

"'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,'" said Lupin calmly. 

Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, "It's him, I've checked!" 

"All right, all right!" said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak, "But somebody 
betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!" 

"So it seems," replied Lupin, "but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven 

Harrys." 

"Small comfort!" snarled Kingsley. "Who else is back?" 

"Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me." 

Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. 

"What happened to you?" Lupin asked Kingsley. 

"Followed by five, injured two, might've killed one," Kingsley reeled off (say easily), "and we 

saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly. 

Remus, he can �C" 

"Fly," supplied Harry. "I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me." 

"So that's why he left, to follow you!" said Kingsley, "I couldn't understand why he'd vanished. 

But what made him change targets?" 

"Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike," said Lupin. 

"Stan?" repeated Hermione. "But I thought he was in Azkaban?" 

Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. "Hermione, there's obviously been a mass breakout which the 
Ministry has hushed up. Travers's hood fell off when I cursed him, he's supposed to be inside too. 
But what happened to you, Remus? Where's George?" 

��52ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"He lost an ear," said Lupin. 

"Lost an -?" repeated Hermione in a high voice. 

"Snape's work," said Lupin. 

"Snape?" shouted Harry. "You didn't say �C" 

"He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a specialty of Snape's. I wish I 
could say I'd paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he 
was injured, he was losing so much blood." 

Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no sign of 
movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying friends. Where was 
Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-Eye, and 
Mundungus? 

"Harry, give us a hand!" called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again. 
Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free. They headed through the empty kitchen and back 
into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs. Weasley 
had staunched (cause a wound to stop bleeding) his bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw 
a clean gaping hole where George's ear had been. 

"How is he?" 

Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, "I can't make it grow back, not when it's been removed 
by Dark Magic. But it could've been so much worse ... He's alive." 

"Yeah," said Harry. "Thank God." 

"Did I hear someone else in the yard?" Ginny asked. 

"Hermione and Kingsley," said Harry. 

"Thank goodness," Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry wanted to hug her, hold 
on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the 
impulse, there was a great crash from the kitchen. 

"I'll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I've seen my son, now back off if you know what's good for 
you!" 

Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into the living room, his 
bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but 
uninjured. 

��53ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Arthur!" sobbed Mrs. Weasley. "Oh thank goodness!" 

"How is he?" 

Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first time since Harry had known him, 
Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin's wound as if he 

could not believe what he was seeing. 

Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father's arrival, George stirred. 

"How do you feel, Georgie?" whispered Mrs. Weasley. 

George's fingers groped for the side of his head. 

"Saint-like," he murmured. 

"What's wrong with him?" croaked Fred, looking terrified. "Is his mind affected?" 

"Saint-like," repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. "You see... I'm 
holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?" 

Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred's pale face. "Pathetic," he told 
George. "Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?" 

"Ah well," said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. "You'll be able to tell us apart now, 
anyway, Mum." He looked around. "Hi, Harry �C you are Harry, right?" 

"Yeah, I am," said Harry, moving closer to the sofa. 

"Well, at least we got you back okay," said George. "Why aren't Ron and Bill huddled round my 
sickbed?" 

"They're not back yet, George," said Mrs. Weasley. George's grin faded. Harry glanced at Ginny 
and motioned to her to accompany him back outside. 

As they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice. "Ron and Tonks should be back by 
now. They didn't have a long journey; Auntie Muriel's not that far from here." 

Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but 
now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. 
As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand. 

Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky every time he turned. Harry 
was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and 
Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None of them looked around when 
Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.

The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slightest breath of wind 
made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing 
Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves �C 

And then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground �C 

"It's them!" screamed Hermione. 

Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere. 

"Remus!" Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin's arms. His face was set and 
white. He seemed unable to speak, Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione. 

"You're okay," he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly. "I thought �C I 

thought �C" 

"'M all right," said Ron, patting her on the back. "'M fine." 

"Ron was great," said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. "Wonderful. Stunned one 

of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you're aiming at a moving target from a flying 

broom �C" 

"You did?" said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck. 

"Always the tone of surprise," he said a little grumpily, breaking free. "Are we the last back?" 

"No," said Ginny, "we're still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye and Mundungus. I'm 

going to tell Mum and Dad you're okay, Ron �C" 

She ran back inside. 

"So what kept you? What happened?" Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks. 

"Bellatrix," said Tonks. "She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus. She tried very 

hard to kill me. I just wish I'd got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus ... 

Then we got to Ron's Auntie Muriel's and we missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us �C" 

A muscle was jumping in Lupin's jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else. 

"So what happened to you lot?" Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley. 

They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the continued absence of Bill, 
Fleur, Mad-Eye and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder 
to ignore. 

"I'm going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an hour ago," said 
Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. "Let me know when they're back." 

��55ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the 
gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow's 
boundaries. 

Mr. And Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind them. Both parents 

hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks. 

"Thank you," said Mrs. Weasley, "for our sons." 

"Don't be silly, Molly," said Tonks at once. 

"How's George?" asked Lupin. 

"What's wrong with him?" piped up Ron. 

"He's lost �C" 

But the end of Mrs. Weasley's sentence was drowned in a general outcry. A thestral had just 

soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but 

unhurt. 

"Bill! Thank God, thank God �C" 

Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. Looking 
directly at his father, he said, "Mad-Eye's dead." 

Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside him was falling, falling 
through the earth, leaving him forever. 

"We saw it," said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the 
kitchen window. "It happened just after we broke out of the circle, Mad-Eye and Dung were close 
by us, they were heading north too. Voldemort �C he can fly �C went straight for them. Dung 
panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort's curse 
hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off his broom and �C there was nothing we could do, 
nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our own tail �C" 

Bill's voice broke. 

"Of course you couldn't have done anything," said Lupin. 

They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend it. Mad-Eye dead; it 
could not be ... Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor... 

At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no point of waiting 
in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. And Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow,

��56ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing together. 

"What's wrong?" said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered, "What's happened? Who's -?" 

"Mad-Eye," said Mr. Weasley, "Dead." 

The twins' grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know what to do. Tonks was 
crying silently into a handkerchief, she had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and 
his prot��g��e at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the floor in the corner where 
he had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief. 

Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-whisky and some glasses. 

"Here," he said, and with a wave of his wand, he sent twelve full glasses soaring through the 
room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. "Mad-Eye." 

"Mad-Eye," they all said, and drank. 

"Mad-Eye," echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup. The firewhisky seared Harry's throat. It 

seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, firing him 

with something that was like courage. 

"So Mundungus disappeared?" said Lupin, who had drained his own glass in one. 

The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching Lupin, both wanting him to 

go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what they might hear. 

"I know what you're thinking," said Bill, "and I wondered that too, on the way back here, 
because they seemed to be expecting us, didn't they? But Mundungus can't have betrayed us. They 
didn't know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case 
you've forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery (deception, 
trickery). Why wouldn't he have told them the essential point? I think Dung panicked, it's as simple 
as that. He didn't want to come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who 
went straight for them. It was enough to make anyone panic." 

"You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to," sniffed Tonks. "Mad-Eye said 
he'd expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, 
and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley." 

"Yes, and zat eez all very good," snapped Fleur, "but still eet does not explain 'ow zey know we 
were moving 'Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must 'ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date 
to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze 'ole plan."

She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face, silently daring any of 
them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid 
hiccupping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had just risked his own 
life to save Harry's �C Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into 
giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon's egg. 

"No," Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised, The firewhisky seemed to have 
amplified his voice. "I mean ... if somebody made a mistake," Harry went on, "and let something 
slip, I know they didn't mean to do it. It's not their fault," he repeated, again a little louder than he 
would usually have spoken. "We've got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don't think anyone in 
this room would ever sell me to Voldemort." 

More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry felt a little hot again, and 
drank some more firewhisky for something to do. As he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye 
had always been scathing about Dumbledore's willingness to trust people. 

"Well said, Harry," said Fred unexpectedly. 

"Year, 'ear, 'ear," said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of whose mouth twitched. 

Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close to pitying. 

"You think I'm a fool?" demanded Harry. 

"No, I think you're like James," said Lupin, "who would have regarded it as the height of 
dishonor to mistrust his friends." 

Harry knew what Lupin was getting at, that his father had been betrayed by his friend Peter 
Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set 
down his glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, "There's work to do. I can ask Kingsley 
whether �C" 

"No," said Bill at once, "I'll do it, I'll come." 

"Where are you going?" said Tonks and Fleur together. 

"Mad-Eye's body," said Lupin. "We need to recover it." 

"Can't it -?" began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill. 

"Wait?" said Bill, "Not unless you'd rather the Death Eaters took it?" 

Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said goodbye and left. 

The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who remained standing. The

��58ҳ��

suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence. 

"I've got to go too," said Harry. 

Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him. 

"Don't be silly, Harry," said Mrs. Weasley, "What are you talking about?" 

"I can't stay here." 

He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, he had not hurt like this for more than a year. 

"You're all in danger while I'm here. I don't want �C" 

"But don't be so silly!" said Mrs. Weasley. "The whole point of tonight was to get you here 

safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur's agreed to get married here rather than in France, 

we've arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you �C" 

She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better. 

"If Voldemort finds out I'm here �C" 

"But why should he?" asked Mrs. Weasley. 

"There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry," said Mr. Weasley. "He's got no way of 

knowing which safe house you're in." 

"It's not me I'm worried for!" said Harry. 

"We know that," said Mr. Weasley quietly, "but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather 
pointless if you left." 

"Yer not goin' anywhere," growled Hagrid. "Blimey, Harry, after all we wen' through ter get you 
here?" 

"Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?" said George, hoisting himself up on his cushions. 

"I know that �C" 

"Mad-Eye wouldn't want �C" 

"I KNOW!" Harry bellowed. 

He felt beleaguered and blackmailed, did they think he did not know what they had done for 
him, didn't they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now, before 
they had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar 
continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley. 

"Where's Hedwig, Harry?" she said coaxingly. "We can put her up with Pigwidgeon and give 
her something to eat."

His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the last of his 
firewhisky to avoid answering. 

"Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry," said Hagrid. "Escaped him, fought him off when he 
was right on top of yeh!" 

"It wasn't me," said Harry flatly. "It was my wand. My wand acted of its own accord." 

After a few moments, Hermione said gently, "But that's impossible, Harry. You mean that you 

did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively." 

"No," said Harry. "The bike was falling, I couldn't have told you where Voldemort was, but my 
wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn't even a spell I 
recognized. I've never made gold flames appear before." 

"Often," said Mr. Weasley, "when you're in a pressured situation you can produce magic you 
never dreamed of. Small children often find, before they're trained �C" 

"It wasn't like that," said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning. He felt angry and 
frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemort's. 

No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he came to think of it, 
he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before. 

His scar seared with pain, it was all he could do not to moan aloud. Muttering about fresh air, he 
set down his glass and left the room. 

As he crossed the yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up �C rustled its enormous batlike wings, 
then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown 
plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore. 

Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would have known how and 
why Harry's wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; he had 
known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand 
and Voldemort's. But Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all 
were gone where Harry could never talk to them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had 
nothing to do with firewhisky. 

And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his forehead and closed 
his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head. 

"You told me the problem would be solved by using another's wand!"

And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated [i'me...e.t] old man lying in rags upon a 

stone floor, screaming, a horrible drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable agony... 

"No! No! I beg you, I beg you ...�� 

"You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!" 

"I did not... I swear I did not... " 

"You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!" 

"I swear I did not... I believed a different wand would work." 

"Explain, then, what happened. Lucius's wand is destroyed!" 

"I cannot understand... The connection ... exists only between your two wands." 

"Lies!" 

"Please ... I beg you... " 

And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger, saw 

the frail old main on the floor writhe in agony �C 

"Harry?" 

It was over as quickly as it had come, Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate 

into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was several moments before he realized 

that Ron and Hermione were at his side. 

"Harry, come back in the house," Hermione whispered, "You aren't still thinking of leaving?" 

"Yeah, you've got to stay, mate," said Ron, thumping Harry on the back. 

"Are you all right?" Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry's face. "You look 

awful!" 

"Well," said Harry shakily, "I probably look better than Ollivander...�� 

When he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appalled, but Hermione 
downright terrified. 

"But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar �C it wasn't supposed to do this anymore! You 
mustn't let that connection open up again �C Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!" 

When he did not reply, she gripped his arm. 

"Harry, he's taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding world! Don't 

let him inside your head too!"

Chapter Six 

The Ghoul in Pajamas 

The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the 


house in the 
days that followed. Harry kept expecting to see him 

stumping in 
through the back door like the other Order 

members, 
who passed in and out to relay news. Harry felt that 

nothing but 
action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to 
find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible. 

��Well, you can��t do anything about the�� �C Ron mouthed the word Horcruxes �C ��till you��re 
seventeen. You��ve still got the Trace on you. And we can plan here as well as anywhere, can��t we? 
Or,�� he dropped his voice to a whisper, ��d��you reckon you already know where the You-Know-
Whats are?�� 

��No,�� Harry admitted. 

��I think Hermione��s been doing a bit of research,�� said Ron. ��She said she was saving it for 
when you got here.�� 

They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just left for work. Mrs. 
Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath. 

��The Trace��ll break on the thirty-first,�� said Harry. ��That means I only need to stay here four 
days. Then I can �C�� 

��Five days,�� Ron corrected him firmly. ��We��ve got to stay for the wedding. They��ll kill us if we 
miss it.�� 

Harry understood ��they�� to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley. 

��It��s one extra day,�� said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous. 

��Don��t they realize how important �C?�� 

����Course they don��t,�� said Ron. ��They haven��t got a clue. And now you mention it, I wanted to 
talk to you about that.�� 

Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then 
leaned in closer to Harry. 

��Mum��s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we��re off to do. She��ll try you next,

��62ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin��ve both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you 
not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She��s determined.�� 

Ron��s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs. Weasley detached Harry 
from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man��s sock that she thought might have come 
out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery (area or room for washing 
dishes and performing messy tasks (British��ϴ��) off the kitchen, she started. 

��Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts,�� she 
began in a light, casual tone. 

��Oh,�� said Harry. ��Well, yeah. We are.�� 

The mangle���»� turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like one of 
Mr. Weasley��s vests. 

��May I ask why you are abandoning your education?�� said Mrs. Weasley. 

��Well, Dumbledore left me ... stuff to do,�� mumbled Harry. ��Ron and Hermione know about it, 

and they want to come too.�� 

��What sort of 'stuf��'?�� 

��I��m sorry, I can��t �C�� 

��Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I��m sure Mr. And Mrs. Granger 

would agree!�� said Mrs. Weasley. 

Harry had been afraid of the ��concerned parent�� attack. He forced himself to look directly into 
her eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny��s. This 
did not help. 

��Dumbledore didn��t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I��m sorry. Ron and Hermione 
don��t have to come, it��s their choice -�� 

��I don��t see that you have to go either!�� she snapped, dropping all pretense now. ��You��re barely 
of age, any of you! It��s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order 
at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you something 
he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you �C�� 

��I didn��t misunderstand,�� said Harry flatly. ��It��s got to be me.�� He handed her back the single 
sock he was supposed to be identifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes. ��And that��s 
not mine. I don��t support Puddlemere United.��

��63ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Oh, of course not,�� said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual 
tone. ��I should have realized. Well, Harry, while we��ve still got you here, you won��t mind helping 
with the preparations for Bill and Fleur��s wedding, will you? There��s still so much to do.�� 

��No �C I �C of course not,�� said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of subject. 

��Sweet of you,�� she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery. 

From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron and Hermione so busy with preparations 
for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think. The kindest explanation of this behavior 
would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the 
terrors of their recent journey. 

After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons and flowers, of 
de-gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canap��s, however, Harry 
started to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him, Ron, 
and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone 
since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander. 

��I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she��ll be 
able to delay you leaving,�� Ginny told Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on 
the third night of his stay. 

��And then what does she think��s going to happen?�� Harry muttered. ��Someone else might kill 

off Voldemort while she��s holding us here making vol-au-vents?�� 

He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny��s face whiten. 

��So it��s true?�� she said. ��That��s what you��re trying to do?�� 

��I �C not �C I was joking,�� said Harry evasively. 

They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny��s expression. 
Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since 
those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was remembering 
them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked 
in. 

They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the Burrow had 
replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that 
after the death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom Dumbledore had

��64ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

confided Grimmauld Place��s location had become a Secret-Keeper in turn. 

��And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm. 
Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We 
can��t expect it to hold much longer.�� 

��But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?�� asked Harry. 

��Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again. We 
hope they��ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about 
the place, but we can��t be sure. It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters 
now that its protection has become so shaky.�� 

The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks. Harry 
found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made 
him wish they had been separated by a few more people. He was trying so hard to avoid brushing 
her arm he could barely cut his chicken. 

��No news about Mad-Eye?�� Harry asked Bill. 

��Nothing,�� replied Bill. 

They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and Lupin had failed to 
recover his body. It had been difficult to know where he might have fallen, given the darkness and 
the confusion of the battle. 

��The Daily Prophet hasn��t said a word about him dying or about finding the body,�� Bill went 
on. ��But that doesn��t mean much. It��s keeping a lot quiet these days.�� 

��And they still haven��t called a hearing about all the underage magic I used escaping the Death 
Eaters?�� Harry called across the table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head. 

��Because they know I had no choice or because they don��t want me to tell the world Voldemort 
attacked me?�� 

��The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn��t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he 
is, nor that Azkaban��s seen a mass breakout.�� 

��Yeah, why tell the public the truth?�� said Harry, clenching his knife so tightly that the faint 
scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin, I must not tell lies. 

��Isn��t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?�� asked Ron angrily. 

��Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,�� Mr. Weasley replied, ��terrified that they will be next

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one 
don��t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn��t been seen for weeks 
now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day; I just hope he��s working on a 
plan.�� 

There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and 
served apple tart. 

��We must decide 'ow you will be disguised, 'Arry,�� said Fleur, once everyone had pudding. ��For 
ze wedding,�� she added, when he looked confused. ��Of course, none of our guests are Death 
Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey 'ave 'ad champagne.�� 

From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid. 

��Yes, good point,�� said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table where she sat, spectacles perched 
on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece 
of parchment. ��Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?�� 

��Why?�� exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. ��Why does my 

room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!�� 

��We are holding your brother��s wedding here in a few days�� time, young man �C�� 

��And are they getting married in my bedroom?�� asked Ron furiously. ��No! So why in the name 

of Merlin��s saggy left �C�� 

��Don��t talk to your mother like that,�� said Mr. Weasley firmly. ��And do as you��re told.�� 

Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of 

his apple tart. 

��I can help, some of it��s my mess.�� Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across him. 

��No, Harry, dear, I��d much rather you helped Arthur muck out (clean out the mud or filth (i.e. 
from a barn, mine, etc.) the chickens, and Hermione, I��d be ever so grateful if you��d change the 
sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they��re arriving at eleven tomorrow 
morning.�� 

But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens. ��There��s no need to, er, mention 
it to Molly,�� Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, ��but, er, Ted Tonks sent me 
most of what was left of Sirius��s bike and, er, I��m hiding �C that��s to say, keeping �C it in here. 
Fantastic stuff, There��s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it��s called, the most magnificent battery, and

��66ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

it��ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. I��m going to try and put it all back 
together again when Molly��s not �C I mean, when I��ve got time.�� 

When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry slipped 
upstairs to Ron��s attic bedroom. 

��I��m doing it, I��m doing �C ! Oh, it��s you,�� said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room. Ron lay 
back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was just as messy as it had 
been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy 
ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as his own, 
into two enormous piles. 

��Hi, Harry,�� she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. 

��And how did you manage to get away?�� 

��Oh, Ron��s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,�� said 

Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and The Rise and Fall of the 

Dark Arts onto the other. 

��We were just talking about Mad-Eye,�� Ron told Harry. ��I reckon he might have survived.�� 

��But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,�� said Harry. 

��Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,�� said Ron. ��How can he be sure what he saw?�� 

��Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,�� said Hermione, 

now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand. 

��He could have used a Shield Charm �C�� 

��Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,�� said Harry. 

��Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,�� said Ron grumpily, punching his pillow into a 
more comfortable shape. 

��Of course we don��t want him to be dead!�� said Hermione, looking shocked. ��It��s dreadful that 
he��s dead! But we��re being realistic!�� 

For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye��s body, broken as Dumbledore��s had been, yet with 
that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to 
laugh. 

��The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that��s why no one��s found him,�� said 
Ron wisely.

��67ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Yeah,�� said Harry. ��Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid��s front garden. 
They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him �C�� 

��Don��t!�� squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears 
over her copy of Spellman��s Syllabary. 

��Oh no,�� said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. ��Hermione, I wasn��t trying to 
upset �C�� 

But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got there first. One 
arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking 
handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he 
pointed it at the rag and said, ��Tergeo.�� 

The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, Ron handed the 
slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione. 

��Oh ... thanks, Ron... I��m sorry... �� She blew her nose and hiccupped. ��It��s just so awf-ful, isn��t 
it? R-right after Dumbledore ... I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so 
tough!�� 

��Yeah, I know,�� said Ron, giving her a squeeze. ��But you know what he��d say to us if he was 

here?�� 

����C-constant vigilance,���� said Hermione, mopping her eyes. 

��That��s right,�� said Ron, nodding. ��He��d tell us to learn from what happened to him. And what 

I��ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.�� 

Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A second later, 
Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders, she had dropped The Monster of 
Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at 
Ron��s ankle. 

��I��m sorry, I��m sorry!�� Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Ron��s leg and retied it 

shut. 

��What are you doing with all those books anyway?�� Ron asked, limping back to his bed. 

��Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,�� said Hermione, ��When we��re looking for the 
Horcruxes.�� 

��Oh, of course,�� said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. ��I forgot we��ll be hunting down

��68ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Voldemort in a mobile library.�� 

��Ha ha,�� said Hermione, looking down at Spellman��s Syllabary. ��I wonder ... will we need to 
translate runes? It��s possible... I think we��d better take it, to be safe.�� 

She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts, A History. 

��Listen,�� said Harry. He had sat up straight. 

Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance. 

��I know you said after Dumbledore��s funeral that you wanted to come with me,�� Harry began. 

��Here he goes,�� Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes. 

��As we knew he would,�� she sighed, turning back to the books. ��You know, I think I will take 

Hogwarts, A History. Even if we��re not going back there, I don��t think I��d feel right if I didn��t have 

it with �C�� 

��Listen!�� said Harry again. 

��No, Harry, you listen,�� said Hermione. ��We��re coming with you. That was decided months ago 

�C years, really.�� 
��But �C�� 
��Shut up,�� Ron advised him. 
���C are you sure you��ve thought this through?�� Harry persisted. 
��Let��s see,�� said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather 
fierce look. ��I��ve been packing for days, so we��re ready to leave at a moment��s notice, which for 
your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling MadEye��s 
whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron��s mum��s nose. 

��I��ve also modified my parents�� memories so that they��re convinced they��re really called 
Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life��s ambition is to move to Australia, which they 
have now done. That��s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate 
them about me �C or you, because unfortunately, I��ve told them quite a bit about you. 

��Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I��ll find Mum and Dad and lift the 
enchantment. If I don��t �C well, I think I��ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. 
Wendell and Monica Wilkins don��t know that they��ve got a daughter, you see.�� 

Hermione��s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put his arm around 
her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not

��69ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else 

tact. 

��I �C Hermione, I��m sorry �C I didn��t �C�� 

��Didn��t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? 

Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you��ve done.�� 

��Nah, he��s just eaten,�� said Ron. 

��Go on, he needs to know!�� 

��Oh, all right. Harry, come here.�� 

For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the 

door. 

��C��mon.�� 

��Why?�� Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing. 

��Descendo,�� muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened right over their 
heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out 
of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains. 

��That��s your ghoul, isn��t it?�� asked Harry, who had never actually met the creature that 
sometimes disrupted the nightly silence. 

��Yeah, it is,�� said Ron, climbing the ladder. ��Come and have a look at him.�� 

Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and shoulders were 

in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the 

gloom with its large mouth wide open. 

��But it ... it looks ... do ghouls normally wear pajamas?�� 

��No,�� said Ron. ��Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustulesŧ��.�� 

Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, and was 
wearing what, now that Harry��s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron��s 
pajamas. He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly 
hairy and covered in angry purple blisters. 

��He��s me, see?�� said Ron. 

��No,�� said Harry. ��I don��t.�� 

��I��ll explain it back in my room, the smell��s getting to me,�� said Ron. They climbed back down

��70ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books. 

��Once we��ve left, the ghoul��s going to come and live down here in my room,�� said Ron. ��I think 
he��s really looking forward to it �C well, it��s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool �C 
but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he��s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?�� 

Harry merely looked his confusion. 

��It is!�� said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan. ��Look, 
when we three don��t turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone��s going to think Hermione and I must be 
with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they��ve 
got information on where you are.�� 

��But hopefully it��ll look like I��ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-borns are 
talking about going into hiding at the moment,�� said Hermione. 

��We can��t hide my whole family, it��ll look too fishy and they can��t all leave their jobs,�� said 
Ron. ��So we��re going to put out the story that I��m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I 
can��t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the 
ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit��s really contagious, so they��re not going to want 
to go near him. It won��t matter that he can��t say anything, either, because apparently you can��t 
once the fungus has spread to your uvulaС��.�� 

��And your mum and dad are in on this plan?�� asked Harry. 

��Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum ... well, you��ve seen what she��s 
like. She won��t accept we��re going till we��re gone.�� 

There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione continued to throw 
books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other, 
unable to say anything. The measure they had taken to protect their families made him realize, 
more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with him and that 
they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, 
but he simply could not find words important enough. 

Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four floors below. 

��Ginny��s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,�� said Ron. ��I dunno why the 
Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.�� 

��Fleur��s sister��s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she��s too young to

��71ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

come on her own,�� said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee. 

��Well, guests aren��t going to help Mum��s stress levels,�� said Ron. 

��What we really need to decide,�� said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin 
without a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, ��is where 
we��re going after we leave here. I know you said you wanted to go to Godric��s Hollow first, Harry, 
and I understand why, but ... well ... shouldn��t we make the Horcruxes our priority?�� 

��If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I��d agree with you,�� said Harry, who did not 
believe that Hermione really understood his desire to return to Godric��s Hollow. His parents�� 
graves were only part of the attraction, He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place 
held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemort��s 
Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the 
place where it had happened, wanting to understand. 

��Don��t you think there��s a possibility that Voldemort��s keeping a watch on Godric��s Hollow?�� 
Hermione asked. ��He might expect you to go back and visit your parents�� graves once you��re free 
to go wherever you like?�� 

This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a counterargument, Ron spoke up, 

evidently following his own train of thought. 

��This R.A.B. person,�� he said. ��You know, the one who stole the real locket?�� 

Hermione nodded. 

��He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn��t he?�� 

Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.��s note 

was still folded. 

����I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.���� Harry read out. 

��Well, what if he did finish it off?�� said Ron. 

��Or she.�� Interposed Hermione. 

��Whichever,�� said Ron. ��it��d be one less for us to do!�� 

��Yes, but we��re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren��t we?�� said Hermione, 

��to find out whether or not it��s destroyed.�� 

��And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?�� asked Ron. 

��Well,�� said Hermione, ��I��ve been researching that.��

��72ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��How?�� asked Harry. ��I didn��t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library?�� 

��There weren��t,�� said Hermione, who had turned pink. ��Dumbledore removed them all, but he �C 
he didn��t destroy them.�� 

Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed. ��How in the name of Merlin��s pants have you managed to get 
your hands on those Horcrux books?�� 

��It �C it wasn��t stealing!�� said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. 
��They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he 
really didn��t want anyone to get at them, I��m sure he would have made it much harder to �C�� 

��Get to the point!�� said Ron. 

��Well ... it was easy,�� said Hermione in a small voice. ��I just did a Summoning Charm. You 
know �C Accio. And �C they zoomed out of Dumbledore��s study window right into the girls�� 
dormitory.�� 

��But when did you do this?�� Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and 
incredulity. 

��Just after his �C Dumbledore��s �C funeral,�� said Hermione in an even smaller voice. ��Right after 
we agreed we��d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get 
my things it ... it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be ... 
and I was alone in there ... so I tried ... and it worked. They flew straight in through the open 
window and I �C I packed them.�� 

She swallowed and then said imploringly, ��I can��t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, 

it��s not as though we��re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?�� 

��Can you hear us complaining?�� said Ron. ��Where are these books anyway?�� 

Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume, bound in 
faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something 
recently dead. 

��This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the 
Darkest Art �C it��s a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore 
removed it from the library... if he didn��t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the 
instruction he needed from here.�� 

��Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he��d already read that?��

��73ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

asked Ron. 

��He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,�� 
said Harry. ��Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he 
asked Slughorn about them. I think you��re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he 
got the information.�� 

��And the more I��ve read about them,�� said Hermione, ��the more horrible they seem, and the less 
I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of 
your soul by ripping it, and that��s just by making one Horcrux!�� 

Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond ��usual evil.�� 

��Isn��t there any way of putting yourself back together?�� Ron asked. 

��Yes,�� said Hermione with a hollow smile, ��but it would be excruciatingly painful.�� 

��Why? How do you do it?�� asked Harry. 

��Remorse,�� said Hermione. ��You��ve got to really feel what you��ve done. There��s a footnote. 
Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can��t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?�� 

��No,�� said Ron, before Harry could answer. ��So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that 
book?�� 

��Yes,�� said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, ��because it 
warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I��ve 
read, what Harry did to Riddle��s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a 
Horcrux.�� 

��What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?�� asked Harry. 

��Oh well, lucky we��ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,�� said Ron. ��I was 
wondering what we were going to do with them.�� 

��It doesn��t have to be a basilisk fang,�� said Hermione patiently. ��It has to be something so 
destructive that the Horcrux can��t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it��s 
incredibly rare �C�� 

���C phoenix tears,�� said Harry, nodding. 

��Exactly,�� said Hermione. ��Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as 
basilisk venom, and they��re all dangerous to carry around with you. That��s a problem we��re going 
to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won��t do the trick.

��74ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

You��ve got to put it beyond magical repair.�� 

��But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,�� said Ron, ��why can��t the bit of soul in it just go and 
live in something else?�� 

��Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.�� 

Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. ��Look, if I picked 

up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn��t damage your soul at all.�� 

��Which would be a real comfort to me, I��m sure,�� said Ron. 

Harry laughed. 

��It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will 
survive, untouched,�� said Hermione. ��But it��s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment 
of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can��t exist without it.�� 

��That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,�� said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood 
from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort��s soul as it vanished. 

��And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. 
Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back 
good as new.�� 

��Hang on,�� said Ron, frowning. ��The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn��t it? 
How does that work, then?�� 

��While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone 
if they get too close to the object. I don��t mean holding it for too long, it��s nothing to do with 
touching it,�� she added before Ron could speak. ��I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her 
heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You��re in trouble if you get too 
fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.�� 

��I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?�� said Harry. ��Why didn��t I ask him? I never 
really ...�� 

His voice trailed away, He was thinking of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore, and 
of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many 
opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more ... to find out everything ... 

The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking crash. Hermione 
shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing

��75ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and 
smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing 
that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted 
with rage. 

��I��m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,�� she said, her voice trembling. ��I��m sure you 
all need your rest ... but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I 
was under the impression that you had agreed to help.�� 

��Oh yes,�� said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet, sending books flying in every 
direction. ��we will ... we��re sorry ...�� 

With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after Mrs. 
Weasley. 

��It��s like being a house-elf,�� complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his head as he and 
Harry followed. ��Except without the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding��s over, the happier 
I��ll be.�� 

��Yeah,�� said Harry, ��then we��ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes... It��ll be like a 
holiday, won��t it?�� 

Ron started to laugh, but, at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them 
in Mrs. Weasley��s room, stopped quite abruptly. 

The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o�� clock. Harry, Ron, Hermione and 
Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur��s family by this time; and it was with ill grace that 
Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his hair. Once 
they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the 
visitors. 

Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots 
that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes 
standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, 
giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and 
the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked 
it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent (group) 
of capering gnomes.

��76ҳ��

He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the Burrow by both 
the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by 
magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a 
nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an 
unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at 
the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf 
green robes, who could be Fleur��s mother. 

��Mama!�� cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. ��Papa!�� 

Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head shorter and 
extremely plump, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing 
towards Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her 
flustered. 

��You 'ave been so much trouble,�� he said in a deep voice. ��Fleur tells us you 'ave been working 

very 'ard.�� 

��Oh, it��s been nothing, nothing!�� trilled Mrs. Weasley. ��No trouble at all!�� 

Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of 

the new Flutterby bushes. 

��Dear lady!�� said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley��s hand between his own two 
plump ones and beaming. ��We are most honored at the approaching union of our two families! Let 
me present my wife, Apolline.�� 

Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too. 

��Enchant��e,�� she said. ��Your 'usband 'as been telling us such amusing stories!�� 

Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look, upon which he became 
immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend. 

��And, of course, you 'ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!�� said Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle 
was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave 
Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her 
eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly. 

��Well, come in, do!�� said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours into the house, 
with many "No, please!"s and "After you! "s and "Not at all!"s. 

��77ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were pleased with 
everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour 
pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids�� shoes ��Charmant!�� Madame 
Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice 
(quickly, immediately); Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she 
could and jabbering away in rapid French. 

On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame 
Delacour��s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in 
Percy��s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from 
Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in 
desperation that Harry, Ron and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape 
the overcrowded house. 

��But she still won��t leave us alone!�� snarled Ron, and their second attempt at a meeting in the 
yard was foiled (frustrate) by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in 
her arms. 

��Oh, good, you��ve fed the chickens,�� she called as she approached them. ��We��d better shut them 
away again before the men arrive tomorrow ... to put up the tent for the wedding,�� she explained, 
pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. ��Millamant��s Magic Marquees����
Ļ;���� ... they��re very good. Bill��s escorting them... You��d better stay inside while they��re here, 
Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these security spells around 
the place.�� 

��I��m sorry,�� said Harry humbly. 

��Oh, don��t be silly, dear!�� said Mrs. Weasley at once. ��I didn��t mean �C well, your safety��s much 
more important! Actually, I��ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, 
Harry. Seventeen, after all, it��s an important day... " 

��I don��t want a fuss,�� said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional strain this would put on 
them all. ��Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine... It��s the day before the 
wedding... �� 

��Oh, well, if you��re sure, dear. I��ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid?��

��78ҳ��

��That��d be great,�� said Harry. ��But please, don��t go to loads of trouble.�� 

��Not at all, not at all ... It��s no trouble... �� 

She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened up, and walked 
away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into 
the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience 
and the pain he was giving her.

Chapter Seven 
The Will of Albus Dumbledore 


He was walking along a mountain road in the 


cool blue light 
of dawn. Far below, swathed (wrap, envelop) in 

mist, was the 
shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought 

down there, the 
man he needed so badly he could think of little 

else, the man 
who held the answer, the answer to his problem... 

? 
"Oi, wake up." 
Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on 


the camp bed in 
Ron's dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was 
asleep with his head under his tiny wing. The scar on Harry's forehead was prickling. 

"You were muttering in your sleep." 

"Was I?" 

"Yeah. 'Gregorovitch.' You kept saying 'Gregorovitch.'" 

Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron's face appeared slightly blurred. 

"Who's Gregorovitch?" 

"I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it." 

Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name before, but he 
could not think where. 

"I think Voldemort's looking for him." 

"Poor bloke," said Ron fervently. 

Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember exactly what he had 

seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little 

village cradled in a deep valley. 

"I think he's abroad." 

"Who, Gregorovitch?" 

"Voldemort. I think he's somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn't look like 
anywhere in Britain." 

"You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?" Ron sounded worried.

��80ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Do me a favor and don't tell Hermione," said Harry. "Although how she expects me to stop 

seeing stuff in my sleep...�� 

He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon's cage, thinking... Why was the name "Gregorovitch" familiar? 

"I think," he said slowly, "he's got something to do with Quidditch. There's some connection, 

but I can't... I can't think what it is." 

"Quidditch?" said Ron. "Sure you're not thinking of Gorgovitch?" 

"Who?" 

"Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years 

ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season." 

"No," said Harry. "I'm definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch." 

"I try not to either," said Ron. "Well, happy birthday anyway." 

"Wow, that's right, I forgot! I'm seventeen!" 

Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had 
left his glasses, and said, "Accio Glasses!" Although they were only around a foot away, there was 
something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, at least until they poked him 
in the eye. 

"Slick," snorted Ron. 

Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron's possessions flying around the room, 
causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry also tried tying the 
laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely 
for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron's Chudley Cannons posters bright blue. 

"I'd do your fly by hand, though," Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry immediately 
checked it. "Here's your present. Unwrap it up here, it's not for my mother's eyes." 

"A book?" said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. "Bit of a departure from tradition, isn't 
it?" 

"This isn't your average book," said Ron. "It'd pure gold, Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm 
Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I'd had this last year I'd have 
known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would've known how to get going with... Well, 
Fred and George gave me a copy, and I've learned a lot. You'd be surprised, it's not all about 
wandwork, either."

When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. Bill and 
Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them 
over the frying pan. 

"Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry," said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. 
"He had to leave early for work, but he'll be back for dinner. That's our present on top." 

Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. Inside was a watch 
very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars 
circling around the face instead of hands. 

"It's traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age," said Mrs. Weasley, watching 
him anxiously from beside the cooker. "I'm afraid that one isn't new like Ron's, it was actually my 
brother Fabian's and he wasn't terribly careful with his possessions, it's a bit dented on the back, 
but-" 

The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put a lot of unsaid 
things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted his cheek clumsily when 
he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to 
flop out of the frying pan onto the floor. 

"Happy birthday, Harry!" said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present 
to the top of the pile. "It's not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?" she added to 
Ron, who seemed not to hear her. 

"Come on, then, open Hermione's!" said Ron. 

She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an enchanted razor from 
Bill and Fleur ("Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever 'ave," Monsieur 
Delacour assured him, "but you must tell it clearly what you want... ozzerwise you might find you 
'ave a leetle less hair zan you would like...��), chocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box 
of the latest Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, 
and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. 

"I'll pack these for you," Hermione said brightly, taking Harry's presents out of his arms as the 
three of them headed back upstairs. "I'm nearly done, I'm just waiting for the rest of your 
underpants to come out of the wash, Ron -" 

��82ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Ron's splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing. 

"Harry, will you come in here a moment?" 

It was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him 
on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room. 

He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large poster of the 
Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-
witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window, 
which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played a two-a-side Quidditch 
with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on 
top was level with Ginny's window. 

Ginny looked up into Harry's face, took a deep breath, and said, "Happy seventeenth." 

"Yeah... thanks." 

She was looking at him steadily; he however, found it difficult to look back at her; it was like 
gazing into a brilliant light. 

"Nice view," he said feebly, pointing toward with window. 

She ignored this. He could not blame her. 

"I couldn't think what to get you," she said. 

"You didn't have to get me anything." 

She disregarded this too. "I didn't know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you 

wouldn't be able to take it with you." 

He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things 
about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have 
toughened her up. 

She took a step closer to him. 

"So then I thought, I'd like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet 
some veela when you're off doing whatever you're doing." 

"I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest." 

"There's the silver lining (ʧ�������е� )һ��ϣ�� /ο�壩 I've been looking for," she 
whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was 
kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in

the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair-

The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. 

"Oh," said Ron pointedly. "Sorry." 

"Ron!" Hermione was just behind him, slight out of breath. There was a strained silence, then 

Ginny had said in a flat little voice, "Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry." 

Ron's ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, 
but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened, and his shining 
moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for 
staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy 
forgetfulness was gone. 

He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but she had turned 
her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do 
anything to comfort her in front of Ron. 

"I'll see you later," he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. 

Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and Harry kept 
pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking scared. 

Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry. 

"You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?" 

"I'm not messing her around," said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them. 

"Ron-" 

But Ron held up a hand to silence her. 

"She was really cut up when you ended it -" 

"So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn't because I wanted to." 

"Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she's just going to get her hopes up again-" 

"She's not an idiot, she knows it can't happen, she's not expecting us to... to end up married, or -" 

As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry's mind of Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, 
faceless, and unpleasant stranger. 

In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him, her future was free and unencumbered, whereas 
his... he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead. 

"If you keep groping her every chance you get -" 

��84ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"It won't happen again," said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as though the sun 
had gone in. "Okay?" 

Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a 
moment, then said, "Right then, well, that's... yeah." 

Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, nor by any 
look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. 
Nevertheless, Charlie's arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. 
Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about 
to get a proper haircut. 

As Harry's birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow's kitchen to breaking point even 
before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in 
the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns all emblazoned with a large 
number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley's ministrations, George's 
wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head, 
despite the twins' many jokes about it. 

Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves 
artistically over the trees and bushes. 

"Nice," said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the 
crabapple tree to gold. "You've really got an eye for that sort of thing." 

"Thank you, Ron!" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry turned 
away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments 
when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; he caught 
Ginny's eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a 
conversation with Monsieur Delacour. 

"Out of the way, out of the way!" sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate with what 
appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realized 
that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk 
carrying it over the uneven ground. 

When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, "That looks amazing, 
Mrs. Weasley."

"Oh, it's nothing, dear," she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and 
mouthed, Good one. 

By seven o'clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had 
waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best, and 
horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry's hand, Harry thought he 
looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant. 

"Happy birthday, Harry," she said, hugging him tightly. 

"Seventeen, eh!" said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from Fred. "Six years 
ter the day since we met, Harry, d'yeh remember it?" 

"Vaguely," said Harry, grinning up at him. "Didn't you smash down the front door, give Dudley 
a pig's tail, and tell me I was a wizard?" 

"I forge' the details," Hagrid chortled. "All righ', Ron, Hermione?" 

"We're fine," said Hermione. "How are you?" 

"Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns. I'll show yeh when yeh get back -" 
Harry avoided Ron's and Hermione's gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. "Here. Harry, 
couldn't think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this." He pulled out a small, slightly furry 
drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. "Mokeskin. 
Hide anythin' in there an' no one but the owner can get it out. They're rare, them." 

"Hagrid, thanks!" 

"'S'nothin'," said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. "An' there's Charlie! Always 
liked him. Hey! Charlie!" 

Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, brutally short haircut. He 
was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his muscled arms. 

"Hi, Hagrid, how's it going?" 

"Bin meanin' ter write fer ages. How's Norbert doin'?" 

"Norbert?" Charlie laughed. "The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Norberta now." 

"Wha, Norbert's a girl?" 

"Oh yeah," said Charlie. 

"How can you tell?" asked Hermione. 

"They're a lot more vicious," said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice.

"Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum's getting edgy." 

They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while 
glancing repeatedly at the gate. 

"I think we'd better start without Arthur," she called to the garden at large after a moment or 
two. "He must have been held up at... oh!" 

They all saw it at the same time, a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the 
table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke 
with Mr. Weasley's voice. 

"Minister of Magic coming with me." 

The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur's family peering in astonishment at the place 
where it had vanished. 

"We shouldn't be here," said Lupin at once. "Harry, I'm sorry, I'll explain some other time." 

He seized Tonks��s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence, climbed over it, and 

vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. 

"The Minister, but why? I don't understand -" 

But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of 
thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of 
grizzled hair. 

The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern-lit table, where 
everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the 
lantern light. Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy������ 
and grim. 

"Sorry to intrude," said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. "Especially as I can 

see that I am gate-crashing a party." 

His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. "Many happy returns." 

"Thanks," said Harry. 

"I require a private word with you," Scrimgeour went on. "Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and 

Miss Hermione Granger." 

"Us?" said Ron, sounding surprised. "Why us?" 

"I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private," said Scrimgeour. "Is there such a

��87ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

place?" he demanded of Mr. Weasley. 

"Yes, of course," said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. "The, er, sitting room, why don't you 
use that?" 

"You can lead the way," Scrimgeour said to Ron. "There will be no need for you to accompany 
us, Arthur." 

Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, and Hermione 
stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two were 
thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were 
planning to drop out of Hogwarts. 

Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into the Burrow's 
sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in 
here; Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but 
cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, 
leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. 

Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke. "I have some questions for the three of you, and I 
think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two" -he pointed at Harry and Hermione -"can 
wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald." 

"We're not going anywhere," said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. "You can speak to 
us together, or not at all." 

Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that the Minister was 
wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early. 

"Very well then, together," he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. "I am here, as I'm sure you 
know, because of Albus Dumbledore's will." 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. 

"A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you anything?" 

"A-all of us?" said Ron, "Me and Hermione too?" 

"Yes, all of -" 

But Harry interrupted. "Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give 
us what he left us?" 

"Isn't it obvious?" said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. "They wanted to examine

��88ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

whatever he's left us. You had no right to do that!" she said, and her voice trembled slightly. 

"I had every right," said Scrimgeour dismissively. "The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation 
gives the Ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a will -" 

"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts," said Hermione, "and the 
Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions are illegal before 
seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something 
cursed?" 

"Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?" asked Scrimgeour. 

"No, I'm not," retorted Hermione. "I'm hoping to do some good in the world!" 

Ron laughed. Scrimgeour's eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry spoke. 

"So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can't think of a pretext to keep them?" 

"No, it'll be because thirty-one days are up," said Hermione at once. "They can't keep the objects 
longer than that unless they can prove they're dangerous. Right?" 

"Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?" asked Scrimgeour, ignoring 

Hermione. 

Ron looked startled. "Me? Not, not really... It was always Harry who...�� 

Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-talking-now! sort 
of look, but the damage was done. 

Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. 
He swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron's answer. 

"If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered 
you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions 
-his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects 
(personal property, private 
belongings) - were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?" 

"I... dunno," said Ron. "I... when I say we weren't close... I mean, I think he liked me..." 

"You're being modest, Ron," said Hermione. "Dumbledore was very fond of you." 

This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had 
never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been negligible. 

However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew 
out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a

��89ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud. 

"'The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore'... Yes, here we 
are... 'To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me 
when he uses it.'" 

Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before, it looked something like a 
silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, 
with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it 
and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned. 

"That is a valuable object," said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. "It may even be unique. Certainly it 

is of Dumbledore's own design. Why would he have left you an item so rare?" 

Ron shook his head, looking bewildered. 

"Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students," Scrimgeour persevered. "Yet the only 

ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put 

to the Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?" 

"Put out lights, I s'pose," mumbled Ron. "What else could I do with it?" 

Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or two, he 
turned back to Dumbledore's will. 

"'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope 
that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'" 

Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets 
of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its bindingװ�� was stained and peeling in places. Hermione took it 
from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the 
title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the 
embossed symbols. 

"Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?" asked Scrimgeour. 

"He... he knew I liked books," said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve. 

"But why that particular book?" 

"I don't know. He must have thought I'd enjoy it." 

"Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with Dumbledore?" 

"No, I didn't," said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. "And if the Ministry hasn't

��90ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will." 

She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had difficulty extracting 
his arm to put it around Hermione's shoulders. Scrimgeour turned back to the will. 

"'To Harry James Potter,'" he read, and Harry's insides contracted with a sudden excitement, "'I 
leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards 
of perseverance and skill.'" 

As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather 

feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax����ɨ�˵Ľ�β. 

"Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?" asked Scrimgeour. 

"No idea," said Harry. "For the reasons you just read out, I suppose... to remind me what you 

can get if you... persevere and whatever it was." 

"You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?" 

"I suppose so," said Harry. "What else could it be?" 

"I'm asking the questions," said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk 
was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the 
hedge. 

"I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch," Scrimgeour said to Harry. "Why is 
that?" 

Hermione laughed derisively. "Oh, it can't be a reference to the fact Harry's a great Seeker, that's 
way too obvious," she said. "There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the 
icing!" 

"I don't think there's anything hidden in the icing," said Scrimgeour, "but a Snitch would be a 

very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I'm sure?" 

Harry shrugged. 

Hermione, however, answered. 

Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could 

not suppress the urge. 

"Because Snitches have flesh memories," she said. 

"What?" said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione's Quidditch knowledge 

negligible.

��91ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Correct," said Scrimgeour. "A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released, not even 
by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human 
to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch" -he held up the tiny golden ball "
will remember your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical 
skill whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you." 

Harry's heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How could he 
avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister? 

"You don't say anything," said Scrimgeour. "Perhaps you already know what the Snitch 
contains?" 

"No," said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing 
so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione's mind; he could 
practically hear her brain whizzing beside him. 

"Take it," said Scrimgeour quietly. 

Harry met the Minister's yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He held out his 
hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and place the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into 
Harry's palm. 

Nothing happened. As Harry's fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and 
were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed 
ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way. 

"That was dramatic," said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laughed. 

"That's all, then, is it?" asked Hermione, making to raise herself off the sofa. 

"Not quite," said Scrimgeour, who looked bad tempered now. "Dumbledore left you a second 
bequest, Potter." 

"What is it?" asked Harry, excitement rekindling. 

Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time. 

"The sword of Godric Gryffindor," he said. 

Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but 
Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too 
small to contain it. 

"So where is it?" Harry asked suspiciously.

��92ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Unfortunately," said Scrimgeour, "that sword was not Dumbledore's to give away. The sword 
of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, belongs -" 

"It belongs to Harry!" said Hermione hotly. "It chose him, he was the one who found it, it came 
to him out of the Sorting Hat -" 

"According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any worthy 
Gryffindor," said Scrimgeour. "That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, 
whatever Dumbledore may have decided." Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, 
scrutinizing Harry. "Why do you think -?" 

"-Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?" said Harry, struggling to keep his temper. "Maybe 
he thought it would look nice on my wall." 

"This is not a joke, Potter!" growled Scrimgeour. "Was it because Dumbledore believed that 
only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you 
that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy HeWho-
Must-Not-Be-Named?" 

"Interesting theory," said Harry. "Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe 
the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down 
Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So this is what you've been doing, Minister, 
shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying �C I was nearly one of them 

�C Voldemort chased me across three counties, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there's no word 
about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!" 
"You go too far!" shouted Scrimgeour, standing up, Harry jumped to his feet too. Scrimgeour 
limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand; it singed a hole 
in Harry's T-shirt like a lit cigarette. 

"Oi!" said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said, "No! D'you want to give 
him an excuse to arrest us?" 

"Remembered you're not at school, have you?" said Scrimgeour breathing hard into Harry's 
face. "Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? 
You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me 
how to do my job! It's time you learned some respect!" 

"It's time you earned it." said Harry.

��93ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the sitting room 
burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in. 

"We... we thought we heard -" began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of 
Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose. 

"- raised voices," panted Mrs. Weasley. 

Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had made in Harry's 
T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper. 

"It �C it was nothing," he growled. "I ... regret your attitude," he said, looking Harry full in the 
face once more. "You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you �C what Dumbledore 

�C desired. We ought to work together." 
"I don't like your methods, Minister," said Harry. "Remember?" 
For the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scar that still 
showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies . Scrimgeour's expression hardened. He 
turned away without another word and limped from the room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; 
Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so she called, "He's gone!" 

"What did he want?" Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. 
Weasley came hurrying back to them. 

"To give us what Dumbledore left us," said Harry. "They've only just released the content of his 
will." 

Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had given them were 
passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the 
Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them 
could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. 
Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, 
"Harry, dear, everyone's awfully hungry we didn't like to start without you... Shall I serve dinner 
now?" 

They all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of "Happy Birthday" and much 
gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but 
was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a 
neighboring field.

��94ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Meet us upstairs," Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the 
garden to its normal state. "After everyone's gone to bed." 

Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid's mokeskin purse, 
not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them 
were, the Marauder's Map, the shard of Sirius's enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.'s locket. He pulled 
the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching 
its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside. 

"Muffiato," she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs. 

"Thought you didn't approve of that spell?" said Ron. 

"Times change," said Hermione. "Now, show us that Deluminator." 

Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit 
went out at once. 

"The thing is," whispered Hermione through the dark, "we could have achieved that with 
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder." 

There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and 
illuminated them all once more. 

"Still, it's cool," said Ron, a little defensively. "And from what they said, Dumbledore invented 
it himself!" 

"I know, but, surely he wouldn't have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the 
lights!" 

"D'you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he'd left 
us?" asked Harry. 

"Definitely," said Hermione. "He couldn't tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, 
but that will doesn't explain -�� 

"- why he couldn't have given us a hint when he was alive?" asked Ron. 

"Well, exactly," said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the Bard. "If these 
things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you'd think he'd have 
left us know why... unless he thought it was obvious?" 

"Thought wrong, then, didn't he?" said Ron. "I always said he was mental. Brilliant and 
everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch �C what the hell was that about?" 

��95ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I've no idea," said Hermione. "When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that 
something was going to happen!" 

"Yeah, well," said Harry, his pulse quickened as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. "I wasn't 
going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?" 

"What do you mean?" asked Hermione. 

"The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?" said Harry. "Don't you remember?" 

Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically from Harry to the 

Snitch and back again until he found his voice. "That was the one you nearly swallowed!" 

"Exactly," said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch. 

It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him, He lowered the 

golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out. 

"Writing! There's writing on it, quick, look!" He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and 
excitement. Hermione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds 
before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanted handwriting that Harry 
recognized as Dumbledore's: 

I open at the close. 

He had barely read them when the words vanished again. 

"'I open at the close...' What's that supposed to mean?" 

Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank. 

"I open at the close... at the close... I open at the close...�� 

But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, they were 
unable to wring any more meaning from them. 

"And the sword," said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divineռ

��;�Ʋ� meaning in the Snitch's inscription. 

"Why did he want Harry to have the sword?" 

"And why couldn't he just have told me?" Harry said quietly. "I was there, it was right there on 
the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn't he just 
give it to me then?" 

He felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able 
to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there something he had missed in

��96ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore 
expected him to understand? 

"And as for this book." Said Hermione, "The Tales of Beedle the Bard ... I've never even heard 
of them!" 

"You've never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?" said Ron incredulously. "You're kidding, 
right?" 

"No, I'm not," said Hermione in surprise. "Do you know them then?" 

"Well, of course I do!" 

Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not 

was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise. 

"Oh come on! All the old kids' stories are supposed to be Beedle's aren't they? 'The Fountain of 
Fair Fortune' ... 'The Wizard and the Hopping Pot'... 'Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling 
Stump'..." 

"Excuse me?" said Hermione giggling. "What was the last one?" 

"Come off it!" said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione. "You must've heard of 
Babbitty Rabbitty �C" 

"Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!" said Hermione. "We didn't 
hear stories like that when we were little, we heard 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves' and 
'Cinderella' �C" 

"What's that, an illness?" asked Ron. 

"So these are children's stories?" asked Hermione, bending against over the runes. 

"Yeah." Said Ron uncertainly. "I mean, just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories 
came from Beedle. I dunno what they're like in the original versions." 

"But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?" 

Something cracked downstairs. 

"Probably just Charlie, now Mum's asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair," said Ron nervously. 

"All the same, we should get to bed," whispered Hermione. "It wouldn't do to oversleep 
tomorrow." 

"No," agreed Ron. "A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom's mother might put a bit of damper 
on the wedding. I'll get the light."

And he clicked the Deluminator once more as Hermione left the room.

Chapter Eight 

The Wedding 

Three o��clock on the following afternoon found 


Harry, 
Ron, Fred and George standing outside the great white 

marquee 
in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding 

guests. 
Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and 

was now 
the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local 

village, 
Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a 

Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as ��Cousin Barny�� and trust to the great 
number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him. 

All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right 
seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden jacketed band, 
and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree. Harry could see a 
blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed 
rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting 
poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous 
bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband 
and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry 
was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting��װ was slightly 
fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer��s day. 

��When I get married,�� said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, ��I won��t be bothering 
with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I��ll put a full Body Bind Curse on 
Mum until it��s all over.�� 

��She wasn��t too bad this morning, considering,�� said George. ��Cried a bit about Percy not 
being here, but who wants him. Oh blimey, brace yourselves, here they come, look.�� 

Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of 
the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through the 
garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches�� hats, 
while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards�� cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew

louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent. 

��Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,�� said George, craning his neck for a better look. 
��They��ll need help understanding our English customs, I��ll look after them.�� 

��Not so fast, Your Holeyness,�� said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches 
heading for the procession, he said, ��Here �C permetiez moi to assister vous,�� to a pair of pretty 
French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George was left to deal with the 
middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley��s old Ministry-colleague Perkins, while 
a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry��s lot. 

��Wotcher,�� said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and 
Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. ��Arthur told us you were 
the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,�� she added in a whisper as Harry led them up 
the aisle. ��The Ministry��s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence 
might not do you any favors.�� 

��It��s fine, I understand,�� said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a 
swift smile, but as they turned away Harry saw Lupin��s face fall again into lines of misery. He did 
not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter. Hagrid was causing a certain 
amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred��s directions as he had sat himself, not upon the 
magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five sets that now 
resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks. 

While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would 
listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking 
wizard. Slightly cross-eyedб�ӵ�;�����۵�, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candy 
floss (British) cotton candy, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of 
an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened 
from a golden chain around his neck. 

��Xenophilius Lovegood,�� he said, extending a hand to Harry, ��my daughter and I live just over 
the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?�� he added to 
Ron. 

 ��Yes,�� said Ron. ��Isn��t she with you?�� 

��She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious

��100ҳ��

infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes �C or, 
to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.�� 

��Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,�� said Ron, ��but I think Fred and George taught 
them those.��

 He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. 

 ��Hello, Harry!�� she said. 

 ��Er �C my name��s Barry,�� said Harry, flummoxed. (Slang) confuse

 ��Oh, have you changed that too?�� she asked brightly.

 ��How did you know -?��

 ��Oh, just your expression,�� she said. 

Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had accessorized with a large 
sunflower in her hair. Once you get over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite 
pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears. 

Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange 
between Luna and Harry. Biding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her 
finger and said, ��Daddy, look �C one of the gnomes actually bit me.�� 

��How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial.�� Said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna��s 
outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks. ��Luna, my love, if you should 
feel any burgeoning��ѿ talent today �C perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims 
in Mermish �C do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!��

 Ron, passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort. 

��Ron can laugh,�� said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, ��but 
my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.�� 

��Really?�� said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father��s peculiar 
views. ��Are you sure you don��t want to put anything on that bite, though?�� 

��Oh, it��s fine,�� said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and 
down. ��You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he 
believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.�� 

As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm. Her 
beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo

���. 

��... and your hair��s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin��s 
beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?�� she 
barked at Harry.

 ��Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.�� 

��Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn��t Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. 
I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?��

 ��No �C he couldn��t come �C�� 

��Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I��ve 
just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,�� she shouted at Harry. ��Goblin-made, 
you know, and been in my family for centuries. She��s a good-looking girl, but still �C French. Well, 
well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too 
long.�� 

Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time. When next 
they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The Marquee was 
nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside. 

��Nightmare, Muriel is,�� said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. ��She used to come for 
Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a 
Dungbomb under her chair at diner. Dad always says she��ll have written them out of her will �C like 
they care, they��re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they��re going... Wow,�� he 
added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. ��You look great!�� 

��Always the tone of surprise,�� said Hermione, though she smiled. She was wearing a floaty, 
lilac�϶��� ,����ɫ -colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. ��Your 
Great-Aunt Muriel doesn��t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She 
said, 'Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?' and then, 'Bad posture and skinny ankles.'��

 ��Don��t take it personally, she��s rude to everyone,�� said Ron. 

��Talking about Muriel?�� inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred. ��Yeah, 
she��s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; 
he was a right laugh at weddings.��

 ��Wasn��t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?�� asked Hermione.

��102ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,�� conceded George. 

��But before he went loopy (crazy) he was the life and soul of the party,�� said Fred. ��He used to 
down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start 
pulling bunches of flowers out of his �C��

 ��Yes, he sounds a real charmer,�� said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter.

 ��Never married, for some reason,�� said Ron. 

 ��You amaze me,�� said Hermione. 

They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young 
man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and 
said, with his eyes on Hermione, ��You look vunderful.�� 

��Viktor!�� she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite 
disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said ��I didn��t know you 
were �C goodness �C it��s lovely to see �C how are you?�� 

Ron��s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum��s invitation as if he did not 

believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, ��how come you��re here?��

 ��Fleur invited me,�� said Krum, eyebrows raised. 

Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then feeling that it would be prudent to 
remove Krum from Ron��s vicinity, offered to show him his seat. 

��Your friend is not pleased to see me,�� said Krum, as they entered the now packed marquee. 
��Or is he a relative?�� he added with a glance at Harry��s red curly hair.

 ��Cousin.�� Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appearance was causing a stir, 
particularly amongst the veela cousins, He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people 
were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came 
hurrying down the aisle.

 ��Time to sit down,�� Fred told Harry, ��or we��re going to get run over by the bride.�� 

Harry, Ron and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George. 
Hermione looked rather pink and Ron��s ears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to 
Harry, ��Did you see he��s grown a stupid little beard?��

 Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. 

A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring broken by

��103ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and 
waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst��ˮ�� , colored robes 
with a matching hat. 

A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, 
with larger white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of 
giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to 
be the golden balloons. 

 ��Ooooh!�� said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. 

A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour 
and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. 
Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. 
While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it 
fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual and 
once Fleur had reached for him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrit Greyback. 

��Ladies and gentlemen,�� said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, Harry saw the 
same small, tufty-hired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore��s funeral, now standing in front of 
Bill and Fleur. ��We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls...�� 

��Yes, my tiara set off the whole thing nicely,�� said Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. 
��But I must say, Ginevra��s dress is far too low cut.�� 

Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry��s 
mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to the afternoons spent alone with Ginny in 
lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to 
be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person��s life, a person without 
a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead... . 

 ��Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle ...?�� 

In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of 
lace. Trumpet-like sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out 
one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned around and beamed at Harry; her 
eyes too were full of tears. 

 ��... then I declare you bonded for life.��

��104ҳ��

The tufty-haired wizard waved his hand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of 
silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a 
round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst. Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew 
and floated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din. 

 ��Ladies and gentlemen!�� called the tufty-haired wizard. ��If you would please stand up!�� 

They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The seats on 
which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee 
vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of 
the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center 
of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small, 
white-clothed tables, which all floated gracefully back to earth round it, and the golden-jacketed 
band trooped toward a podium. 

��Smooth,�� said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some bearing silver 
trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches. 

��We should go and congratulate them!�� said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place 
where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers. 

��We��ll have time later,�� shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and 
handing one to Harry. ��Hermione, cop hold (take hold of, look at), let��s grab a table... Not there! 
Nowhere near Muriel �C��

 Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went; Harry felt sure 
that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the 
marquee, most of the tables were occupied, The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone.

 ��All right if we join you?�� asked Ron. 

 ��Oh yes,�� she said happily. ��Daddy��s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.��

 ��What is it, a lifetime��s supply of Gurdyroots?�� asked Ron. 

Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, 
Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. 

The band had begun to play, Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after 
a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur��s 
father.

��105ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I like this song,�� said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she 
stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed 
and waving her arms.

 ��She��s great, isn��t she?�� said Ron admiringly. ��Always good value.��

 But the smile vanished from his face at once, Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna��s vacant seat. 
Hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With 
a scowl on his face he said, ��Who is that man in the yellow?�� 

��That��s Xenophilius Lovegood, he��s the father of a friend of ours,�� said Ron. His pugnacious 
tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. 
��Come and dance,�� he added abruptly to Hermione. 

She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into the growing 

throng on the dance floor. 

 ��Ah, they are together now?�� asked Krum, momentarily distracted.

 ��Er �C sort of,�� said Harry.

 ��Who are you?�� Krum asked. 

 ��Barny Weasley.��

 They shook hands. 

 ��You, Barny �C you know this man Lovegood well?��

 ��No, I only met him today. Why?�� 

Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several 
warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. 

��Because,�� said Krum, ��If he vus not a guest of Fleur��s I vould duel him, here and now, for 
veering that filthy sign upon his chest.�� 

��Sign?�� said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye was gleaming 
on his chest. ��Why? What��s wrong with it?��

 ��Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald��s sign.��

 ��Grindelwald... the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?��

 ��Exactly.�� 

Krum��s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, ��Grindelvald killed many 

people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never powerful in this country, they said he

��106ҳ��

feared Dumbledore �C and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this�� �C he pointed a finger at 
Xenophilius �C ��this is his symbol, I recognized it at vunce, Grindelvald carved it into a vall at 
Durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to 
shock, make themselves impressive �C until those of us who had lost family members to 
Grindelvald taught them better.�� 

Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It 
seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna��s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in 
the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, fin-like shape. 

 ��Are you �C er �C quite sure it��s Grindelwald��s -?�� 

��I am not mistaken,�� said Krum coldly. ��I walked past that sign for several years, I know it 
vell.�� 

��Well, there��s a chance,�� said Harry, ��that Xenophilius doesn��t actually know what the symbol 
means, the Lovegoods are quite... unusual. He could have easily picked it up somewhere and think 
it��s a cross section����� of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something.��

 ��The cross section of a vot?��

 ��Well, I don��t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for 
them.��

 Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father. 

��That��s her,�� he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her arms around 

her head like someone attempting to beat off midges��. 

 ��Vy is she doing that?�� asked Krum.

 ��Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,�� said Harry, who recognized the symptoms. 

Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He drew his wand 

from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs; sparks flew out of the end. 

��Gregorovitch!�� said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care; the 
memory had come back to him at the sight of Krum��s wand, Ollivander taking it and examining it 
carefully before the Triwizard Tournament.

 ��Vot about him?�� asked Krum suspiciously.

 ��He��s a wandmaker!��

 ��I know that,�� said Krum.

��107ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He made your wand! That��s why I thought �C Quidditch �C��

 Krum was looking more and more suspicious.

 ��How do you know Gregorovitch made my wand?�� 

��I... I read it somewhere, I think,�� said Harry. ��In a �C a fan magazine,�� he improvised wildly 
and Krum looked mollified.

 ��I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,�� he said.

 ��So... er... where is Gregorowitch these days?�� 

Krum looked puzzled. ��He retired several years ago. I was one of the last to purchase a 
Gregorovitch vand. They are the best �Calthough I know, of course, that your Britons set much store 
by Ollivander.�� 

Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. 
So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and Harry did not have to search far for a 
reason. It was surely because of what Harry�� wand had done on the night that Voldemort pursued 
him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, some 
thing that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would Gregorowitch know better? Was he 
truly more skilled than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not? 

��This girl is very nice-looking,�� Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings. Krum was 
pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. ��She is also a relative of yours?�� 

��Yeah,�� said Harry, suddenly irritated, ��and she��s seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. 
You wouldn��t want to cross him.�� 

Krum grunted. 

��Vot,�� he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, ��is the point of being an 
international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?�� 

And he strode off leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way 
around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about 
Gregorovitch, but he was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. Harry leaned up 
against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and 
George��s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron. 

He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations 
differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding

cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of 
champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As the evening drew in, and moths began 
to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and 
more uncontained. Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of 
Fleur��s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing ��Odo the 
Hero�� in the corner. 

Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron��s who seemed unsure 
whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of 

white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock 


and was topped by a moth-

eaten fez������ձñ . He was vaguely familiar. Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that 
this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore��s 
obituary.

 Harry approached him.

 ��May I sit down?��

 ��Of course, of course,�� said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice.

 Harry leaned in. ��Mr. Doge, I��m Harry Potter.�� 

Doge gasped. ��My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. I am so glad, so 
honored!��

 In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne. ��I thought of writing 
to you,�� he whispered, ��after Dumbledore... the shock... and for you, I am sure...�� Doge��s tiny eyes 
filled with sudden tears. 

��I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,�� said Harry. ��I didn��t realize you knew 
Professor Dumbledore so well.��

 ��As well as anyone,�� said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. ��Certainly I knew him longest, 
if you don��t count Aberforth �C and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.��

 ��Speaking of the Daily Prophet... I don��t know whether you saw, Mr. Doge -?��

 ��Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.��

 ��Elphias, I don��t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?�� 

Doge��s face flooded with angry color. ��Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might

be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her, I am ashamed to say that I became 
rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you my have seen, in aspersions cast 
upon my sanity.�� 

��Well, in that interview,�� Harry went on, ��Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was 
involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.�� 

��Don��t believe a word of it!�� said Doge at once. ��Not a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your 
memories of Albus Dumbledore!�� 

Harry looked into Doge��s earnest, pained face, and felt, not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge 
really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn��t Doge 
understand Harry��s need to be sure, to know everything?�� 

Perhaps Doge suspected Harry��s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, ��Harry, Rita 

Skeeter is a dreadful �C��

 But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.

 ��Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!�� 

Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hair, 

a goblet of champagne in her hand. ��She��s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!�� 

��Hello, Muriel,�� said Doge, ��Yes, we were just discussing �C��

 ��You there! Give me your chair, I��m a hundred and seven!�� 

Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel 
swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and 
Harry. 

��Hello again, Barry or whatever your name is,�� she said to Harry, ��Now what were you saying 
about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know, she��s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can��t wait to 
read it. I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!�� 

Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony 
fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. 

She took another large gulp of champagne, belched and then said, ��There��s no need to look like 
a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh (nonesense, 
rubbish), there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!��

 ��Ill-informed sniping�̰�����,�� said Doge, turning radish-colored again.

��110ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��You would say that, Elphias,�� cackled Auntie Muriel. ��I noticed how you skated over�ӹ� ;��
�� the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!�� 

��I��m sorry you think so,�� said Doge, more coldly still. ��I assure you I was writing from the 
heart.�� 

��Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you��ll still think he was a saint even 
if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!��

 ��Muriel!�� exclaimed Doge. 

 A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry��s chest. 

��What do you mean?�� he asked Muriel. ��Who said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was 

ill?�� 

��Thought wrong, then, didn��t you, Barry!�� said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted at the effect 
she had produced. ��Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it? It all happened 
years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who 
were alive then never knew what really happened. That��s why I can��t wait to find out what 
Skeeter��s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!��

 ��Untrue!�� wheezed Doge, ��Absolutely untrue!��

 ��He never told me his sister was a Squib,�� said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside. 

��And why on earth would he tell you?�� screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she 
attempted to focus upon Harry. 

��The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,�� began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, ��is, 
I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death �C�� 

��Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?�� squawked Muriel, ��Why did half of us never even 
know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where 
was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never 
mind what was going on in his own house!��

 ��What d��you mean, locked in the cellar?�� asked Harry. ��What is this?��

 Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry. 

��Dumbledore��s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard 
she pretended otherwise.�� 

��She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,�� whispered Doge

��111ҳ��

miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him. 

��-proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a 
Squib-��

 ��Ariana was not a Squib!�� wheezed Doge. 

��So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!�� said Auntie Muriel. 
She turned back to Harry. ��In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, though to take it to the 
extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn��t exist �C�� 

��I tell you, that��s not what happened!�� said Doge, but Auntie Muriel steamrollered on, still 
addressing Harry. 

��Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the 
Muggle community... much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where 
they must always be second class, but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn��t have dreamed of 
letting her daughter go to a Muggle school �C��

 ��Ariana was delicate!�� said Doge desperately. ��Her health was always too poor to permit her �C�� 

��-to permit her to leave the house?�� cackled Muriel. ��And yet she was never taken to St. 
Mungo��s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!��

 ��Really, Muriel, how can you possibly know whether ...�� 

��For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo��s at the time, 

and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All most 

suspicious, Lancelot thought!�� 

Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. 

Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more 
champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, 
kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore��s sister suffered the 
same fate in reverse, imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to her 
fate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented? 

��Now, if Kendra hadn��t died first,�� Muriel resumed, ��I��d have said that it was she who finished 
off Ariana �C�� 

��How can you, Muriel!�� groaned Doge. ��A mother kill her own daughter? Think what you��re 
saying!��

��112ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end, why not?�� 
shrugged Auntie Muriel. ��But as I say, it doesn��t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana �C of what, 
nobody ever seemed sure. 

��Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,�� 
said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. ��Shake your head all you like, Elphias. You were at Ariana��s 
funeral, were you not?�� 

��Yes I was,�� said Doge, through trembling lips, ��and a more desperately sad occasion I cannot 
remember. Albus was heartbroken-�� 

��His heart wasn��t the only thing. Didn��t Aberforth break Albus�� nose halfway through the 
service?�� 

If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might 
have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down 
her chin. 

 ��How do you -?�� croaked Doge. 

��My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,�� said Auntie Muriel happily. ��Bathilda 
described the whole thing to mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl. The 
way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus�� fault that Ariana was dead and then 
punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that��s odd 
enough in itself. Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his 
back. 

Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her 
as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe. He wanted the 
truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could 
hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside 
his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story. 

��And I��ll tell you something else,�� Muriel said, hiccupping slightly as she lowered her goblet. 
��I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter��s interview about 
an important source close to the Dumbledores �C goodness knows she was there all through the 
Ariana business, and it would fit!��

 ��Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!�� whispered Doge. 

��113ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Bathilda Bagshot?�� Harry said. ��The author of A History of Magic?�� 

The name was printed on the front of one of Harry��s textbooks, though admittedly not one of 
the ones he had read more attentively. 

��Yes,�� said Doge, clutching at Harry��s question like a drowning man at a life heir. ��A most 
gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus��s.��

 ��Quite gaga these days, I��ve heard,�� said Auntie Muriel cheerfully. 

��If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her,�� said 

Doge, ��and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!�� 

��Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I��m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,�� 
said Auntie Muriel ��But even if Bathilda��s completely cuckoo, I��m sure she��d still have old 
photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. Well worth a trip to 
Godric��s Hollow, I��d have thought.�� 

Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the back as Harry 
coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, 
he asked, ��Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric��s Hollow?�� 

��Oh yes, she��s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was 

imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.��

 ��The Dumbledores lived in Godric��s Hollows?��

 ��Yes, Barry, that��s what I just said,�� said Auntie Muriel testily. 

Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had 
both lived and lost loved ones in Godric��s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and James buried close to 
Dumbledore��s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, perhaps walked past Lily��s 
and James��s to do so? And he had never once told Harry ... never bothered to say... 

And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt it had been 
tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common. He 
stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and did not realize that 
Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him. 

��I simply can��t dance anymore,�� she panted, slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole 
of her foot. ��Ron��s gone looking to find more butterbeers. It��s a bit odd. I��ve just seen Viktor 
storming away from Luna��s father, it looked like they��d been arguing �C�� She dropped her voice,

��114ҳ��

staring at him. ��Harry, are you okay?�� 

Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter, at that moment, something large and 
silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynxɽè
��� landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as those nearest it froze 
absurdly in mid-dance. Then the Patronus��s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, 
slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt.

 ��The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.��

Chapter Nine 

A Place to Hide 

Everything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and 


Hermione jumped 
to their feet and drew their wands. Many people 

were only just 
realizing that something strange had happened; 

heads were still 
turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. 

Silence spread 
outward in cold ripples from the place where the 

Patronus had 
landed. Then somebody screamed. 
Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests were sprinting in all 

directions; many were Disapparating; the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken. 

 ��Ron!�� Hermione cried. ��Ron, where are you?�� 

As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw cloaked and masked figures 
appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them 
shout, ��Protego!��, a cry that was echoed on all sides �C 

��Ron! Ron!�� Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffeted by terrified guests, 
Harry seized her hand to make sure they weren��t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their 
heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know �C 

And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione��s free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the 
spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was 
Hermione��s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from 
the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself... 

 ��Where are we?�� said Ron��s voice. 

Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all; they 
still seemed to be surrounded by people. 

��Tottenham Court Road,�� panted Hermione. ��Walk, just walk, we need to find somewhere for 
you to change.�� 

Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street thronged with late-
night revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus 
rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still

��116ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

wearing dress robes. 

��Hermione, we haven��t got anything to change into,�� Ron told her, as a young woman burst 
into raucous giggles at the sight of him.

 ��Why didn��t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?�� said Harry, inwardly cursing his 
own stupidity. ��All last year I kept it on me and �C��

 ��It��s okay, I��ve got the Cloak, I��ve got clothes for both of you,�� said Hermione, ��Just try and act 
naturally until �C this will do.��

 She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway. 

��When you say you��ve got the Cloak, and clothes ...�� said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who 
was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging. 

��Yes, they��re here,�� said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron��s utter astonishment, she pulled out a 
pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.

 ��How the ruddy hell �C?�� 

��Undetectable Extension Charm,�� said Hermione. ��Tricky, but I think I��ve done it okay; 
anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.�� She gave the fragile-looking bag a little 
shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. ��Oh, 
damn, that��ll be the books,�� she said, peering into it, ��and I had them all stacked by subject. Oh 
well... Harry, you��d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change.��

 ��When did you do all this?�� Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes. 

��I told you at the Burrow, I��ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed 
to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and put 
it in here... I just had a feeling... ��

 ��You��re amazing, you are,�� said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes. 

��Thank you,�� said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag. 
��Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!�� 

Harry threw his Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head, 
vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened.

 ��The others �C everybody at the wedding �C��

 ��We can��t worry about that now,�� whispered Hermione. ��It��s you they��re after, Harry, and we��ll 

just put everyone in even more danger by going back.��

��117ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��She��s right,�� said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even if he could 
not see his face. ��Most of the Order was there, they��ll look after everyone.�� 

Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, ��Yeah.�� But he thought 
of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.

 ��Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,�� said Hermione. 

They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group of men on the 

opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement.

 ��Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?�� Ron asked Hermione. 

��I��ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I��m sure we��re safer out in the Muggle world, 

it��s not where they��ll expect us to be.��

 ��True,�� said Ron, looking around, ��but don��t you feel a bit �C exposed?��

 ��Where else is there?�� asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other side of the road started 
wolf-whistling at her. ��We can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And 
Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there... I suppose we could try my parents�� home, 
though I think there��s a chance they might check there... Oh, I wish they��d shut up!�� 

��All right, darling?�� the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. ��Fancy a 
drink? Ditch ginger (reddish brown color) and come and have a pint!�� 

��Let��s sit down somewhere,�� Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to shout back 
across the road. ��Look, this will do, in here!�� 

It was a small and shabby all-night caf��. A light layer of grease lay on all the Formica-topped 
tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite 
Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it, she glanced over her shoulder so 
frequently she appeared to have a twitch�鴤 . Harry did not like being stationary; walking had 
given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of 
Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses 
out of his pocket and put them on again. 

After a minute or two, Ron said, ��You know, we��re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it��s 

only in Charing Cross �C��

 ��Ron, we can��t!�� said Hermione at once.

 ��Not to stay there, but to find out what��s going on!��

��118ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We know what��s going on! Voldemort��s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to 
know?��

 ��Okay, okay, it was just an idea!�� They relapsed into a prickly silence. 

The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos, As Harry 
was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the 
caf�� and squeezed into the next booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper. 

��I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. Once we��re there, we 

could send a message to the Order.��

 ��Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?�� asked Ron. 

 ��I��ve been practicing and I think so,�� said Hermione. 

��Well, as long as it doesn��t get them into trouble, though they might��ve been arrested already. 
God, that��s revolting,�� Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had 
heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers�� orders. The larger 
of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved 
her away. She stared, affronted. 

��Let��s get going, then, I don��t want to drink this muck,�� said Ron. ��Hermione, have you got 
Muggle money to pay for this?�� 

��Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. I��ll bet all the 
change is at the bottom,�� sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag. 

The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious 
thought, all three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going 
on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench. The force of the Death 
Eaters�� spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron��s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, 
yelled, ��Stupefy!�� 

The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light, He slumped sideways, 
unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron, Shining 
black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot �C the waitress screamed and ran 
for the door �C Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had 
tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in 
front of the door. 

��119ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Expulso!�� bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up. 
The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the 
Cloak slipped off him. 

��Petrificus Totalus!�� screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater fell forward 
like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. 
Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and 
trembling all over. 

��D-diffindo,�� she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she slashed open the 
knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. ��Oh, I��m so sorry, Ron, my hand��s shaking! Diffindo!�� 

The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. 
Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was 
sprawled across the bench. 

��I should��ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,�� he said. He turned over 
the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man��s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron and 
Hermione. 

��That��s Dolohov,�� said Ron. ��I recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one��s 
Thorfinn Rowle.�� 

��Never mind what they��re called!�� said Hermione a little hysterically. ��How did they find us? 
What are we going to do?��

 Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry��s head.

 ��Lock the door,�� he told her, ��and Ron, turn out the lights.�� 

He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the 
Deluminator to plunge the caf�� into darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at 
Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance. 

��What are we going to do with them?�� Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; then, even 
more quietly, ��Kill them? They��d kill us. They had a good go just now.��

 Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head. 

��We just need to wipe their memories,�� said Harry. ��It��s better like that, it��ll throw them off the 
scent. If we killed them it��d be obvious we were here.�� 

��You��re the boss,�� said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. ��But I��ve never done a Memory

��120ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Charm.��

 ��Nor have I,�� said Hermione, ��but I know the theory.�� 

She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov��s forehead and said, 

��Obliviate.��

 At once, Dolohov��s eyes became unfocused and dreamy. 

��Brilliant!�� said Harry, clapping her on the back. ��Take care of the other one and the waitress 

while Ron and I clear up.�� 

��Clear up?�� said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed caf��. ��Why?�� 

��Don��t you think they might wonder what��s happened if they wake up and find themselves in a 

place that looks like it��s just been bombed?��

 ��Oh right, yeah ...��

 Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket.

 ��It��s no wonder I can��t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they��re tight.�� 

��Oh, I��m so sorry,�� hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the 
windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead. 

Once the caf�� was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters back into 
their booth and propped them up facing each other. ��But how did they find us?�� Hermione asked, 
looking from one inert man to the other. ��How did they know where we were?��

 She turned to Harry.

 ��You �C you don��t think you��ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?�� 

��He can��t have,�� said Ron. ��The Trace breaks at seventeen, that��s Wizarding law, you can��t put 
it on an adult.��

 ��As far as you know,�� said Hermione. ��What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a 
seventeen-year-old?�� 

��But Harry hasn��t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who��s supposed to 
have put a Trace back on him?�� 

Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted. Was that really how the Death Eaters 
had found them? 

��If I can��t use magic, and you can��t use magic near me, without us giving away our position �C �� 
he began. 

��121ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We��re not splitting up!�� said Hermione firmly.

 ��We need a safe place to hide,�� said Ron. ��Give us time to think things through.��

 ��Grimmauld Place,�� said Harry.

 The other two gaped.

 ��Don��t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!�� 

��Ron��s dad said they��ve put up jinxes against him �C and even if they haven��t worked,�� he 
pressed on as Hermione began to argue ��so what? I swear, I��d like nothing better than to meet 

Snape!��

 ��But �C�� 

��Hermione, where else is there? It��s the best chance we��ve got. Snape��s only one Death Eater. 

If I��ve still got the Trace on me, we��ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.�� 

She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she unlocked the 
caf�� door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the caf����s light. Then, on Harry��s count of three, 
they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death 
Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned on the spot and 
vanished into the compressing darkness once more. 

Seconds later Harry��s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes. They were now 
standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down 
on them from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had been told of its 
existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking every few yards 
that they were not being followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the 
front door once with his wand. They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then 
the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold. 

As Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas lamps sprang into life, casting 
flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it, eerie, 
cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. 
Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of Sirius��s mother. The only thing that was out of place 
was the troll��s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over 
again.

 ��I think somebody��s been in here,�� Hermione whispered, pointing toward it.

��122ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��That could��ve happened as the Order left,�� Ron murmured back.

 ��So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?�� Harry asked.

 ��Maybe they��re only activated if he shows up?�� suggested Ron. 

Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared to move farther 
into the house. 

 ��Well, we can��t stay here forever,�� said Harry, and he took a step forward. 

��Severus Snape?�� 

Mad-Eye Moody��s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them jump back in 

fright. 

��We��re not Snape!�� croaked Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his 
tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak. Before he had time to feel inside 
his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. 

The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron was making 
retching noises; Hermione stammered, ��That m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse 
Mad-Eye set up for Snape!�� 

Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the 
hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, 
dust-colored, and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, her curtains flying open; the 
gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming 
behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets, horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it 
raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry. 

��No!�� Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. ��No! It 
wasn��t us! We didn��t kill you �C�� 

On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust, Coughing, his eyes watering, 
Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her 
head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and 
saying, ��It��s all r-right... It��s g-gone... �� 

Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black continued to 
scream.

 ��Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers �C��

��123ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��SHUT UP!�� Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red 
sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her. 

 ��That ... that was ...�� Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. 

��Yeah,�� said Harry, ��but it wasn��t really him, was it? Just something to scare Snape.�� 

Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure aside as casually 
as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-
expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along 
the skirting board���ڰ�, �Ű�=baseboard. 

��Before we go any farther, I think we��d better check,�� whispered Hermione, and she raised her 

wand and said, ��Homenum revelio.��

 Nothing happened. 

 ��Well, you��ve just had a big shock,�� said Ron kindly. ��What was that supposed to do?�� 

��It did what I meant it to do!�� said Hermione rather crossly. ��That was a spell to reveal human 
presence, and there��s nobody here except us!�� 

��And old Dusty,�� said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-figure had 
risen. 

��Let��s go up,�� said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led the way up 
the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. 

Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drafty 
room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window 
and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch. 

��Can��t see anyone out there,�� he reported. ��And you��d think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, 
they��d have followed us here. I know they can��t get in the house, but �C what��s up, Harry?�� 

Harry had given a cry of pain. His scar had burned again as something flashed across his mind 
like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound 
through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock. 

 ��What did you see?�� Ron asked, advancing on Harry. ��Did you see him at my place?��

 ��No, I just felt anger �C he��s really angry �C�� 

��But that could be at the Burrow,�� said Ron loudly. ��What else? Didn��t you see anything? Was 
he cursing someone?��

��No, I just felt anger �C I couldn��t tell �C�� 

Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice, 
��Your scar, again? But what��s going on? I thought that connection had closed!�� 

��It did, for a while,�� muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard to 
concentrate. ��I �C I think it��s started opening again whenever he loses control, that��s how it used to 
�C�� 

��But then you��ve got to close your mind!�� said Hermione shrilly. ��Harry, Dumbledore didn��t 
want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that��s why you were supposed to 
use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember �C�� 

��Yeah, I do remember, thanks,�� said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to 
tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame (identical, exactly the same) connection 
between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius��s death. He wished that he 
had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he 
were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he 
fought it. It was like resisting the urge to be sick. 

He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black 
family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked, Harry drew his wand again and spun around to 
see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of 
them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron��s father.

 ��Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.�� 

The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan 
and dropped onto the sofa, Hermione joined him, gripping his arm.

 ��They��re all right, they��re all right!�� she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her. 

 ��Harry,�� he said over Hermione��s shoulder, ��I �C�� 

��It��s not a problem,�� said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. ��It��s your family, 'course you 

were worried. I��d feel the same way.�� He thought of Ginny. ��I do feel the same way.�� 

The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had back in the garden of the Burrow. 
Faintly he heard Hermione say ��I don��t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags 
I��ve brought and camp in here tonight?��

 He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer. He had to succumb.

��Bathroom,�� he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running. 

He barely made it. Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding 
head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him 
possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the giant blond Death Eater on the floor, 
screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry 
spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice. 

��More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he 
will forgive this time... You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? 
Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure... Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!�� 

A log fell in the fire, flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face �C 
with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes. 

He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches from one of the silver 
serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy��s gaunt, petrified face seemed 
burned on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which 
Draco was now being put by Voldemort.

 There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione��s voice rang out.

 ��Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I��ve got it here.��

 ��Yeah, great, thanks,�� he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in.

Chapter Ten 
Kreacher��s Tale 


Harry woke early next morning, 


wrapped 
in a sleeping bag on the drawing room 

floor. A 
chink of sky was visible between the 

heavy 
curtains. It was the cool, clear blue of 

watered 
ink, somewhere between night and 

dawn, 
and everything was quiet except for Ron 

and 
Hermione��s slow, deep breathing. Harry 

glanced 
over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and 
insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above 
his. Her arm curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron��s. Harry wondered whether they had 
fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely. 

He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than twenty-four house 
ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in 
wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen now? He lay on the floor 
and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting (intimidating, awesome) complex mission 
Dumbledore had left him... Dumbledore... 

The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore��s death felt different now. The accusations 
he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things, 
infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could Dumbledore have let such things 
happen? Had he been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect 
him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden? 

Harry thought of Godric��s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never mentioned there; he 
thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledore��s will, and resentment 
swelled in the darkness. Why hadn��t Dumbledore told him? Why hadn��t he explained? Had 
Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be 
polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in?

��127ҳ��

Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for 
something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping bad, picked up his wand, and crept 
out of the room. On the landing he whispered, ��Lumos,�� and started to climb the stairs by 
wandlight. 

On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time they had been 
here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes������Ʒ had been 
ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the 
house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this 
house both before and after Sirius died? Harry��s gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes 
contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius��s great-great grandfather, but it was empty, showing 
nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the 
headmaster��s study at Hogwarts. 

Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two 
doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading Sirius. Harry had never entered his 
godfather��s bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his wand high to cast light as 
widely as possible. The room was spacious and must once have been handsome. There was a large 
bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a 
chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle scrubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging in 
frostlike drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed��s headboard; a 
spiders web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as 
Harry moved deeper into the room, he head a scurrying of disturbed mice. 

The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the 
wall��s silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Sirius��s parents had been unable 
to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall because he was sure they 
would not have appreciated their eldest son��s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have long gone 
out of his way to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and 
gold just to underline his difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many 
pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius��s nerve) several posters of 
bikini-clad Muggle girls. Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite

��128ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in 
contrast to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four Hogwarts 
students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera. 

With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father, his untidy black hair stuck up at the back 
like Harry��s, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly 
arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius��s right 
stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his 
inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. 
On James��s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted 
surprise at finding himself liked and included or was it simply because Harry knew how it had 
been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after 
all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in 
preventing his parents from redecorating his room. 

Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brightest. A shaft of light 
revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius��s 
bedroom had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly, if not 
entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with the 
covers and sundry���ֵ� pages littered the floor. 

Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined them. He recognized 
one as a part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as 
belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten and crumpled. He 
smoothed it out. 

Dear Padfoot,

 Thank you, thank you, for Harry��s birthday present! It was his favorite by far. One year old and 
already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself. I��m enclosing a 
picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground but he nearly killed the 
cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of 
course James thought it was so funny, says he��s going to be a great Quidditch player but we��ve 
had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don��t take our eyes off him when he gets

��129ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

going. 

We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda who has always been sweet to us and 
who dotes�簮 on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn��t come, but the Order��s got to come first, 
and Harry��s not old enough to know it��s his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut 
up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell �C also Dumbledore��s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so 
no chance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy was here 
last weekend. I thought he seemed down, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; I 
cried all evening when I heard. 

Bathilda drops in most days, she��s a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about 
Dumbledore. I��m not sure he��d be pleased if he knew! I don��t know how much to believe, actually 
because it seems incredible that Dumbledore 

Harry��s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite still, holding the miraculous 
paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent joy and grief 
thundering its equal measure through his veins. Lurching to the bed, he sat down. 

He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time, 
and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. She had made her ��g��s the same way he did. 
He searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt like a friendly little wave 
glimpsed from behind a veil. The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, 
really lived, that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment, tracing ink into these 
letters, these words, words about him, Harry, her son. 

Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time concentrating 
on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered voice.

 They had a cat... perhaps it had perished, like his parents at Godric��s Hollow... or else fled when 
there was nobody left to feed it... Sirius had bought him his first broomstick... His parents had 
known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced them? Dumbledore��s still got his Invisibility 
Cloak... there was something funny there... 

Harry paused, pondering his mother��s words. Why had Dumbledore taken James��s Invisibility 
Cloak? Harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before, ��I don��t need a cloak 
to become invisible��. Perhaps some less gifted Order member had needed its assistance, and 
Dumbledore had acted as a carrier? Harry passed on... 

��130ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Wormy was here... Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed ��down�� had he? Was he aware that he was 
seeing James and Lily alive for the last time? 

And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dumbledore. It seems incredible 
that Dumbledore 


That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would seem incredible about 
Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test, for instance or had 
taken up goat charming like Aberforth... 

Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor, Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere. 
He seized papers, treating them in his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original 
searcher, he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of 
the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair. 

At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the 
chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph that Lily had 
described in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, 
roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing after him. 
Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily��s letter and continued to look for the second 
sheet. 

After another quarter of an hour, however he was forced to conclude that the rest of his 
mother��s letter was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had 
been written, or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room? Harry read the first sheet 
again, this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His toy 
broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters... The only potentially useful 
thing he could see her was possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that 
Dumbledore �C what? 

��Harry? Harry? Harry!�� 

��I��m here!�� he called, ��What��s happened?�� 

There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst inside. 

��We woke up and didn��t know where you were!�� she said breathlessly. She turned and shouted 
over her shoulder, ��Ron! I��ve found him�� 

Ron��s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below.

��131ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Good! Tell him from me he��s a git!�� 

��Harry, don��t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did you come up here anyway?�� 
She gazed around the ransacked room. ��What have you been doing?�� 

��Look what I��ve just found.�� 

He held out his mother��s letter. Hermione took it out and read it while Harry watched her. When 

she reached the end of the page she looked up at him. 

��Oh Harry...�� 

��And there��s this too.�� 

He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of 

sight on the toy broom. 

��I��ve been looking for the rest of the letter,�� Harry said, ��but it��s not here.�� 

Hermione glanced around. 

��Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?�� 

��Someone had searched before me,�� said Harry. 

��I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. What were they after, 

do you think?�� 

��Information on the Order, if it was Snape.�� 

��But you��d think he��d already have all he needed. I mean he was in the Order, wasn��t he?�� 

��Well then,�� said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, ��what about information on Dumbledore? 

The second page of the letter, for instance. You know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know 

who she is?�� 

��Who?�� 

��Bathilda Bagshot, the author of �C�� 

��A History of Magic,�� said Hermione, looking interested. ��So your parents knew her? She was 

an incredible magic historian.�� 

��And she��s still alive,�� said Harry, ��and she lives in Godric��s Hollow. Ron��s Auntie Muriel was 
talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore��s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk 
to, wouldn��t she?�� 

There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him for Harry��s liking. 
He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so

��132ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

as not to have to look at her and give himself away. 

��I understand why you��d love to talk to her about your mum and dad, and Dumbledore too,�� 
said Hermione. ��But that wouldn��t really help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?�� 

Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, ��Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric��s 
Hollow, but I��m scared. I��m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just 
makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I��m 
sure they��d be expecting you to visit it.�� 

��It��s not just that,�� Harry said, still avoiding looking at her, ��Muriel said stuff about 
Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth...�� 

He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he had finished, Hermione said, 
��Of course, I can see why that��s upset you, Harry �C��

 ��I��m not upset,�� he lied, ��I��d just like to know whether or not it��s true or �C�� 

��Harry do you really think you��ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from 

Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dumbledore!��

 ��I thought I did,�� he muttered. 

��But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, 
how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?�� 

He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it was again, choose what to 
believe. He wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined that he should not get it? 

��Shall we go down to the kitchen?�� Hermione suggested after a little pause. ��Find something 
for breakfast?�� 

He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing and past the second door that 
led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not 
noticed in the dark. He passed at the top of the stairs to read it. It was a pompous little sign, neatly 
lettered by hand, the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door. 

Do Not Enter 
Without the Express Permission of 
Regulus Arcturus Black


��133ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Excitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately sure why. He read the sign 

again. Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him.

 ��Hermione,�� he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm. ��Come back up here.��

 ��What��s the matter?��

 ��R.A.B. I think I��ve found him.��

 There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs. 

 ��In your mum��s letter? But I didn��t see �C��

 Harry shook his head, pointing at Regulus��s sign. 

She read it, then clutched Harry��s arm so tightly that he winced. 

 ��Sirius��s brother?�� she whispered. 

 ��He was a Death Eater,�� said Harry. ��Sirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really 
young and then got cold feet and tried to leave �C so they killed him.�� 

��That fits!�� gasped Hermione. ��If he was a Death Eater he had access to Voldemort, and if he 

became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down!��

 She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, ��Ron! RON! Get up here, quick!��

 Ron appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his hand. 

 ��What��s up? If it��s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I �C��

 He frowned at the sign on Regulus��s door, in which Hermione was silently pointing. 

��What? That was Sirius��s brother, wasn��t it? Regulus Arcturus ... Regulus ... R.A.B.! The locket 

�C you don��t reckon - ?�� 
��Let��s find out,�� said Harry. He pushed the door. It was locked. Hermione pointed her wand at 
the handle and said, ��Alohamora.�� There was a click, and the door swung open. 
They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus��s bedroom was slightly 
smaller than Sirius��s, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought 
to advertise his diffidence from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the 
opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, 
and the windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its 
motto, TOUJOURS PUR. Beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck 
together to make a ragged collage����������. Hermione crossed the room to examine them. 

��They��re all about Voldemort,�� she said. ��Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years

��134ҳ��

before he joined the Death Eaters ...�� 

A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. Harry, 
meanwhile, had noticed another photograph, a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving 
out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests, Slytherins. 
Regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row, He had the 
same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, slighter, and rather 
less handsome than Sirius had been. 

 ��He played Seeker,�� said Harry. 

��What?�� said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort��s press clippings. 

��He��s sitting in the middle of the front row, that��s where the Seeker ... Never mind,�� said Harry, 
realizing that nobody was listening. Ron was on his hands and knees, searching under the 
wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk. Yet 
again, somebody had searched before them. The drawers�� contents had been turned over recently, 
the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there, old quills, out-of-date textbooks that bore 
evidence of being roughly handled, a recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the 
contents of the drawer. 

��There��s an easier way,�� said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans. She 
raised her wand and said, ��Accio Locket!�� 

Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, looked 
disappointed.

 ��Is that it, then? It��s not here?�� 

��Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,�� said Hermione. ��Charms to 
prevent it from being summoned magically, you know.�� 

��Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,�� said Harry, remembering how he had been 
unable to Summon the fake locket.

 ��How are we supposed to find it then?�� asked Ron. 

 ��We search manually,�� said Hermione. 

��That��s a good idea,�� said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his examination of the 
curtains. 

They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were forced, finally, to

��135ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

conclude that the locket was not there.

 The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows. 

��It could be somewhere else in the house, though,�� said Hermione in a rallying tone as they 
walked back downstairs. As Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, she seemed to have 
become more determined. ��Whether he��d manage to destroy it or not, he��d want to keep it hidden 
from Voldemort, wouldn��t he? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we 
were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle 
Ron; Regulus might have put them there to protect the locket��s hiding place, even though we 
didn��t realize it at ... at ... �� 

Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in midair, with the dumbstruck 

look of one who had just been Obliviated, her eyes had even drifted out of focus. 

 ��... at the time,�� she finished in a whisper. 

 ��Something wrong?�� asked Ron. 

 ��There was a locket.��

 ��What?�� said Harry and Ron together.

 ��In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we ... we ... �� 

Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach. He remembered. 
He had even handled the thing as they passed it around, each trying in turn to pry it open. It had 
been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box 
that had made everyone sleepy ...�� 

��Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,�� said Harry. It was the only chance, the only 
slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go. ��He had a whole 
stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C��mon.�� 

He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along in his wake. 
They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Sirius��s mother as they passed through the 
hall. 

��Filth! Mudbloods! Scum!�� she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement 
kitchen and slammed the door behind them. Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at 
the door of Kreacher��s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the nest of dirty old blankets in 
which the house-elf had once slept, but they were not longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher

��136ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy of Nature��s Nobility, A Wizarding Genealogy. 
Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell 
out and rolled dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; 
Hermione closed her eyes.

 ��It��s not over yet,�� said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, ��Kreacher!�� 

There was a loud crack and the house elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius 
appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace, tiny, half human-sized, his pale 
skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears. He was still 
wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him, and the contemptuous look he bent upon 
Harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit. 

��Master,�� croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog��s voice, and he bowed low; muttering to his knees, 
��back in my Mistress��s old house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood �C�� 

��I forbid you to call anyone 'blood traitor' or 'Mudblood,'�� growled Harry. He would have 
found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctively unlovable object even 
if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort. 

��I��ve got a question for you,�� said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the 
elf, ��and I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand?�� 

��Yes, Master,�� said Kreacher, bowing low again. Harry saw his lips moving soundlessly, 
undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter. 

��Two years ago,�� said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs, ��there was a big gold 
locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back?�� 

There was a moment��s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the 
face. Then he said, ��Yes.��

 ��Where is it now?�� asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful.

 Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word. 

 ��Gone.��

 ��Gone?�� echoed Harry, elation floating out of him, ��What do you mean, it��s gone?��

 The elf shivered. He swayed.

 ��Kreacher,�� said Harry fiercely, ��I order you �C�� 

��Mundungus Fletcher,�� croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. ��Mundungus Fletcher stole it

all; Miss Bella��s and Miss Cissy��s pictures, my Mistress��s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, 
the goblets with the family crest, and �C and �C �� 

Kreacher was gulping for air, His hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly, then his eyes flew 
open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream.

 ��- and the locket, Master Regulus��s locket. Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!�� 

Harry reacted instinctively, as Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, he launched 
himself upon the elf, flattening him. Hermione��s scream mingled with Kreacher��s but Harry 
bellowed louder than both of them, ��Kreacher, I order you to stay still!�� 

He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing 
from his sagging eyes.

 ��Harry, let him up!�� Hermione whispered. 

��So he can beat himself up with the poker?�� snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf. ��I don��t 
think so. Right. Kreacher, I want the truth. How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the 
locket?�� 

��Kreacher saw him!�� gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of 
graying teeth. ��Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher��s cupboard with his hands full of 
Kreacher��s treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r-
ran ... �� 

��You called the locket 'Master Regulus��s,'�� said Harry. ��Why? Where did it come from? What 
did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, 
and everything Regulus had to do with it!�� 

The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees, and began to rock 
backward and forward. When he spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, 
echoing kitchen. 

��Master Sirius ran away, good riddance��ϲ�İ��� , for he was a bad boy and broke my 
Mistress��s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper order; he knew what was 
due (suitable) to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the 
Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggleborns 
... and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so 
proud, so happy to serve.

��138ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��And one day, a year after he joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see 

Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said ... he said ...��

 The old elf rocked faster than ever.

 ��... he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.�� 

��Voldemort needed an elf?�� Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked 

just as puzzled as he did. 

��Oh yes,�� moaned Kreacher. ��And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, 
said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the 
Dark Lord ordered him to do ... and then to c-come home.��

 Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs. 

 ��So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, 
but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave was a cavern, and in the 
cavern was a great black lake...�� 

The hairs on the back of Harry��s neck stood up. Kreacher��s croaking voice seemed to come to 
him from across the dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been 
present.

 ��... There was a boat ...�� 

Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as 
to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. This, then, was how Voldemort 
had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux, by borrowing a disposable creature, a house-elf...

 ��There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it ...��

 The elf quaked from head to foot. 

 ��Kreacher drank, and as he drank he saw terrible thing ... Kreacher��s insides burned ... Kreacher 
cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only 
laughed ... He made Kreacher drink all the potion ... He dropped a locket into the empty basin ... 
He filled it with more potion.��

 ��And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island ... �� 

Harry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort��s white, snakelike face vanishing into 
darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within 
minutes, whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning poison caused its

��139ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

victim ... But here, Harry��s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how Kreacher had 
escaped. 

��Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island��s edge and he drank from the black lake ... 
and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface ... ��

 ��How did you get away?�� Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering.

 Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked Harry with his great, bloodshot eyes.

 ��Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,�� he said.

 ��I know �C but how did you escape the Inferi?��

 Kreacher did not seem to understand.

 ��Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,�� he repeated.

 ��I know, but �C ��

 ��Well, it��s obvious, isn��t it, Harry?�� said Ron. ��He Disapparated!��

 ��But ... you couldn��t Apparate in and out of that cave,�� said Harry, ��otherwise Dumbledore �C�� 

��Elf magic isn��t like wizard��s magic, is it?�� said Ron, ��I mean, they can Apparate and 
Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can��t.�� 

There was a silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such a mistake? 
But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy. 

��Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath his notice ... 
It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn��t.�� 

��The house-elf��s highest law is his Master��s bidding,�� intoned Kreacher. ��Kreacher was told to 
come home, so Kreacher came home ... �� 

��Well, then, you did what you were told, didn��t you?�� said Hermione kindly. ��You didn��t 
disobey orders at all!��

 Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever. 

��So what happened when you got back?�� Harry asked. ��What did Regulus say when you told 

him what happened?�� 

��Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,�� croaked Kreacher. ��Master Regulus told 
Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house. And then ... it was a little while later ... Master 
Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Master Regulus was strange, not as 
he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell ... and he asked Kreacher to take him to

��140ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord ... �� 

And so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the 
thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius ... Kreacher knew how to open the concealed 
entrance to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat, this time it was his beloved 
Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison ... 

 ��And he made you drink the poison?�� said Harry, disgusted. 

But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione��s hands leapt to her mouth. She seemed to 
have understood something. 

��M-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had,�� said 
Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. ��And he told Kreacher to take it 
and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets ...��

 Kreacher��s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to understand him. 

��And he order �C Kreacher to leave �C without him. And he told Kreacher �C to go home �C and 
never to tell my Mistress �C what he had done �C but to destroy �C the first locket. And he drank �C all 
the potion �C and Kreacher swapped the lockets �C and watched ... as Master Regulus ... was dragged 
beneath the water ... and ...��

 ��Oh, Kreacher!�� wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her knees beside the elf and 

tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, quite obviously repulsed.

 ��The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his Mistress say?�� 

��I told you not to call her ��Mudblood��!�� snarled Harry, but the elf was already punishing 
himself. He fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor. 

��Stop him �C stop him!�� Hermione cried. ��Oh, don��t you see now how sick it is, the way they��ve 
got to obey?��

 ��Kreacher �C stop, stop!�� shouted Harry. 

The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his snort, a 
bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and 
bloodshot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so pitiful. 

��So you brought the locket home,�� he said relentlessly, for he was determined to know the full 
story. ��And you tried to destroy it?�� 

��Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,�� moaned the elf. ��Kreacher tried everything,

��141ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would work ... So many powerful spells upon the casing. 
Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it would not open ... Kreacher 
punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey 
orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his mistress was mad with grief, because 
Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because 
Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave ...�� 

Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Tears flowed down 
Hermione��s cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who 
was no fan of Kreacher��s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head, trying 
to clear it. 

��I don��t understand you, Kreacher,�� he said finally. ��Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died 
to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy 
to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them ...�� 

��Harry, Kreacher doesn��t think like that,�� said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her 
hand. ��He��s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to 
Kreacher wasn��t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like 
Kreacher? He��s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus 
certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you��re going to 
say,�� she went on as Harry began to protest, ��that Regulus changed his mind ... but he doesn��t 
seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and 
Regulus��s family were all safest if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to 
protect them all.��

 ��Sirius �C �� 

��Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it��s no good looking like that, you know it��s true. 
Kreacher had been alone for such a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably 
starving for a bit of affection. I��m sure ��Miss Cissy�� and ��Miss Bella�� were perfectly lovely to 
Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to 
know. I��ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort 
did ... and so did Sirius.��

��142ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he remembered what 
Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius��s death, I do not think Sirius ever saw 
Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human��s ... 

 ��Kreacher,�� said Harry after a while, ��when you feel up to it, er ... please sit up.�� 

It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccupped himself into silence. Then he pushed himself 
into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child. 

��Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,�� said Harry. He glanced at Hermione for 
assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend that it 
was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval. She smiled 
encouragingly. 

��Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need to find out where 
the locket �C where Master Regulus��s locket is. It��s really important. We want to finish the work 
Master Regulus started, we want to �C er �C ensure that he didn��t die in vain.��

 Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry.

 ��Find Mundungus Fletcher?�� he croaked. 

��And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,�� said Harry. ��Do you think you could do that for 
us?�� 

As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid��s 
purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to 
Voldemort. 

��Kreacher, I��d, er, like you to have this,�� he said, pressing the locket into the elf��s hand. ��This 
belonged to Regulus and I��m sure he��d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you -�� 

��Overkill, mate,�� said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and 
misery, and threw himself back onto the ground. 

It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented 
with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. 
When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched 
him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its 
protection their first priority while he was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, 
and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione��s direction that might have been an attempt at a

��143ҳ��

respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.

Chapter Eleven 
The Bribe 


If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, 


Harry was 
confident that the capture of Mundungus would take 

a few hours at 
most, and he prowled the house all morning in a 

state of high 

anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, 
Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which 
Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help. 

Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had 
appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the 
direction of the house that they could not see. 

��Death Eaters, for sure,�� said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the drawing room 
windows. ��Reckon they know we��re in here?�� 

��I don��t think so,�� said Hermione, though she looked frightened, ��or they��d have sent Snape in 
after us, wouldn��t they?�� 

��D��you reckon he��s been in here and has his tongue tied by Moody��s curse?�� asked Ron. 

��Yes,�� said Hermione, ��otherwise he��d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn��t he? 

But they��re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, 

after all.�� 

��How do they -?�� began Harry. 

��Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They��ll know Sirius left you the 

place.�� 

The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. 
They had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley��s Patronus, 
and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of 
playing with the Deluminator in his pocket. This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was 
whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not 
appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off. 

��Will you stop it!�� she cried on the third evening of Kreacher��s absence, as all the light was

��145ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sucked from the drawing room yet again. 

��Sorry, sorry!�� said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. ��I don��t know I��m 
doing it!�� 

��Well, can��t you find something useful to occupy yourself?�� 

��What, like reading kids�� stories?�� 

��Dumbledore left me this book, Ron �C�� 

����and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I��m supposed to use it!�� 

Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. He 
headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where 
Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he 
heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain. 

Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten. He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows 
beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened, He saw a glimpse of the lamplit 
square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder 
took a step forward, and Moody��s voice asked, ��Severus Snape?�� Then the dust figure rose from 
the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand. 

��It was not I who killed you, Albus,�� said a quiet voice. 

The jinx broke. The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make out the 
newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind. 

Harry pointed the wand into the middle of it. ��Don��t move!�� 

He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black. At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew 
open and she began to scream, ��Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house �C�� 

Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the 
unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below. 

��Hold your fire, it��s me, Remus!�� 

��Oh, thank goodness,�� said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a 

bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did 

not. 

��Show yourself!�� he called back. 

Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender.

��146ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the 
Marauder��s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to 
produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.�� 

��Oh, all right,�� said Harry, lowering his wand, ��but I had to check, didn��t I?�� 

��Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to 
check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn��t be so quick to lower your defenses.�� 

They ran down the stairs towards him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, he looked 
exhausted, but pleased to see them. 

��No sign of Severus, then?�� he asked. 

��No,�� said Harry. ��What��s going on? Is everyone okay?�� 

��Yes,�� said Lupin, ��but we��re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the 

square outside �C�� 

��We know �C�� 

��I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they 
would not see me. They can��t know you��re in here or I��m sure they��d have more people out there; 
they��re staking out everywhere that��s got any connection with you, Harry. Let��s go downstairs, 
there��s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.�� 

They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate. A fire sprang 
up instantly. It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long 
wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down. 

��I��d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,�� said 
Lupin. ��So, you came straight here after the wedding?�� 

��No,�� said Harry, ��only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a caf�� on Tottenham Court 
Road.�� 

Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. ��What?�� 

They explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast. 

��But how did they find you so quickly? It��s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless 
you grab hold of them as they disappear.�� 

��And it doesn��t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, 
does it?�� said Harry.

��147ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We wondered,�� said Hermione tentatively, ��whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?�� 

��Impossible,�� said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. ��Apart from 
anything else, they��d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn��t they? 
But I can��t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that��s worrying, really 
worrying.�� 

He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait. 

��Tell us what happened after we left, we haven��t heard a thing since Ron��s dad told us the 
family was safe.�� 

��Well, Kingsley saved us,�� said Lupin. ��Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were 
able to Disapparate before they arrived.�� 

��Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?�� interjected Hermione. 

��A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they��re the same thing now,�� said Lupin. ��There 
were about a dozen of them, but they didn��t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that 
they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it��s true, he 
didn��t give you away.�� 

Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude 
he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man��s final act 
had been to try to protect Harry. 

��The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,�� Lupin went on. ��They found the 
ghoul, but didn��t want to get too close �C and then they interrogated those of us who remained for 
hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the 
Order knew that you had been there. 

��At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing 
their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,�� he added quickly, 
forestalling the question, ��but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle��s house, but as 
you know he wasn��t there, and they used the Cruciarus Curse on Tonks��s family. Again, trying to 
find out where you went after you visited them. They��re all right �C shaken, obviously, but 
otherwise okay.�� 

��The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?�� Harry asked, remembering how 
effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks��s parents�� garden. 

��148ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��What you��ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the 
Ministry on their side now,�� said Lupin. ��They��ve got the power to perform brutal spells without 
fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we��d cast against 
them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they��d come.�� 

��And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry��s whereabouts out of people?�� 

asked Hermione, an edge to her voice. 

��Well,�� Lupin said. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet. 

��Here,�� he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, ��you��ll know sooner or later anyway. 
That��s their pretext for going after you.�� 

Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. He read 
the headline over it, 

WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT 
THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 


Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the newspaper 
away; he did not want to read anymore, He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had 
been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita 
Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place 
moments after Dumbledore had fallen. 

��I��m sorry, Harry,�� Lupin said. 

��So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?�� asked Hermione furiously. 

Lupin nodded. 

��But surely people realize what��s going on?�� 

��The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,�� said Lupin. 

��The official version of Scrimgeour��s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius 
Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.�� 

��Why didn��t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?�� asked Ron. 

Lupin laughed. 

��He doesn��t need to, Ron. Effectively, he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at

��149ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free 
to extend his power beyond the Ministry. 

��Naturally many people have deduced what has happened. There has been such a dramatic 
change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be 
behind it. However, that is the point. They whisper. They daren��t confide in each other, not 
knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their 
families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have 
provoked open rebellion. Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.�� 

��And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,�� said Harry, ��involves warning the Wizarding 
world against me instead of Voldemort?�� 

��That��s certainly a part of it,�� said Lupin, ��and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is 
dead, you �C the Boy Who Lived �C were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance 
to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero��s death, Voldemort has not 
only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended 
you. 

��Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.�� 

Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet. 

��Look at page two.�� 

Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had when handling 
Secrets of the Darkest Art. 

��Muggle-born Register!�� she read aloud. ����The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-
called ��Muggle-borns�� the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets. 

����Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be 
passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry 
exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or 
force. 

����The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has 
issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the 
newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.���� 

��People won��t let this happen,�� said Ron. 

��150ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It is happening, Ron,�� said Lupin. ��Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.�� 

��But how are they supposed to have 'stolen' magic?�� said Ron. ��It��s mental, if you could steal 
magic there wouldn��t be any Squibs, would there?�� 

��I know,�� said Lupin. ��Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close 
Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must 
suffer the punishment.�� 

Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, ��What if purebloods and halfbloods swear a Muggle-born��s 
part of their family? I��ll tell everyone Hermione��s my cousin �C�� 

Hermione covered Ron��s hand with hers and squeezed it. ��Thank you, Ron, but I couldn��t let 
you �C�� 

��You won��t have a choice,�� said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. ��I��ll teach you my family 
tree so you can answer questions on it.�� 

Hermione gave a shaky laugh. 

��Ron, as we��re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don��t 
think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What��s Voldemort planning for 
Hogwarts?�� she asked Lupin. 

��Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,�� he replied. ��That was 
announced yesterday. It��s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly 
every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to 
teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the 
whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it��s also another way of 
weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status �C meaning that they have 
proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent �C before they are allowed to attend.�� 

Harry felt sickened and angry. At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over 
stacks of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps 
never see their families again either. 

��It��s ... it��s ...�� he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, 

but Lupin said quietly, ��I know.�� 

Lupin hesitated. 

��I��ll understand if you can��t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that

��151ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Dumbledore left you a mission.�� 

��He did,�� Harry replied, ��and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they��re coming with me.�� 

��Can you confide in me what the mission is?�� 

Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that 

he could return a different answer. 

��I can��t, Remus, I��m sorry. If Dumbledore didn��t tell you I don��t think I can.�� 

��I thought you��d say that,�� said Lupin, looking disappointed. ��But I might still be of some use to 
you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There 
would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.�� 

Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their 
mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine. 

Hermione, however, looked puzzled. ��But what about Tonks?�� she asked. 

��What about her?�� said Lupin. 

��Well,�� said Hermione, frowning, ��you��re married! How does she feel about you going away 

with us?�� 

��Tonks will be perfectly safe,�� said Lupin, ��She��ll be at her parents�� house.�� 

There was something strange in Lupin��s tone, it was almost cold. There was also something odd 

in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents�� house; she was, after all, a member of the 

Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action. 

��Remus,�� said Hermione tentatively, ��is everything all right ... you know ... between you and �C �� 

��Everything is fine, thank you,�� said Lupin pointedly. 

Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed one, and then 

Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, ��Tonks is going to have a 

baby.�� 

��Oh, how wonderful!�� squealed Hermione. 

��Excellent!�� said Ron enthusiastically. 

��Congratulations,�� said Harry. 

Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, ��So ... do you accept my 
offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he 
appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I

��152ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.�� 

Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry. 

��Just �C just to be clear,�� he said. ��You want to leave Tonks at her parents�� house and come away 
with us?�� 

��She��ll be perfectly safe there, they��ll look after her,�� said Lupin. He spoke with a finality 
bordering on indifference, ��Harry, I��m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.�� 

��Well,�� said Harry slowly, ��I��m not. I��m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why 
you aren��t sticking with your own kid, actually.�� 

Lupin��s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. 
Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione��s eyes 
swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin. 

��You don��t understand,�� said Lupin at last. 

��Explain, then,�� said Harry. 

Lupin swallowed. 

��I �C I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and have 
regretted it very much every since.�� 

��I see,�� said Harry, ��so you��re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?�� 

Lupin sprang to his feet, His chair toppled over backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that 
Harry saw, for the first time ever, the shadow of the wolf upon his human face. 

��Don��t you understand what I��ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have 
married her. I��ve made her an outcast!�� 

Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. 

��You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore��s protection at 
Hogwarts! You don��t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they 
know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don��t you see what I��ve done? 

��Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to 
marry a werewolf? And the child �C the child �C �� 

Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged. 

��My kind don��t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it �C how can I forgive 

myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by

��153ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of 
whom it must always be ashamed!�� 

��Remus!�� whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. ��Don��t say that �C how could any child be 
ashamed of you?�� 

��Oh, I don��t know, Hermione,�� said Harry. ��I��d be pretty ashamed of him.�� 

Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too. 

Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him. 

��If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,�� Harry said, ��what will they do to a half-
werewolf whose father��s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and 
you reckon he��d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?�� 

��How �C how dare you?�� said Lupin. ��This is not about a desire for �C for danger or personal 
glory �C how dare you suggest such a �C�� 

��I think you��re feeling a bit of a daredevilͦ������ ,�� Harry said, ��You fancy stepping into 
Sirius��s shoes �C�� 

��Harry, no!�� Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin��s livid face. 

��I��d never have believed this,�� Harry said. ��The man who taught me to fight dementors �C a 

coward.�� 

Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang 
and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to 
the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin��s cloak disappearing around the door. 

��Remus, Remus, come back!�� Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they 

heard the front door slam. 

��Harry!�� wailed Hermione. ��How could you?�� 

��It was easy,�� said Harry. He stood up, he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the 

wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking. 

��Don��t look at me like that!�� he snapped at Hermione. 

��Don��t you start on her!�� snarled Ron. 

��No �C no �C we mustn��t fight!�� said Hermione, launching herself between them. 

��You shouldn��t have said that stuff to Lupin,�� Ron told Harry. 

��He had it coming to him,�� said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind,

��154ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and 

his mother��s voice, begging for mercy ... 

��Parents,�� said Harry, ��shouldn��t leave their kids unless �C unless they��ve got to.�� 

��Harry �C�� said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked 
away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that 
fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin��s tortured 
white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron 
nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, 
communicating silently. 

He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other. 

��I know I shouldn��t have called him a coward.�� 

��No, you shouldn��t,�� said Ron at once. 

��But he��s acting like one.�� 

��All the same ...�� said Hermione. 

��I know,�� said Harry. ��But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it��ll be worth it, won��t it?�� 

He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry 
looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had 
said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend? 

The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and 
Hermione��s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the 
table, Harry��s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat 
down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words; his mind 
was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed 
their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and 
Dumbledore��s name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the 
photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words, The 
Dumbledore family, left to right, Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra, and 
Aberforth. 

His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore��s father, Percival, 
was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The

��155ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

baby, Ariana, was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother, 
Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry 
thought of photos of Native Americans he��d seen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, 
and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore 
matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several 
years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus��s nose had 
been broken and before he started wearing glasses. 

The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the newspaper. Baby 
Ariana��s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the picture and saw the 
headline, 

EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM UPCOMING 
BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 
by Rita Skeeter 

Thinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry began to read, 

Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold 
after her husband Percival��s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She 
therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric��s Hollow, the village that was 
later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter��s strange escape from You-Know-Who. 

Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric��s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, 
but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about her husband��s crime 
she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new 
Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family was left well alone. 

��Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of 
homemade Cauldron Cakes,�� says Bathilda Bagshot. ��The first year they were there I only ever 
saw the two boys. Wouldn��t have known there was a daughter if I hadn��t been picking 
Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out 
into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took 
her back inside. Didn��t know what to make of it.��

��156ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric��s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to 
hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing 
was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is 
the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody 
now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It 
seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter��s existence rather than 
suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends 
and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The 
tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana��s existence could be counted upon to 
keep the secret, including her two brothers, who had deflected awkward questions with the 
answer their mother had taught them. ��My sister is too frail for school.��

 Next week, Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts �C the Prizes and the Pretense. 

Harry had been wrong. What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He looked back at 
the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to 
go to Godric��s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him, he wanted to visit the 
place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the 
newspaper, to ask Ron��s and Hermione��s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the 
kitchen. 

For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His immediate thought 
was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of 
struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feet as 
Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, ��Kreacher has returned with the 
thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.��

 Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him. 
��Expelliarmus!�� 
Mundungus��s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived 


for the stairs. Ron rugby-tackled (bring down (as in football) him and Mundungus hit the stone 
floor with a muffled crunch. 
��What?�� he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron��s grip. ��Wha��ve I 
done? Setting a bleedin�� house-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha��ve I done, lemme go,

��157ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

lemme go, or �C�� 

��You��re not in much of a position to make threats,�� said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, 
crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped 
struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand 
deliberately at Mundungus��s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair 
was matted and his robes stained. 

��Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,�� croaked the elf. ��Fletcher 
knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher 
cornered the thief in the end.��

 ��You��ve done really well, Kreacher,�� said Harry, and the elf bowed low. 

 ��Right, we��ve got a few questions for you,�� Harry told Mundungus, who shouted at once. 

��I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never volunteered to 
die for you, an�� that was bleedin�� You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta 

there. I said all along I didn��t wanna do it �C��

 ��For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,�� said Hermione. 

��Well, you��re a bunch of bleedin' 'eroes then, aren��t you, but I never pretended I was up for 

killing meself �C�� 

��We��re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,�� said Harry, moving his wand a little 
closer to Mundungus��s baggy, bloodshot eyes. ��We already knew you were an unreliable bit of 
scum.�� 

��Well then, why the 'ell am I being 'unted down by 'ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblets 
again? I ain��t got none of 'em left, or you could 'ave 'em �C�� 

��It��s not about the goblets either, although you��re getting warmer,�� said Harry. ��Shut up and 
listen.�� 

It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand some small 
portion of truth. Harry��s wand was now so close to the bridge of Mundungus��s nose that 
Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. 

��When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,�� Harry began, but Mundungus 
interrupted him again.

 ��Sirius never cared about any of the junk �C��

��158ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

There was the sound of pattering (sound of footsteps) feet, a blaze of shining copper, an 
echoing clang, and a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the 
head with a saucepan. 

��Call 'im off, call 'im off, 'e should be locked up!�� screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher 

raised the heavy-bottomed pan again.

 ��Kreacher, no!�� shouted Harry.

 Kreacher��s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft.

 ��Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?��

 Ron laughed. 

��We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the honors,�� said 
Harry. 

��Thank you very much, Master,�� said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, 
his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. 

��When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,�� Harry began again, ��you 
took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.�� Harry��s mouth was 
suddenly dry. He could sense Ron and Hermione��s tension and excitement too. ��What did you do 
with it?��

 ��Why?�� asked Mundungus. ��Is it valuable?��

 ��You��ve still got it!�� cried Hermione. 

��No, he hasn��t,�� said Ron shrewdly. ��He��s wondering whether he should have asked more 
money for it.�� 

��More?�� said Mundungus. ��That wouldn��t have been effing (Slang) damned difficult ... 

bleedin�� gave it away, di��n�� I? No choice.��

 ��What do you mean?�� 

��I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I��ve got a license for trading 

in magical artifacts. Bleedin�� snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an�� 

told me she��d take it and let me off that time, and to fink (inform) meself lucky.��

 ��Who was this woman?�� asked Harry. 

��I dunno, some Ministry hag.�� Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. ��Little 

woman. Bow on top of 'er head.��

��159ҳ��

He frowned and then added, ��Looked like a toad.�� 

Harry dropped his wand, It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, 
which ignited. 

��Aquamenti!�� screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulfing a 
spluttering and choking Mundungus. 

Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron��s and Hermione��s faces. The scars on 
the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again.

Chapter Twelve 

Magic is Might 

As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the 


middle of 
Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle 

and brown. 
The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by 

anyone in 
the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve itself. 

The 
muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since 

accepted 
the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number 
thirteen. 

And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly 
most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with 
no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and 
thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days 
running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners 
who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of 
them might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat. 

The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Occasionally one of 
them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back 
looking disappointed. 

On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. 
Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and 
thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, 
bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of 
those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with 
the twisted face pointed and his closest companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a 
moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and 
disappointed. 

Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly lost his

��161ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death 
Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door 
carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along 
the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet 
clutched in his hand. 

The usual low whisper of ��Severus Snape�� greeted him, the chill wind swept him, and his 
tongue rolled up for a moment. 

��I didn��t kill you,�� he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure 
exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. 
Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, ��I��ve got news, and you won��t like it.�� 

The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone; Copper pots and pans had 
been burnished (polish) to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates 
already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was 
simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically different than the house-elf who 
now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean and fluffy 
as cotton woolԭ��, Regulus��s locket bouncing on his thin chest. 

��Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,�� croaked Kreacher, 
seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number 
of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered. 

��What��s happened?�� Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf 
of scribbled notes and hand drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now 
they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their 
scattered parchment. 

A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a 
headline that read, 

SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER 

��No!�� said Ron and Hermione loudly. 

Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying 
story out loud. 

��162ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry, 
was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient 
school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take 
over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts 
professor.�� 

����I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values �C ��Like 
committing murder and cutting off people��s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in 
Dumbledore��s study �C Merlin��s pants!�� she shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt 
up from the table and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, ��I��ll be back in a minute!�� 

����Merlin��s pants��?�� repeated Ron, looking amused. ��She must be upset.�� He pulled the 
newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape. 

��The other teachers won��t stand for this, McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the 
truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won��t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are 
these Carrows?�� 

��Death Eaters,�� said Harry. ��There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the 
tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it��s all friends together. And,�� Harry went on bitterly, 
drawing up a chair, ��I can��t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the 
Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it��ll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice 
few years in Azkaban �C and that��s if they��re lucky. I reckon they��ll stay to try and protect the 
students.�� 

Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands, and ladled out soup into 
pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so. 

��Thanks, Kreacher,�� said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape��s 
face. ��Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.�� 

He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher��s cooking had improved 
dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus��s locket. Today��s French onion was as good as 
Harry had ever tasted. 

��There are still a load of Death Eaters watching this house,�� he told Ron as he ate, ��more than 
usual. It��s like they��re hoping we��ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the 
Hogwarts Express.��

��163ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Ron glanced at his watch. 

��I��ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn��t 
it?�� 

In his mind��s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once 
followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure 
Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, 
and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape��s new regime.

 ��They nearly saw me coming back in just now,�� Harry said, ��I landed badly on the top step, and 
the Cloak slipped.�� 

��I do that every time. Oh, here she is,�� Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch 
Hermione reentering the kitchen. ��And what in the name of Merlin��s most baggy Y Fronts was that 
about?��

 ��I remembered this,�� Hermione panted. 

She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her 
small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting 
inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag, within a few 
seconds it had vanished, like so much ease, into the bag��s capacious depths. 

��Phineas Nigellus,�� Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the 
usual sonorous, clanking crash. 

��Sorry?�� said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was 
able to travel between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster��s 
office at Hogwarts, the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in 
triumphant possession of Dumbledore��s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone 
Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor. 

��Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,�� Hermione explained to 
Ron as she resumed her seat. ��But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the 
inside of my handbag.��

 ��Good thinking!�� said Ron, looking impressed. 

��Thank you,�� smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. ��So, Harry, what else happened 
today?��

��164ҳ��

��Nothing,�� said Harry. ��Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw 
your dad though, Ron. He looks fine.�� 

Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try 
and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was 
always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring to catch these glimpses 
of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious. 

��Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,�� Ron said. 
��That��s why we haven��t seen Umbridge, she��d never walk, she��d think she��s too important.�� 

��And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?�� Hermione 
asked. 

 ��Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,�� said Ron. 

��How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?�� Hermione asked, her soupspoon 

suspended in midair.

 ��Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.��

 ��But you never told us that!�� 

Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and 
Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen. 

��There��s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!�� she said, flipping feverishly through 
the pages. 

 ��Well, does it really matter?�� 

��Ron, it all matters! If we��re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when 
they��re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We��ve been over and 
over this, I mean, what��s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren��t even bothering to 
tell us �C��

 ��Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing �C �� 

��You do realize, don��t you, that there��s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world 
for us to be right now than the Ministry of �C��

 ��I think we should do it tomorrow,�� said Harry.

 Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup. 

 ��Tomorrow?�� repeated Hermione. ��You aren��t serious, Harry?��

��165ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I am,�� said Harry. ��I don��t think we��re going to be much better prepared than we are now even 
if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther 
away that locket could be. There��s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing 
doesn��t open.��

 ��Unless,�� said Ron, ��she��s found a way of opening it and she��s now possessed.��

 ��Wouldn��t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,�� Harry shrugged. 

 Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought. 

��We know everything important,�� Harry went on, addressing Hermione. ��We know they��ve 
stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members 
are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two 
Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge��s office is, because of 
what you heard the bearded bloke saying to his mate �C��

 ����I��ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,���� Hermione recited immediately. 

��Exactly,�� said Harry. ��And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or 
whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend �C ��

 ��But we haven��t got any!��

 ��If the plan works, we will have,�� Harry continued calmly. 

��I don��t know, Harry, I don��t know ... There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so 
much relies on chance ...�� 

��That��ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,�� said Harry. ��It��s time to 
act.�� 

He could tell from Ron��s and Hermione��s faces that they were scared; he was not particularly 
confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation. 

They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy 
on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since 
childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, 
and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the 
same time every day. Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of 
somebody��s briefcase. Slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of 
Hermione.

��166ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��All right,�� said Ron slowly, ��let��s say we go for it tomorrow ... I think it should just be me and 

Harry.��

 ��Oh, don��t start that again!�� sighed Hermione. ��I thought we��d settled this.�� 

��It��s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different. Hermione,�� 
Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously. ��You��re on the list 
of Muggle-borns who didn��t present themselves for interrogation!�� 

��And you��re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If anyone shouldn��t go, it��s 
Harry, he��s got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head �C��

 ��Fine, I��ll stay here,�� said Harry. ��Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won��t you?�� 

As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry��s forehead. His hand 
jumped to it. He saw Hermione��s eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing 
his hair out of his eyes. 

��Well, if all three of us go, we��ll have to Disapparate separately,�� Ron was saying. ��We can��t 
all fit under the Cloak anymore.�� 

Harry��s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried 
forward. 

��Master has not finished his soup, would master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart 
to which Master is so partial?��

 ��Thanks, Kreacher, but I��ll be back in a minute �C er �C bathroom.�� 

Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and 
then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting 
with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and 
closed his eyes ... . 

He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, timbered 
gables; they looked like gingerbread houses. He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness 
of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a mounting excitement ... 

The door opened. A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into Harry��s face, 

humor gone, terror replacing it.

 ��Gregorovitch?�� said a high, cold voice. 

She shook her head. She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, prevented

��167ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

her shutting him out ... 

 ��I want Gregorovitch.�� 

��Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!�� she cried, shaking her head. ��He no live here! He no live here! I 
know him not!�� 

Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark hall, and 
Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand. 

 ��Where is he?��

 ��Das weiff ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!�� 

He raised his hand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. She tried to 

shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light �C 

 ��Harry! HARRY!��

 He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on the door again.

 ��Harry, open up!�� 

He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at 

once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking 

unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.

 ��What were you doing?�� asked Hermione sternly.

 ��What d��you think I was doing?�� asked Harry with feeble bravado��������. 

 ��You were yelling your head off!�� said Ron. 

 ��Oh yeah ... I must��ve dozed off or �C�� 

��Harry, please don��t insult our intelligence,�� said Hermione, taking deep breaths. ��We know 

your scar hurt downstairs, and you��re white as a sheet.��

 Harry sat down on the edge of the bath. 

��Fine. I��ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he��s probably killed her whole 

family. And he didn��t need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there ...�� 

��Harry, you aren��t supposed to let this happen anymore!�� Hermione cried, her voice echoing 
through the bathroom. ��Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! HE thought the connection 
was dangerous �C Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how 
can it help?��

 ��Because it means I know what he��s doing,�� said Harry.

��168ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��So you��re not even going to try to shut him out?��

 ��Hermione, I can��t. You know I��m lousy at Occlumency. I never got the hang of it.�� 

��You never really tried!�� she said hotly. ��I don��t get it, Harry �C do you like having this special 
connection or relationship or what �C whatever �C��

 She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up. 

 ��Like it?�� he said quietly. ��Would you like it?��

 ��I �C no �C I��m sorry, Harry. I just didn��t mean �C�� 

��I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he��s most 

dangerous. But I��m going to use it.��

 ��Dumbledore �C�� 

��Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else��s. I want to know why he��s after 

Gregorovitch.��

 ��Who?�� 

��He��s a foreign wandmaker,�� said Harry. ��He made Krum��s wand and Krum reckons he��s 
brilliant.�� 

��But according to you,�� said Ron, ��Voldemort��s got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he��s 
already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?�� 

��Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better ... or else he thinks 
Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me, because 
Ollivander didn��t know.�� 

Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical 
looks behind his back. 

��Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,�� said Hermione, ��but you made it happen! 
Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?�� 

��Because I know it wasn��t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really 
happened!�� 

They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was 
marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was 
permitting himself to see into Voldemort��s mind. 

To his relief, Ron intervened.

��169ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Drop it,�� he advised her. ��It��s up to him. And if we��re going to the Ministry tomorrow, don��t 
you reckon we should go over the plan?�� 

Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though Harry was quite 
sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement 
kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart. 

They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan 
until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. 

Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius��s room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained��׼ on 
the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for 
another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice 
Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he though of 
Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort 
sought him so determinedly.

 Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.

 ��You look terrible,�� was Ron��s greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry.

 ��Not for long,�� said Harry, yawning. 

They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and hot rolls by 
Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review. 

��Robes,�� she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and 
continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, ��Polyjuice Potion ... Invisibiliity Cloak ... Decoy 
Detonators ... You should each take a couple just in case ... Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Norgat, 
Extendable Ears ...�� 

They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and 
promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned. 

��Bless him,�� said Ron fondly, ��and when you think I used to fantasize about cutting off his 
head and sticking it on the wall.�� 

They made their way onto the front step with immense caution. They could see a couple of 
puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square. 

 Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry. 

After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny

��170ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, 
except for a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not usually appear here until at 
least eight o��clock. 

��Right then,�� said Hermione, checking her watch. ��she ought to be here in about five minutes. 
When I��ve Stunned her �C�� 

��Hermione, we know,�� said Ron sternly. ��And I thought we were supposed to open the door 
before she got here?��

 Hermione squealed. ��I nearly forgot! Stand back �C�� 

She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door (emergency exist) beside 
them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their 
careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make it 
look as thought it was still closed. 

��And now,�� she said, turning back to face the other two in the alleyway, ��we put on the Cloak 
again �C��

 ����and we wait,�� Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione��s head like a blanket over a birdcage 
and rolling his eyes at Harry. 

Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway 
gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness, the sun had just 
come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, 
before Hermione��s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over. 

��Nicely done, Hermione,�� said Ron, emerging behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry 
took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that 
led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch��s head and added them to a flask of 
muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little 
witch��s handbag. 

��She��s Mafalda Hopkirk,�� he said, reading a small card that identified their victim as an 
assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. ��You��d better take this, Hermione, and here are the 
tokens.�� 

He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., which he had 
taken from the witch��s purse. 

��171ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, and within 
seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda��s spectacles 
and put them on, Harry checked his watch. 

 ��We��re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.�� 

They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda. Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak 
over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, 
and a small, ferrety looking wizard appeared before them.

 ��Oh, hello, Mafalda.��

 ��Hello!�� said Hermione in a quavery voice, ��How are you today?��

 ��Not so good, actually,�� replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast. 

 As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them. 

��I��m sorry to hear you��re under the weather,�� said Hermione, talking firmly over the little 
wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the 

street. ��Here, have a sweet.��

 ��Eh? Oh, no thanks �C��

 ��I insist!�� said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. 

Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one. 

The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the little wizard 
started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from 
the top of his head. 

��Oh dear!�� she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. ��Perhaps you��d better take the day 
off!�� 

��No �C no!�� He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk 
straight. ��I must �C today �C must go �C�� 

��But that��s just silly!�� said Hermione, alarmed. ��You can��t go to work in this state �C I think you 
ought to go to St. Mungo��s and get them to sort you out.�� 

The wizard had collapsed, heaving��Ϣ ,��� , onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the 
main street.

 ��You simply can��t go to work like this!�� cried Hermione. 

At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a repulsed Hermione to claw his way

��172ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the 
bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit. 

��Urgh,�� said Hermione, holding up the skirt�°� ,��Ե of her robe to avoid the puddles of 
sick. ��It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.�� 

��Yeah,�� said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard��s bag, ��but I still think a 
whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn��t 
he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.�� 

Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and 
wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag. 

��Weird he wasn��t wearing them today, wasn��t it, seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, 
I��m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.�� 

��Now wait here,�� Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, ��and we��ll 
be back with some hairs for you.�� 

He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in the sick-
splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione 
reappeared. 

��We don��t know who he is,�� Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black hairs, ��but he��s 
gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he��s pretty tall, you��ll need bigger robes ...�� 

She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take 
the potion and change. 

Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, from what he 
could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the 
Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two. 

 ��Blimey, that��s scary,�� said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him.

 ��Take one of Mafalda��s tokens,�� Hermione told Harry, ��and let��s go, it��s nearly nine.�� 

They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were 
spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs, one labeled GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. 

��See you in a moment, then,�� said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to 
LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to 
be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white.

��173ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Morning, Reg!�� called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by 
inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. ��Blooming pain in the bum (British slang) 
buttocks, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry 
Potter?�� 

The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. ��Yeah,�� he said, 

��stupid, isn��t it?��

 And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. 

To Harry��s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and peered through the 

gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet 

next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him.

 ��We have to flush ourselves in?�� he whispered. 

 ��Looks like it,�� Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly.

 They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet. 

He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he appeared to be standing in water, 
his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment 
had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic. 

He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. The great 
Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the 
center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. 
Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this vast 
sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry 
workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the 
statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT. 

Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs. Another wizard had just flown out of the 

fireplace behind him.

 ��Out of the way, can��t y �C oh, sorry, Runcorn.�� 

Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man who Harry was 
impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating. 

��Psst!�� said a voice, and he looked around to see a whispy little witch and the ferrety wizard 
from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join

��174ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

them.

 ��You got in all right, then?�� Hermione whispered to Harry.

 ��No, he��s still stuck in the hog,�� said Ron. 

��Oh, very funny ... It��s horrible, isn��t it?�� she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue. 

��Have you seen what they��re sitting on?�� 

Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved 
thrones were actually mounds of carved humans, hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, 
women and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the 
weight of the handsomely robed wizards. 

 ��Muggles,�� whispered Hermione, ��In their rightful place. Come on, let��s get going.�� 

They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the 
hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of 
Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were 
forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest 
one when a voice said, ��Cattermole!�� 

They looked around, Harry��s stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed 
Dumbledore��s death was striding toward them. The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their 
eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The man��s scowling, slightly brutish 
face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with 
much gold thread. 

Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically, ��Morning, Yaxley!�� Yaxley 
ignored them. 

��I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, Cattermole. It��s still 
raining in there.��

 Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody spoke. 

 ��Raining ... in your office? That��s �C that��s not good, is it?��

 Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley��s eyes widened. ��You think it��s funny, Cattermole, do you?��

 A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off. 

 ��No,�� said Ron, ��no, of course �C�� 

��You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I��m

��175ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

quite surprised you��re not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a 
bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.�� 

Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She cough feebly and 
turned away.

 ��I �C I �C�� stammered Ron. 

��But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,�� said Yaxley, ����not that any woman I 
married would ever be mistaken for such filth �C and the Head of Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do this job, Cattermole. Do you 
understand me?��

 ��Yes,�� whispered Ron. 

��Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an hour, your 
wife��s Blood Status will be in even greater doubt than it is now.�� 

The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who 
was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward 
another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them. It was as if they 
were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward. 

��What am I going to do?�� Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. ��If I don��t turn 
up, my wife ... I mean, Cattermole��s wife �C�� 

��We��ll come with you, we should stick together �C�� began Harry, but Ron shook his head 
feverishly. 

��That��s mental, we haven��t got much time. You two find Umbridge, I��ll go and sort out 
Yaxley��s office �C but how do I stop a raining?�� 

��Try Finite Incantatem,�� said Hermione at once, ��that should stop the rain if it��s a hex or curse; 
if it doesn��t something��s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to 
fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings �C�� 

��Say it again, slowly �C�� said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, but at that 
moment the lift juddered (shudder) to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, ��Level four, 
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and 
Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau,�� and the grilles slid open 
again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around

��176ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.

 ��Morning, Albert,�� said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He glanced over at Ron and 
Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more; Hermione was now whispering frantic 
instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttering ��Dirk Cresswell, eh? 
From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I��m pretty confident I��ll get his job now!�� 

He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; the grilles 
opened once more. 

��Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic 
Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services,�� said the disembodied 
witch��s voice. 

Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed by the other 
wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione 
said, very fast, ��Actually, Harry, I think I��d better go after him, I don��t think he knows what he��s 
doing and if he gets caught the whole thing �C��

 ��Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.��

 The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood before them, two of 
them deep in conversation, a long-haired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and 
a squat, toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her 
chest.

Chapter Thirteen 
The Muggle-Born Registration Commission 


��Ah, Mafalda!�� said Umbridge, looking at 


Hermione. 

��Travers sent you, did he?��

 ��Y-yes,�� squeaked Hermione. 

��God, you��ll do perfectly well.�� Umbridge 

spoke to the 
wizard in black and gold. ��That��s that 

problem 
solved. Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for 

record-keeping 
we shall be able to start straightaway.�� She 

consulted her 
clipboard. ��Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut... even 
here, in the heart of the Ministry!�� She stepped into the lift besides Hermione, as did the two 
wizards who had been listening to Umbridge��s conversation with the Minister. ��We��ll go straight 
down, Mafalda, you��ll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, aren��t 
you getting out?��

 ��Yes, of course,�� said Harry in Runcorn��s deep voice. 

Harry stepped out of the life. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. Glancing over his 
shoulder, Harry saw Hermione��s anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side 
of her, Umbridge��s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. 

��What brings you here, Runcorn?�� asked the new Minister of Magic. His long black hair and 
beard were streaked with silver and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, 
putting Harry in the mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock. 

��Needed a quick word with,�� Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, ��Arthur Weasley. 

Someone said he was up on level one.��

 ��Ah,�� said Plum Thicknesse. ��Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?��

 ��No,�� said Harry, his throat dry. ��No, nothing like that.�� 

��Ah, well. It��s only a matter of time,�� said Thicknesse. ��If you ask me, the blood traitors are as 

bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.��

 ��Good day, Minister.�� 

Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The moment the

��178ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy 
black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. Runcorn 
was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden. 

Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming 
wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner��s name and occupation upon it, the 
might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself upon him so that 
the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks 
seemed laughably childish. They had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being 
detected. They had not given a moment��s thought to what they would do if they were forced to 
separate. 

Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was 
struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman��s liberty possibly depending 
on the outcome, and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly 
well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift. 

He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The silence pressed 
upon him. There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here, the purple-carpeted corridors were 
as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the place. 

Her office must be up here, Harry thought. 

It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but on the other 
hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off along the corridor again, 
passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in 
front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment. 

Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway along the next 
corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at 
small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. 
Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. They were all waving and 
twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like 
little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, 
that the papers all formed the same pattern and after a few more seconds he realized what he was

��179ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

watching was the creation of pamphlets �C that the paper squares were pages, which, when 
assembled, folded and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. 

Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he 
doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the 
pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink cover was 
emblazoned with a golden title, 

MUDBLOODS 

and the Dangers They Pose to 
a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society 

Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals, 
being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no author��s name upon the 
pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. 
Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her 
wand, ��Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?�� 

��Careful,�� said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and 

fell to the floor. 

 ��What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?��

 The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; 
Harry looked too, and the rage reared in him like a snake. Where there might have been a peephole 
on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris��Ĥ had been set into the wood 

�C an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody. 
For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there. He even forgot that 
he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving. It 
gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read, 

Dolores Umbridge 
Senior Undersecretary to the Minister


 Below that a slightly shinier new plaque read, 
Head of the Muggle-Born 
Registration Commission

Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers. Though they were intent upon their work, he 
could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of 
them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a 
rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator 
on the ground. 

It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him. A few 
moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud 
bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner. The young witch in the front row 
shrieked. Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the 
source of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge��s office, and closed 
the door behind him. 

He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge��s office at Hogwarts. 
Lace draperies, doilies and dried flowers covered every surface. The walls bore the same 
ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, be-ribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with 
sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy���Ժ�Ҷ�� , flowered cloth. Behind 
Mad-eye��s eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side 
of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy 
Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical 
eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. The he turned to face the room again, raised his wand, 
and murmured, ��Accio Locket.�� 

Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge knew all about protective 
charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open all the drawers. 
He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their 
drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no 
sign of a locket. 

There was a filing cabinet behind the desk, Harry set to searching it. Like Filch��s filing cabinet 
at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the 
bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from the search: Mr. Weasley's file.

 He pulled it out and opened it.

Arthur Weasley 



BLOOD STATUS: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle leanings. Known member of 
the Order of the Phoenix 

FAMILY: Wife (pureblood), seven children, two youngest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest 
son currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have 
confirmed. 

SECURITY STATUS: TRACKED. All movements are being 
monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will 
contact (has stayed with Weasley family previously) 

��Undesirable Number One,�� Harry muttered under his breath as he replaced Mr. Weasley��s 
folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he 
straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places he saw a poster of himself on 
the wall, with the words UNDESIRABLE NO. 1 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note 
was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and saw that 
Umbridge had written, ��To be punished.�� 

Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried 
flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the office one last 
sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small 
rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk. 

Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized that the moment he touched it 
that it was not a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy 
book. Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat �C The Life and Lies 
of Albus Dumbledore �C nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest, ��by Rita Skeeter, 
bestselling author of Armando Dippet, Master or Moron?�� 

Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys, both

��182ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

laughing immoderately with their arms around each other��s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with 
elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum��s chin that had so 
annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild 
look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a 
young Doge, but before he could check the caption, the door of the office opened. 

If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had 
time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have 
caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he remained quite still, staring 
curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps deciding that that all he had seen 
was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily replaced it 
upon the shelf. Thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing 
ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly 
daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond. 

The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy Detonator, which 
continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, ��I 
bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they��re so careless, remember that poisonous 
duck?�� 

Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never been likely that the 
locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of 
Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to be to leave the 
Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another day. The first thing to do was to find 
Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom. 

The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak as it 
started its descent. To his enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and 
wild-eyed Ron got in.

 ��M-morning,�� he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again.

 ��Ron, it��s me, Harry!��

 ��Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like �C why isn��t Hermione with you?��

 ��She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn��t refuse, and �C�� 

But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again. The doors opened and Mr. Weasley

��183ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased (pull hair away from scalp 

and comb towards the head in order to make hair look thicker) so high it resembled an anthill.

 ��... I quite understand what you��re saying, Wakanda, but I��m afraid I cannot be party to �C�� 

Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have Mr. Weasley glare at 
him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once 
more. 

��Oh hello, Reg,�� said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady dripping from Ron��s 
robes. ��Isn��t your wife in for questioning today? Er �C what��s happened to you? Why are you so 
wet?�� 

��Yaxley��s office is raining,�� said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley��s shoulder, and Harry felt 
sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each other��s 
eyes. ��I couldn��t stop it, so they��ve sent me to get Bernie �C Pillsworth, I think they said �C�� 

��Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,�� said Mr. Weasley. ��Did you try Meterolojinx 

Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.��

 ��Meteolojinx Recanto?�� whispered Ron. ��No, I didn��t. Thanks, D �C I mean, thanks, Arthur.�� 

The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left, and Ron darted past her out of 
sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, 
his nose buried in some papers he was reading. 

Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lift with his father. He 
glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened 
again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. 
Weasley��s arm.

 ��One moment, Runcorn.��

 The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weasley said, ��I hear you had 
information about Dirk Cresswell.�� 

Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley��s anger was no less because of the brush with 
Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid. 

 ��Sorry?�� he said. 

 ��Don��t pretend, Runcorn,�� said Mr. Weasley fiercely. ��You tracked down the wizard who faked 

his family tree, didn��t you?��

��184ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I �C so what if I did?�� said Harry. 

��So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,�� said Mr. Weasley quietly, as the lift sank 
ever lower. ��And if he survives Azkaban, you��ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, 
his sons, and his friends -��

 ��Arthur,�� Harry interrupted, ��you know you��re being tracked, don��t you?��

 ��Is that a threat, Runcorn?�� said Mr. Weasley loudly.

 ��No,�� said Harry, ��it��s a fact! They��re watching your every move �C�� 

The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave Harry a scathing look 
and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he was impersonating somebody 
other than Runcorn. The lift doors clanged shut. 

Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try to extricate Hermione 
on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining office. When the doors opened, he stepped out 
into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the wood-paneled and carpeted corridors 
above. As the lift rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door 
that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries. 

He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on the left hand 
side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. His mind grappled with 
possibilities as he crept down them. He still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it 
would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick 
word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important to get 
away with this, and even if he managed it, Hermione��s non-reappearance might trigger a search 
before they were clear of the Ministry. 

Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him, 
as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took; a 
cold that reached right down his throat and tore at his lungs. And then he felt that stealing sense of 
despair, or hopelessness, filling him, expanding inside him. 

Dementors, he thought. 

And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene. The dark 
passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black-hooded figures, their faces completely 
hidden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petrified Muggle-borns brought in

��185ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their 
faces in their hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors�� 
greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by families, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding 
up and down in front of them, and the cold, the hopelessness and the despair of the place laid 
themselves upon Harry like a curse. 

Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here without 
revealing himself instantly. So he moved forward as silently as he could, and with every step he 
took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of 
Ron, who needed him. 

Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying. The eyeless faces hidden beneath 
their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human 
presence that still had some hope, some resilience. 

And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon doors on the left 
of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it. 

"No, no, I��m half-blood, I��m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard, he was, look him 
up, Arkie Alderton, he��s a well known broomstick designer, look him up, I tell you �C get your 
hands off me, get your hands off �C" 

��This is your final warning,�� said Umbridge��s soft voice, magically magnified so that it 
sounded clearly over the man��s desperate screams. ��If you struggle, you will be subjected to the 
Dementor��s Kiss.��

 The man��s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor. 

 ��Take him away,�� said Umbridge. 

Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting, scabbed hands 
clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting. They glided away down the 
corridor with him, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight.

 ��Next �C Mary Cattermole,�� called Umbridge. 

A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot. Her dark hair was smoothed 
back into a bun and she wore long plain robes. Her face was completely bloodless. As she passed 
the dementors, Harry saw her shudder. 

He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her walking alone

��186ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

into the dungeon. As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her. 

It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic. 
This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic�ıտ�
��֢ sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well. 

There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; they stood like 
faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade��
��, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, quite as white-faced as Mrs. 
Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform, a bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up 
and down, up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was there to protect the 
prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors. 

That was for the accused to feel, not the accusers. 

��Sit down,�� said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice. 

Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised 
platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her 

there. 

��You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?�� asked Umbridge. 

Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod. 

��Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department?�� 

Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears. ��I don��t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!�� 

Umbridge ignored her. ��Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?�� 

Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever. ��They��re frightened, they think I might not come 

home -��

 ��Spare us,�� spat Yaxley. ��The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies.�� 

Mrs. Cattermole��s sobs masked Harry��s footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps 
that led up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat 
patrolled, he felt the change in temperature. It was warm and comfortable here. The Patronus, he 
was sure, was Umbridge��s, and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here, in her element, 
upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. 

Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and 
Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making Hermione jump. He

��187ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word 
might cause Hermione alarm. 

Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance.

 ��I��m behind you,�� he whispered into Hermione��s ear. 

As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which 
she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating 
upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed. 

��A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole,�� 
Umbridge was saying. ��Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you 
recognize the description?��

 Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve.

 ��Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?�� 

��T-took?�� sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. ��I didn��t t-take it from anybody. I b-bought it when I was 
eleven years old. It �C it �C it �C chose me.��

 She cried harder than ever. 

Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She leaned forward 
over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold swung forward too, and 
dangled over the void, the locket. 

Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still intent upon 
their prey, were deaf to everything else. 

��No,�� said Umbridge, ��no, I don��t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose witches or 
wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here �C 
Mafalda, pass them to me.�� 

Umbridge held out a small hand. She looked so toadlike at that moment that Harry was quite 
surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermione��s hands were shaking with shock. 
She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf 
of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole��s name on it. 

��That��s �C that��s pretty, Dolores,�� she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds 
of Umbridge��s blouse. 

��What?�� snapped Umbridge, glancing down. ��Oh yes �C an old family heirloom,�� she said,

��188ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

patting the locket lying on her large bosom. ��The S stands for Selwyn. I am related to the Selwyns. 
Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related. A pity,�� she continued in a 
louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole��s questionnaire, ��that the same cannot be said for 
you. 'Parents' professions, greengrocers'.�� 

Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the dementors 
stood waiting in the corners. 

It was Umbridge��s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry��s brain and obliterated his 
sense of caution �C that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to 
bolster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed 
beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, ��Stupefy!�� 

There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the 
balustrade, Mrs. Cattermole��s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, down below, the prowling 
silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind. Yaxley, confused, looked around 
for the source of the trouble and saw Harry��s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried 
to draw his own wand, but too late, ��Stupefy!��

 Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. 

 ��Harry!��

 ��Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend �C��

 ��Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!�� 

Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the dementors had 
moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair, Whether 
because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in 
control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear 
as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back. 

��EXPECTO PATRONUM!�� 

The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry��s wand and leaped toward the dementors, which 
fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stag��s light, more powerful and more 
warming than the cat��s protection, filled the whole dungeon as it cantered around the room.

 ��Get the Horcrux,�� Harry told Hermione. 

He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak into his back, and approached Mrs.

��189ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cattermole. 

��You?�� she whispered, gazing into his face. ��But �C but Reg said you were the one who 
submitted my name for questioning!�� 

��Did I?�� muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms, ��Well, I��ve had a change of 
heart. Diffindo!�� 

Nothing happened. ��Hermione, how do I get rid of these chains?�� 

��Wait, I��m trying something up here �C��

 ��Hermione, we��re surrounded by dementors!�� 

��I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket��s gone �C I need to duplicate it �C 
Geminio! There... That should fool her... .��

 Hermione came running downstairs. 

 ��Let��s see... . Relashio!�� 

The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Cattermole looked just as 

frightened as ever before. 

 ��I don��t understand,�� she whispered. 

��You��re going to leave here with us,�� said Harry, pulling her to her feet. ��Go home, grab your 
children, and get out, get out of the country if you��ve got to. Disguise yourselves and run. You��ve 
seen how it is, you won��t get anything like a fair hearing here.�� 

��Harry,�� said Hermione, ��how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside 
the door?�� 

��Patronuses,�� said Harry, pointing his wand at his own. The stag slowed and walked, still 
gleaming brightly, toward the door. ��As many as we can muster; do yours, Hermione.��

 ��Expec �C Expecto patronum,�� said Hermione. Nothing happened. 

��It��s the only spell she ever has trouble with,�� Harry told a completely bemused Mrs. 
Cattermole. ��Bit unfortunate, really... Come on Hermione... .�� 

"Expecto patronum!" 

A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione��s wand and swam gracefully through the air to 

join the stag. 

 ��C��mon,�� said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door. 

When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people

waiting outside. Harry looked around; the dementors were falling back on both sides of them, 
melding (blend, merge) into the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures. 

��It��s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families,�� Harry 
told the waiting Muggle-born, who were dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering 
slightly. ��Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That��s the �C er �C new official 
position. Now, if you��ll just follow the Patronuses, you��ll be able to leave the Atrium.�� 

They managed to get up the stone stops without being intercepted, but as they approached the 
lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, and otter 
soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not 
help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this unwelcome 
conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them. 

��Reg!�� screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into Ron��s arms. ��Runcorn let me out, 
he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he��s told all of us to leave the country. I think we��d better 
do it, Reg, I really do, let��s hurry home and fetch the children and �C why are you so wet?�� 

��Water,�� muttered Ron, disengaging himself. ��Harry, they know there are intruders inside the 
Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge��s office door. I reckon we��ve got five minutes if 
that �C��

 Hermione��s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to Harry.

 ��Harry, if we��re trapped here �C!�� 

��We won��t be if we move fast,�� said Harry. He addressed the silent group behind them, who 
were all gawping at him.

 ��Who��s got wands?��

 About half of them raised their hands. 

��Okay, all of you who haven��t got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has. We��ll 
need to be fast before they stop us. Come on.�� 

They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry��s Patronus stood sentinel before the 
golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise. 

 ��Level eight,�� said the witch��s cool voice, ��Atrium.�� 

Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people moving from 

fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off.

��Harry!�� squeaked Hermione. ��What are we going to �C?�� 

��STOP!�� Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the Atrium, The 
wizards sealing the fireplaces froze. ��Follow me,�� he whispered to the group of terrified Muggleborns, 
who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and Hermione. 

��What��s up, Albert?�� said the same balding wizard who had followed Harry out of the fireplace 
earlier. He looked nervous. 

��This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,�� said Harry with all the authority he could 
muster.

 The group of wizards in front of him looked at one another.

 ��We��ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone �C�� 

��Are you contradicting me?�� Harry blustered. ��Would you like me to have your family tree 
examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell��s?�� 

��Sorry!�� gasped the balding wizard, backing away. ��I didn��t mean nothing, Albert, but I 
thought... I thought they were in for questioning and...�� 

��Their blood is pure,�� said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall. 
��Purer than many of yours, I daresay. Off you go,�� he boomed to the Muggle-borns, who scurried 
forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some 
looking confused, others scared and fearful. Then:

 ��Mary!�� 

Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer vomiting but 
pale and wan, had just come running out of a lift.

 ��R- Reg?��

 She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.

 The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other. 

 ��Hey �C what��s going on? What is this?��

 ��Seal the exit! SEAL IT!�� 

Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces, 
into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard 
lifted his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, sending him flying through the 
air.

��192ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He��s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!�� Harry shouted. 

The balding wizard��s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. 
Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked 
from Harry to the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed, ��My wife! Who was 
that with my wife? What��s going on?��

 Harry saw Yaxley��s head turn, saw an inkling of truth dawn on that brutish face. 

��Come on!�� Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace 
together as Yaxley��s curse sailed over Harry��s head. They spun for a few seconds before shooting 
up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door, Ron was standing there beside the 
sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole.

 ��Reg, I don��t understand �C��

 ��Let go, I��m not your husband, you��ve got to go home!��

 There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around; Yaxley had just appeared. 

��LET��S GO!�� Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on 
the stop. 

Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing hands, but something was 
wrong. Hermione��s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip. 

He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not breathe or see and the only solid 
things in the world were Ron��s arm and Hermione��s fingers, which were slowly slipping away. 

And then he saw the door to number twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent door knocker, 
but before he could draw breath, there was a scream and a flash of purple light, Hermione��s hand 
was suddenly vise-like upon his and everything went dark again.

Chapter Fourteen 

The Thief 

Harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by 


gold and 
green; he had no idea what had happened, he 

only knew 
that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves 

and twigs. 
Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt 

flattened, he 
blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was 

sunlight 
streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face. He 
pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small, fierce creature, but saw that 
the object was Ron��s foot. Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a 
forest floor, apparently alone. 

Harry��s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though he knew how 
foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at 
the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid��s hut. However, in the few moments it took for 
Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the 
Forbidden Forest; The trees looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer. 

He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron��s head. The moment his eyes fell upon 
Ron, all other concerns fled Harry��s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron��s left side and his 
face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off 
now, Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and 
redder as his face drained of the little color it had left.

 ��What��s happened to him?�� 

��Splinched,�� said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron��s sleeve, where the blood was 
wettest and darkest. 

Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron��s short. He had always thought of Splinching as 
something comical, but this ... His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron��s upper 
arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife. 

 ��Harry, quickly, in my bag, there��s a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany'�C��

 ��Bag �C right �C��

��194ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his 
hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his touch, He felt the leather 
spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes �C 

��Quickly!��

 He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag. 

��Accio Dittany!�� 

A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened back to Hermione and 
Ron, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white eyeball were all that were visible between 
his lids. 

��He��s fainted,�� said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda, 
though her hair was still gray in places. ��Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.�� 

Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle. Hermione took it and poured three drops of the 
potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry 
saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched 
over what had just been open flesh. 

 ��Wow,�� said Harry. 

��It��s all I feel safe doing,�� said Hermione shakily. ��There are spells that would put him 
completely right, but I daren��t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage... He��s lost so 
much blood already... �� 

��How did he get hurt? I mean�� �C Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make sense of 
whatever had just taken place �C ��why are we here? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld 
Place?��

 Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears.

 ��Harry, I don��t think we��re going to be able to go back there.��

 ��What d��you �C?�� 

��As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn��t get rid of him, he was too 
strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then �C well, I think 
he must have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so he slackened his grip and I 
managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead!�� 

��But then, where��s he? Hang on... You don��t mean he��s at Grimmauld Place? He can��t get in

��195ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

there?��

 Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded. 

��Harry, I think he can. I �C I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but I��d already taken 
him inside the Fidelius Charm��s protection. Since Dumbledore died, we��re Secret-Keepers, so I��ve 
given him the secret, haven��t I?�� 

There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could 
now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing 
other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had 
been their one safe refuge; even, now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of 
home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the house-elf 
busying himself over the steak-and-kidney pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat.

 ��Harry, I��m sorry, I��m so sorry!��

 ��Don��t be stupid, it wasn��t your fault! If anything, it was mine... �� 

Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye��s eye. Hermione recoiled, looking 
horrified. 

��Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn��t leave it there ... but 
that��s how they knew there were intruders.�� 

Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his eyes. He was still gray and his 
face glistened with sweat.

 ��How d��you feel?�� Hermione whispered. 

 ��Lousy,�� croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. ��Where are we?�� 

��In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,�� said Hermione. ��I wanted 
somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was �C�� 

���C the first place you thought of,�� Harry finished for her, glancing around at the apparently 
deserted glade�ּ�յ� grassy clearing in forest). He could not help remembering what had 
happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of �C how Death 
Eaters had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his henchmen 
know, even now, where Hermione had taken them? 

��D��you reckon we should move on?�� Ron asked Harry, and Harry could tell by the look on 
Ron��s face that he was thinking the same.

��196ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I dunno.�� 

Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he 
was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting. 

��Let��s stay here for now,�� Harry said. 

 Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet.

 ��Where are you going?�� asked Ron. 

��If we��re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,�� she replied, 
and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring 
incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air. It was as if Hermione 
had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. 

��Salvio Hexia ... Protego Totalum ... Repello Muggletum ... Muffliato ... You could get out the 

tent, Harry.��

 ��Tent?��

 ��In the bag!��

 ��In the ... of course,�� said Harry. 

He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. The tent 
emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, ropes, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the 
smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup. 

��I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?�� he asked, starting to disentangle 
the pent pegs. 

��Apparently he didn��t want it back, his lumbago's��ʹ so bad,�� said Hermione, now 
performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand. ��so Ron��s dad said I could 
borrow it. Erecto!�� she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one fluid 
motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before Harry, out of whose 
startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope (���� a cable, 
wire, or rope that is used to brace something (especially a tent). 

��Cave Inimicum,�� Hermione finished with a skyward flourish. ��That��s as much as I can do. At 

the very least, we should know they��re coming; I can��t guarantee it will keep out Vol �C��

 ��Don��t say the name!�� Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. 

 Harry and Hermione looked at each other.

��197ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I��m sorry,�� Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, ��but it feels like a �C 

a jinx or something. Can��t we call him You-Know-Who �C please?��

 ��Dumbledore said fear of a name �C�� began Harry. 

��In case you hadn��t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn��t do Dumbledore 
much good in the end,�� Ron snapped back. ��Just �C just show You-Know-Who some respect, will 
you?�� 

��Respect?�� Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he was not to 
argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition. 

Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent. The 
interior was exactly as Harry remembered it; a small flat, complete with bathroom and tiny 
kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a 
bunk��ʽ���� bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had 
settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while. 

��I��ll make some tea,�� said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of 
her bag and heading toward the kitchen. 

Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that Mad-Eye had 
died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. 

After a minute or two, Ron broke the silence. ��What d��you reckon happened to the 
Cattermoles?�� 

��With any luck, they��ll have got away,�� said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for comfort. ��As 
long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he��ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by SideAlong-
Apparition and they��ll be fleeing the country right now with their children. That��s what 
Harry told her to do.�� 

��Blimey, I hope they escaped,�� said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea seemed to be 
doing him good; a little of his color had returned. ��I didn��t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all 
that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they 
made it... If they both end up in Azkaban because of us ...�� 

Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask �C about whether Mrs. 
Cattermole��s lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband �C died in his 
throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such

��198ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing 

him.

 ��So, have you got it?�� Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there.

 ��Got �C got what?�� she said with a little start.

 ��What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where��s the locket?�� 

��You got it?�� shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows. ��No one tells me 
anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!�� 

��Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren��t we?�� said Hermione. 
��Here.��

 And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron. 

It was as large as a chicken��s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green stones, 
glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent��s canvas roof. 

��There isn��t any chance someone��s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?�� asked Ron hopefully. ��I 
mean, are we sure it��s still a Horcrux?��

 ��I think so,�� said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. ��There��d be some 
sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.�� 

She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked perfect, pristine. He 
remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the Horcrux ring had been 
cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it. 

��I reckon Kreacher��s right,�� said Harry. ��We��re going to have to work out how to open this 
thing before we can destroy it.�� 

Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit 
Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket 
from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with his fingers, then 
attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus��s bedroom door. Neither worked. He 
handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were no more 
successful at opening it than he had been. 

��Can you feel it, though?�� Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his clenched fist. 

��What d��you mean?�� 

Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry.

��199ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing 
through his veins that he could feel, or was it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal 
heart?

 ��What are we going to do with it?�� Hermione asked. 

��Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it.�� Harry replied, and, little though he wanted to, 
he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it 
rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him. 

��I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,�� he added to Hermione, 
standing up and stretching. ��And we��ll need to think about some food as well. You stay there,�� he 
added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green.

 With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in 
the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However, the 
Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective 
enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people 
rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and 
squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at 
ten o��clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across 
the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing. 

He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had not packed any food in her magical 
bag, as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had 
had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the 
nearest trees and stewed in a Billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion 
away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as to not hurt Hermione��s feelings. 

The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs, 
Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, yet he kept his wand held tight 
at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery 
mushrooms, tingled with unease. 

He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but 
somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a 
tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he had been hurtling toward

��200ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt halt, run out of 
road. 

There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest idea where 
they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. Meanwhile he was at a loss to know 
how to destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that currently lay against the bare 
flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it 
might just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, 
that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own. Nameless forebodings 
crept upon him as he sat there in the dark. He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came 
at him relentlessly. Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking 
softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to. He could not. And it seemed to 
Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his 
chest was ticking away the time he had left... Stupid idea, he told himself, don��t think that... 

His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was making it happen by having 
these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another channel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who 
had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would the elf keep silent or would he 
tell the Death Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed 
towards him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? 
What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry��s head and he tried to 
push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher. He and Hermione had 
already decided against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They 
could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to 
Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione��s sleeve. 

Harry��s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they did not know, Lupin 
had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. Why hadn��t Dumbledore 
explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he would live for years, for 
centuries perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong. Snape had seen to 
that... Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower ... 

 And Dumbledore had fallen ... fallen ...

��Give it to me, Gregorovitch.�� 

Harry��s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by a long-fingered white 
hand. The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were 
no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his limbs wrapped about him, 
his terrified face, on a level with Harry��s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head. He 
had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard, a trussed��, ��-up Father Christmas.

 ��I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen from me!��

 ��Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows... He always knows.�� 

The hanging man��s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and 
bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole �C 

And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch��s wake as he 
held a lantern aloft, Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern 
illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of 
light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair. 
In the split second that the lantern��s light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his 
handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward 
out of the window with a crow of laughter. 

And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils and Gregorovitch��s face was 

stricken with terror.

 ��Who was the thief, Gregorovitch?�� said the high cold voice.

 ��I do not know, I never knew, a young man �C no �C please �C PLEASE!��

 A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light - 

��Harry!�� 

He opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had passed out against the side of the 
tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. He looked up at 
Hermione, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high 
above them. 

��Dream,�� he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet Hermione��s glower with a look of 
innocence. ��Must��ve dozed off, sorry.��

 ��I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were looking into Vol �C��

��Don��t say his name!�� came Ron��s angry voice from the depths of the tent.

 ��Fine,�� retorted Hermione, ��You-Know-Who��s mind, then!�� 

��I didn��t mean it to happen!�� Harry said. ��It was a dream! Can you control what you dream 
about, Hermione?��

 ��If you just learned to apply Occlumency �C��

 But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to discuss what he had just seen. 

��He��s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he��s killed him, but before he killed him he 
read Gregorovitch��s mind and I saw �C�� 

��I think I��d better take over the watch if you��re so tired you��re falling sleep,�� said Hermione 
coldly.

 ��I can finish the watch!��

 ��No, you��re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.�� 

She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing to avoid a 

row, Harry ducked back inside. 

Ron��s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the one above 
him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After several moments, Ron spoke in a 
voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the entrance.

 ��What��s You-Know-Who doing?�� 

Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered into the 
darkness. 

 ��He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.�� 

��How��s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he��s tied up?��

 ��I dunno... It��s weird, isn��t it?�� 

Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all that he had seen and heard. The more he recalled, the less 
sense it made... Voldemort had said nothing about Harry��s wand, nothing about the twin cores, 
nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat Harry��s.

 ��He wanted something from Gregorovitch,�� Harry said, eyes still closed tight. ��He asked him to 
hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him ... and then ... then ...�� 

He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle through Gregorovitch��s eyes, into 
his memories.

��203ҳ��

��He read Gregorovitch��s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill, and he 
fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he stole whatever You-KnowWho��s 
after. And I ... I think I��ve seen him somewhere... ��

 Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy��s face. The theft had happened 
many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look familiar? 

The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all Harry could hear was 
Ron��s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, ��Couldn��t you see what the thief was holding?��

 ��No ... it must��ve been something small.��

 ��Harry?��

 The wooden slats of Ron��s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed. 

 ��Harry, you don��t reckon You-Know-Who��s after something else to turn into a Horcrux?�� 

��I don��t know,�� said Harry slowly. ��Maybe. But wouldn��t it be dangerous for him to make 

another one? Didn��t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?��

 ��Yeah, but maybe he doesn��t know that.��

 ��Yeah ... maybe,�� said Harry. 

He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin 
cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker ... and yet he had killed him, 
apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore. 

What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the Wizarding world 
at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object that Gregorovitch had once owned, 
and which had been stolen by the unknown thief? 

Harry could still see the blond-haired youth��s face; it was merry, wild; there was a Fred and 
George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him. He had soared from the windowsill like a bird, 
and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. 

With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and it was on 
him that Harry��s thoughts dwelled, as Ron��s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he 
himself drifted slowly into sleep once more.

Chapter Fifteen 
The Goblin��s Revenge 


Early next morning, before the other two were 
left the tent to search the woods around them for 
gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. 
shadows he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and 
by gouging a small cross in the bark with his 
not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would

awake, Harry 
the oldest, most 
There in its 
marked the spot 
wand. It was 
have much 
Umbridge's 

door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going 
to do next. 

Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with 
the sole provison that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione 
therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron 
obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. 
Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town. 

Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copseС��ľ�� of trees and surrounded 
it with freshly cast defensive enchantments. Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find 
sustenance (food). This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an 
unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he 
stood. 

"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent 
empty handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors. 

 "I couldn't ... make one." he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. "Wouldn't ... come." 

Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a 
nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, 
as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he was not 
going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry's willpower to uproot himself from the 
spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able

��205ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went. 

 "So we still haven't got any food." 

"Shut up, Ron," snapped Hermione. "Harry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn't 

make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!"

 "I don't know." 

He sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was 
afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago. Today he 
might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express. 

Ron kicked a chair leg. "What?" he snarled at Hermione. "I'm starving! All I've had since I bled 
half to death is a couple of toadstools!"

 "You go and fight your way through the dementors, then," said Harry, stung. 

 "I would, but my arm's in a sling, in case you hadn't noticed!"

 "That's convenient."

 "And what's that supposed to -?" 

"Of course!" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into 
silence. "Harry, give me the locket! Come on," she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him 
when he did not react, "the Horcrux, Harry, you're still wearing it!" 

She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The moment it parted 
contact with Harry's skin he felt free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy 
or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted.

 "Better?" asked Hermione.

 "Yeah, loads better!" 

"Harry," she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated 
with visiting the very sick, "you don't think you've been possessed, do you?" 

"What? No!" he said defensively, "I remember everything we've done while I've bee wearing it. 
I wouldn't know what I'd done if I'd been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times 
when she couldn't remember anything." 

"Hmm," said Hermione, looking down at the heavy locket. "Well, maybe we ought not to wear 
it. We can just keep it in the tent." 

"We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around," Harry stated firmly. "If we lose it, if it gets

��206ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

stolen -" 

 "Oh, all right, all right," said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out 
of sight down the front of her shirt. "But we'll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too 
long."

 "Great," said Ron irritably, "and now we've sorted that out, can we please get some food?" 

"Fine, but we'll go somewhere else to find it," said Hermione with half a glance at Harry. 
"There's no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around." 

In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung�㲼�� (spread over a large area) field 
belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread. 

"It's not stealing, is it?" asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs 
on toast. "Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?"

 Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, "Er-my-nee, 'oo worry 'oo much. 'Elax!" 

And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed. The argument 
about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as 
he took the first of the three night watches. 

This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits, an empty one, 
bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near 
starvation at the Dursleys��. Hermione bore up���� 
reasonably well on those nights when they 
managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than 
usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a 
day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both 
unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron's turn to wear the Horcrux, 
he became downright unpleasant. 

"So where next?" was his constant refrain��ͷ�� 
. He did not seem to have any ideas himself, 
but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded (sulk) over the 
low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where 
they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they already got, their 
conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they got no new information. 

As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places 
important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that

��207ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised; Hogwarts, 
where he had been educated; Borgin and Burks, where he had worked after completing school; 
then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile. These formed the basis of their speculations. 

"Yeah, let's go to Albania. Shouldn't take more than an afternoon to search an entire country," 
said Ron sarcastically. 

"There can't be anything there. He'd already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into 
exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth," said Hermione. "We know the snake's 
not in Albania, it's usually with Vol��"

 "Didn't I ask you to stop say that?"

 "Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who, happy?"

 "Not particularly." 

"I can't see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes." said Harry, who had made this point 
many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. "Borgin and Burke were 
experts at Dark objects, they would've recognized a Horcrux straightaway." 

Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Harry plowed on, 
"I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts." 

 Hermione sighed. "But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!"

 Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory. 

"Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwart's secrets. I'm 

telling you, if there was one place Vol��" 

 "Oi!" 

"YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!" Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. "If there was one place 

that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!" 

 "Oh, come on," scoffed Ron. "His school?" 

"Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special, it meant 
everything to him, and even after he left -" 

 "This is You-Know-Who we're talking about, right? Not you?" inquired Ron. He was tugging at 
the chain of the Horcrux around his neck; Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him. 

"You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left," said 
Hermione.

��208ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"That's right," said Harry. 

"And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably 
another founder's object, to make into another Horcrux?" 

 ��Yeah,�� said Harry. 

��But he didn��t get the job, did he?�� said Hermione. ��So he never got the chance to find a 

founder��s object there and hide it in the school!��

 ��Okay, then,�� said Harry, defeated. ��Forget Hogwarts.�� 

Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, 
search for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and 
discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before. They visited 
its site and found a tower block of offices. 

 ��We could try digging in to foundations?�� Hermione suggested halfheartedly. 

��He wouldn��t have hidden a Horcrux here,�� Harry said. He had known it all along. The 
orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have 
hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or 
mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could 
imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding banks, with its 
gilded doors and marble floors. 

Even without any new idea, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent 
in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed 
all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by 
Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered 
mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly coveС���� 
. Every twelve hours or so they passed 
the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of passthe-
parcel, where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of 
increased fear and anxiety. 

Harry��s scare kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was wearing the 

Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain. 

 ��What? What did you see?�� demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince. 

 ��A face,�� muttered Harry, every time. ��The same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.��

��209ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron 
was hoping to hear news of his family or the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, 
Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not 
tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown 
youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no 
better than he did. As Harry��s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam 
tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other 
two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, 
when they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes. 

As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having 
conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry 
entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads 
together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them 
and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water. 

Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a 
pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn 
in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that 
Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further 
Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of 
the others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it. 

Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it. They were now pitching the tent 
on mulches (spread leaves or straw around plants) of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast 
by the dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better 
at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack 
of other people��s company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against 
Voldemort. 

��My mother,�� said Ron on night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, ��can make 
good food appear out of thin air.��

��210ҳ��

He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. Harry glanced automatically 
at Ron��s neck and saw, as he has expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He 
managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve 
slightly when the time came to take off the locket. 

��Your mother can��t produce food out of thin air,�� said Hermione. ��No one can. Food is the first 

of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp��s Law of Elemental Transfigura -��

 ��Oh, speak English, can��t you?�� Ron said, prising a fish out from between his teeth. 

��It��s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, 

you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you��ve already got some -��

 ��Well, don��t bother increasing this, it��s disgusting,�� said Ron. 

��Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I��m always the one who ends up 

sorting out the food, because I��m a girl, I suppose!��

 ��No, it��s because you��re supposed to be the best at magic!�� shot back Ron. 

 Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike���ƹ������ 
slid off her tin plate onto the floor. 

��You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them 

into something worth eating, and I��ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see you -��

 ��Shut up!�� said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. ��Shut up now!��

 Hermione looked outraged. ��How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook -��

 ��Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!�� 

He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and 

gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It 

was not moving.

 ��You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?�� he whispered to Hermione. 

��I did everything,�� she whispered back, ��Muffliato, Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment 

Charms, all of it. They shouldn��t be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.�� 

Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, told them 
that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow 
bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had 
cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the 
notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their

��211ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time. 

The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Harry 
estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it 
impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a 
moment she drew out three Extendible Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily 
inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent 
entrance.

 Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice. 

��There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d��you reckon it��s too early in the season? Accio 
Salmon!�� 

There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. 
Somebody grunted appreciatively. 

Harry pressed the Extendable ear deeper into his own. Over the murmur of the river he could 
make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever 
heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there 
seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other. 

A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas, large shadows passed between tent and 
flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the 
clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.

 ��Here, Griphook, Gornuk.��

 Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. 

 ��Thank you,�� said the goblins together in English. 

��So, you three have been on the run how long?�� asked a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it 
was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man. 

��Six weeks ... Seven ... I forget,�� said the tired man. ��Met up with Griphook in the first couple 
of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.�� There was a 
pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. 
��What made you leave, Ted?�� continued the man. 

��Knew they were coming for me,�� replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who 
he was, Tonks��s father. ��Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I��d better run

��212ҳ��

for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, 
knew I��d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she��s pure-blood. And then I met Dean 
here, what, a few days ago, son?�� 

��Yeah,�� said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but 
besides themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow 
Gryffindor.

 ��Muggle-born, eh?�� asked the first man. 

��Not sure,�� said Dean. ��My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I��ve got no proof he was a 
wizard, though.��

 There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching, then Ted spoke again. 

��I��ve got to say, Dirk, I��m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was that 

you��d been caught.�� 

��I was,�� said Dirk. ��I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it. Stunned Dawlish, 
and nicked his broom. It was easier than you��d think; I don��t reckon he��s quite right at the moment. 
Might be Confunded. If so, I��d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably 
saved my life.�� 

There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on. The Ted said, ��And 
where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the 
whole.�� 

��You had a false impression,�� said the higher-voiced of the goblins. ��We take no sides. This is 

a wizards�� war.��

 ��How come you��re in hiding, then?�� 

��I deemed it prudent,�� said the deeper-voiced goblin. ��Having refused what I considered an 

impertinent request, I could see that my personal safety was in jeopardy.��

 ��What did they ask you to do?�� asked Ted. 

��Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,�� replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less 

human as he said it. ��I am not a house-elf.��

 ��What about you, Griphook?�� 

��Similar reasons,�� said the higher voiced goblin. ��Gringotts is no longer under the sole control 

of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master.��

��213ҳ��

He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk laughed.

 ��What��s the joke?�� asked Dean. 

 ��He said,�� replied Dirk, ��that there are things wizards don��t recognize, either.��

 There was a short pause. 

 ��I don��t get it,�� said Dean.

 ��I had my small revenge before I left,�� said Griphook in English. 

��Good man -goblin, I should say,�� amended Ted hastily. ��Didn��t manage to lock a Death Eater 
up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?�� 

��If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,�� replied Griphook. Gornuk laughed 

again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle.

 ��Dean and I are still missing something here,�� said Ted. 

��So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,�� said Griphook, and the two goblins roared 
with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry��s breathing was shallow with excitement, He and 
Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could. 

��Didn��t you hear about that, Ted?�� asked Dirk. ��About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor��s 
sword out of Snape��s office at Hogwarts?�� 

An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted 
to the spot. 

 ��Never heard a word,�� said Ted, ��Not in the Prophet, was it?�� 

��Hardly,�� chortled Dirk. ��Griphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill Weasley who 
works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill��s younger sister.�� 

Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as 
tightly as lifelines. 

��She and a couple of friends got into Snape��s office and smashed open the glass case where he 
was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the 
staircase.�� 

��Ah, God bless 'em,�� said Ted. ��What did they think, that they��d be able to use the sword on 
You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself? 

��Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn��t 
safe where it was,�� said Dirk. ��Couple of days later, once he��d got the say-so (approval) from You


��214ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.��

 The goblins started to laugh again.

 ��I��m still not seeing the joke,�� said Ted.

 ��It��s a fake,�� rasped Griphook.

 ��The sword of Gryffindor!�� 

��Oh yes. It is a copy -an excellent copy, it is true -but it was Wizard-made. The original was 

forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. 

Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank.��

 ��I see,�� said Ted. ��And I take it you didn��t bother telling the Death Eaters this?�� 

��I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,�� said Griphook smugly, and now Ted 

and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk��s laughter. 

Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question he needed answered, 
and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged, he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-
boyfriend of Ginny��s too.

 ��What happened to Ginny and all the others? The ones who tried to steal it?��

 ��Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,�� said Griphook indifferently. 

��They��re okay, though?�� asked Ted quickly, ��I mean, the Weasleys don��t need any more of 
their kids injured, do they?��

 ��They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,�� said Griphook. 

��Lucky for them,�� said Ted. ��With Snape��s track record I suppose we should just be glad 
they��re still alive.�� 

��You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?�� asked Dirk.�� You believe Snape killed 
Dumbledore? 

��'Course I do,�� said Ted. ��You��re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had 
anything to do with it?��

 ��Hard to know what to believe these days,�� muttered Dirk. 

��I know Harry Potter,�� said Dean. ��And I reckon he��s the real thing -the Chosen One, or 
whatever you want to call it.�� 

��Yeah, there��s a lot would like to believe he��s that, son,�� said Dirk, ��me included. But where is 
he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You��d think if he knew anything we don��t, or had anything

special going for him, he��d be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And 
you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against him -�� 

��The Prophet?�� scoffed Ted. ��You deserve to be lied to if you��re still reading that much, Dirk. 
You want the facts, try the Quibbler.�� 

There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal of thumping, by the 
sound of it. Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he sputtered, ��The Quibbler? That lunatic rag 
of Xeno Lovegood��s?�� 

��It��s not so lunatic these days,�� said Ted. ��You want to give it a look, Xeno is printing all the 
stuff the Prophet��s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. 
How long they��ll let him get with it, mind, I don��t know. But Xeno says, front page of every issue, 
that any wizard who��s against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-
one priority.��

 ��Hard to help a boy who��s vanished off the face of the earth,�� said Dirk. 

��Listen, the fact that they haven��t caught him yet��s one hell of an achievement,�� said Ted. ��I��d 
take tips from him gladly; it��s what we��re trying to do, stay free, isn��t it?�� 

��Yeah, well, you��ve got a point there,�� said Dirk heavily. ��With the whole of the Ministry and 
all their informers looking for him, I��d have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who��s to say 
they haven��t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?��

 ��Ah, don��t say that, Dirk,�� murmured Ted. 

There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they spoke again 
it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. 
Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up 
the incline, their voices fading away. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found the need to 
remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say 
more then, ��Ginny - the sword -��

 ��I know!�� said Hermione.

 She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit. 

��Here ... we ... are ...�� she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was 
evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight.

Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of Hermione��s 
bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment. 

��If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledore��s office,�� she 
panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, ��Phineas Nigellus would have 
seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!�� 

��Unless he was asleep,�� said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front 

of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said, 

 ��Er��Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?��

 Nothing happened. 

��Phineas Nigellus?�� said Hermione again. ��Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? 

Please?��

 ��'Please' always helps,�� said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. 

At once, Hermione cried, ��Obscura!�� 

A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus��s clever, dark eyes, causing him to bump into 

the frame and shriek with pain. 

 ��What - how dare - what are you -?��

 ��I��m very sorry, Professor Black,�� said Hermione, ��but it��s a necessary precaution!�� 

��Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! 
Where am I? What is going on?�� 

��Never mind where we are,�� said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, abandoning his attempts to 
peel off the painted blindfold.

 ��Can that possible be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?�� 

��Maybe,�� said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus��s interest. ��We��ve got a 
couple of questions to ask you - about the sword of Gryffindor.�� 

��Ah,�� said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight 
of Harry, ��yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there -��

 ��Shut up about my sister,�� said Ron roughly, Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows.

 ��Who else is here?�� he asked, turning his head from side to side. ��Your tone displeases me! The 
girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster.��

 ��They weren��t thieving,�� said Harry. ��That sword isn��t Snape��s.��

��217ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It belongs to Professor Snape��s school,�� said Phineas Nigellus. ��Exactly what claim did the 
Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the 
Lovegood oddity!��

 ��Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!�� said Hermione. 

��Where am I?�� repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. ��Where 
have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?��

 ��Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?�� asked Harry urgently.

 ��Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.��

 ��Hagrid��s not an oaf!�� said Hermione shrilly. 

��And Snape might��ve though that was a punishment,�� said Harry, ��buy Ginny, Neville, and 

Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest ... they��ve faced plenty worse 

than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!��

 He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at the very least. 

��What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, taken out 

the sword at all? Maybe it��s been taken away for cleaning... or something!��

 Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered. 

��Muggle-born,�� he said, ��Goblin-made armor does not require cleaning, simple girl. Goblin��s 

silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.��

 ��Don��t call Hermione simple,�� said Harry. 

��I grow weary of contradiction,�� said Phineas Nigellus. ��Perhaps it is time for me to return to 
the headmaster��s office.��

 Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out of his picture 
and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration.

 ��Dumbledore! Can��t you bring us Dumbledore?��

 ��I beg your pardon?�� asked Phineas Nigellus. 

 ��Professor Dumbledore��s portrait��couldn��t you bring him along, here, into yours?��

 Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry��s voice. 

��Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The portraits of Hogwarts may 
commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside of the castle except to visit a painting of 
themselves elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me, and after the treatment I have

��218ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

received at your hands, I can assure you that I will not be making a return visit!��

 Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame. 

��Professor Black,�� said Hermione, ��couldn��t you just tell us, please, when was the last time the 

sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean?��

 Phineas snorted impatiently. 

��I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor 
Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.�� 

Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in front of Phineas 
Nigellus, who had at last managed to locate the exit. 

��Well, good night to you,�� he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again. 
Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout. 

 ��Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?��

 Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture. 

��Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many eccentricities of Albus 

Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!��

 And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop. 

 ��Harry!�� Hermione cried. 

��I know!�� Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he 
had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did 
not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing��ѹ 
Phineas Nigellus��s back into the 
beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to 
Harry. 

��The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthens 
them - Harry, that sword��s impregnated (saturate, imbue) with basilisk venom!�� 

��And Dumbledore didn��t give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the 
locket -��

 ��- and he must have realized they wouldn��t let you have it if he put it in his will -��

 ��- so he made a copy -��

 ��- and put a fake in the glass case -��

 ��- and he left the real one - where?��

��219ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

They gazed at east other. Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above 
them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn��t Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but 
Harry had not realized it at the time?

 ��Think!�� whispered Hermione. ��Think! Where would he have left it?��

 ��Not at Hogwarts,�� said Harry, resuming his pacing.

 ��Somewhere in Hogsmeade?�� suggested Hermione.

 ��The Shrieking Shack?�� said Harry. ��Nobody ever goes in there.��

 ��But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn��t that be a bit risky?��

 ��Dumbledore trusted Snape,�� Harry reminded her. 

 ��Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,�� said Hermione. 

��Yeah, you��re right!�� said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the thought that Dumbledore 
had had some reservations, however faint, about Snape��s trustworthiness. ��So, would he have 
hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d��you reckon, Ron? Ron?�� 

Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left the tent, then 
realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a bunk, looking stony.

 ��Oh, remembered me, have you?�� he said. 

 ��What?��

 Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk. 

 ��You two carry on. Don��t let me spoil your fun.�� 

Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, apparently as 

nonplussed as he was. 

 ��What��s the problem?�� asked Harry. 

��Problem? There��s no problem,�� said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. ��Not according to 

you, anyways.��

 There were several plunks�������� 
on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain. 

 ��Well, you��ve obviously got a problem,�� said Harry. ��Spit it out, will you?��

 Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike himself. 

��All right, I��ll spit it out. Don��t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there��s some 
other damn thing we��ve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you don��t know.��

 ��I don��t know?�� repeated Harry. ��I don��t know?��

��220ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank 
all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry��s jubilation; 
Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking. 

��It��s not like I��m not having the time of my life here,�� said Ron, ��you know, with my arm 
mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after 
we��d been running round a few weeks, we��d have achieved something.�� 

��Ron,�� Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it 

over the loud tattoo�����н�����û��� the rain was beating on the tent.

 ��I thought you knew what you��d signed up for,�� said Harry.

 ��Yeah, I thought I did too.�� 

��So what part of it isn��t living up to your expectations?�� asked Harry. Anger was coming to his 
defense now. ��Did you think we��d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other 
day? Did you think you��d be back to Mummy by Christmas?�� 

��We thought you knew what you were doing!�� shouted Ron, standing up, and his words pierced 
Harry like scalding knives. ��We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had 
a real plan!�� 

��Ron!�� said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but 
again, he ignored her. 

��Well, sorry to let you down,�� said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, 
inadequate. ��I��ve been straight with you from the start. I told you everything Dumbledore told me. 
And in the case you haven��t noticed, we��ve found one Horcrux -�� 

��Yeah, and we��re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them -nowhere 
effing near in other words.�� 

��Take off the locket, Ron,�� Hermione said, her voice unusually high. ��Please take it off. You 
wouldn��t be talking like this if you hadn��t been wearing it all day.�� 

��Yeah, he would,�� said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. ��D��you think I haven��t 
noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D��you think I didn��t guess you were thinking 
this stuff?

 ��Harry, we weren��t -�� 

��Don��t lie!�� Ron hurled at her. ��You said it too, you said you were disappointed, you said

you��d thought he had a bit more to go on than -��

 ��I didn��t say it like that - Harry, I didn��t!�� she cried. 

The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione��s face, and the excitement 
of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared 
and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they knew 
not where, and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be 
dead.

 ��So why are you still here?�� Harry asked Ron. 

��Search me,�� said Ron. 

 ��Go home then,�� said Harry. 

��Yeah, maybe I will!�� shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back 
away. ��Didn��t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don��t give a rat��s fart, do you, it��s 
only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I��ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn��t care what happened to her in 
there - well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff -��

 ��I was only saying - she was with the others, they were with Hagrid -�� 

��Yeah, I get it, you don��t care! And what about the rest of my family, 'the Weasleys don��t need 
another kid injured,' did you hear that?�� 

��Yeah, I -��

 ��Not bothered what it meant, though?��

 ��Ron!�� said Hermione, forcing her way between them. ��I don��t think it means anything new has 
happened, anything we don��t know about; think, Ron, Bill��s already scarred, plenty of people must 
have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you��re supposed to be on your deathbed with 
spattergroit, I��m sure that��s all he meant -�� 

��Oh, you��re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won��t bother myself about them. It��s all right for 

you, isn��t it, with your parents safely out of the way -��

 ��My parents are dead!�� Harry bellowed.

 ��And mine could be going the same way!�� yelled Ron. 

��Then GO!�� roared Harry. ��Go back to them, pretend you��ve got over your spattergroit and 
Mummy��ll be able to feed you up and -�� 

Ron made a sudden movement, Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner��s

pocket, Hermione had raised her own. 

��Prestego!�� she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side 
and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, 
and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing 
each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron, Something had 
broken between them.

 ��Leave the Horcrux,�� Harry said. 

Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to 
Hermione.

 ��What are you doing?��

 ��What do you mean?��

 ��Are you staying, or what?�� 

��I ...�� She looked anguished. ��Yes -yes, I��m staying. Ron, we said we��d go with Harry, we said 

we��d help -��

 ��I get it. You choose him.��

 ��Ron, no �C please - come back, come back!�� 

She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed it he had already 

stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron��s 

name amongst the trees.

 After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face.

 ��He��s g-g-gone! Disapparated!��

 She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry. 

Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his own neck. He 
dragged blankets off Ron��s bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own 
bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.

turning his 
bunk. It was 
eyes. Harry 
eyes averted 

from Ron's. Hermione, who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but 
turned her face away quickly as he went by. 

He's gone, Harry told himself. He's gone. He had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed as 
though repetition would dull the shock of it. He's gone and he's not coming back. And that was the 
simple truth of it, Harry knew, because their protective enchantments meant that it would be 
impossible, once they vacated this spot, for Ron to find them again. 

He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione's eyes were puffy and red�ֺ����� 
; she 
looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why 
she wanted to spin out���ӳ� 
their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, 
and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy 
rain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked 
around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, 
another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, "We thought you knew 
what you were doing!", and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach. 

The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank. They 
had lingered a good���� hour after they would usually have departed their campsite. Finally 
having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable to find any more 
reasons to delay. She and Harry gasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept 
heatherʯ�ϻ�-covered hillside. 

The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry's hand and walked away from him, finally

��224ҳ��

sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He 
watched her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the 
spot. Everything inside him felt cold and tight. Again he saw the contemptuous expression on 
Ron's face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught 
Hermione at its center, casting the spell she usually performed to ensure their protection. 

They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to mention 
his name again and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although 
sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry 
had started bringing out the Marauder's map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for 
the moment when Ron's labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he 
had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not 
appear on the map and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny's 
name in the girl's dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might 
break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was 
all right. 

By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of Gryffindor's 
sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the 
more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry 
could not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something. 
There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. 
We thought you knew what you were doing ... We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do ... 
We thought you had a real plan! 

He could not hide it from himself, Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him with virtually 
nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it. The others 
were as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to engulf him. He was 
staggered (shocked) now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends' offers to 
accompany him on this meandering���� 
, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and 
he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indications that Hermione too was about to tell 
him that she had had enough, that she was leaving.

��225ҳ��

They were spending many evenings in near silence and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas 
Nigellus's portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left 
by Ron's departure. Despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas 
Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to and 
consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was even glad to see him, because 
he was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind. They relished any news about what was 
happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, 
the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful 
not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave 
his painting. 

However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, low level of 
mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape 
had reinstated Umbridge's old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any 
unofficial student societies. From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably 
Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumbledore's Army. This 
scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him 
think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as 
his ex-girlfriend. Indeed, as Phineas Niggellus talked about Snape's crackdown��ѹ 
, Harry 
experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the 
destabilization of Snape��s regime. Being fed and having a soft bed and other people being in 
charge seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at this moment. But then he remembered 
that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand Galleon price on his head, and 
that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. 
Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about 
Harry and Hermione��s whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time 
he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these 
unceremonious good-byes. 

The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any area too long, so rather 
than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they

��226ҳ��

continued to meander up and down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet pounded the 
tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle 
of a Scottish loch (Scottish) lake, where snow half buried the tent in the night. 

They had already spotted Christmas Trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before 
there came an evening when Harry resolved to suggest again, what seemed to him the only 
unexplored avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal, Hermione had been 
to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as 
she left), and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of 
spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. 

He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours�� break from wearing the 

Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him.

 ��Hermione?�� 

��Hmm?�� She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The Tales of Beedle the Bard. 
He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, which was not, after all, very 
long, but evidently she was still deciphering something in it, because Spellman��s Syllabary lay 
open on the arm of the chair. 

Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several years 
previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, 
despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip. 

 ��Hermione, I��ve been thinking, and �C��

 ��Harry, could you help me with something?�� 

Apparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and held out The Tales of 
Beedle the Bard. 

��Look at that symbol,�� she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry assumed was 
the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what 
looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.

 ��I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.�� 

��I know that; but it isn��t a rune and it��s not in the syllabary, either. All along I thought it was a 
picture of an eye, but I don��t think it is! It��s been inked in, look, somebody��s drawn it there, it isn��t 
really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?��

��227ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No ... No, wait a moment.�� Harry looked closer. ��Isn��t it the same symbol Luna��s dad was 
wearing round his neck?�� 
��Well, that��s what I thought too!�� 
��Then it��s Grindelwald��s mark.��

 She stared at him, openmouthed. ��What?�� 

��Krum told me ...�� 

He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding. 

Hermione looked astonished. ��Grindelwald��s mark?�� 

She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. ��I��ve never heard that Grindelwald 
had a mark. There��s no mention of it in anything I��ve ever read about him.�� 
��Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durmstrang, and 
Grindelwald put it there.�� 
She fell back into the old armchair, frowning. 
��That��s very odd. If it��s a symbol of Dark Magic, what��s it doing in a book of children��s 
stories?�� 
��Yeah, it is weird,�� said Harry. ��And you��d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was 
Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.�� 
��I know. Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories have little pictures 
over the titles.�� She did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. 

Harry tried again. ��Hermione?��

 ��Hmm?��

 ��I��ve been thinking. I �C I want to go to Godric��s Hollow.��

 She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was sure she was still thinking about 
the mysterious mark on the book. 

 ��Yes,�� she said. ��Yes, I��ve been wondering that too. I really think we��ll have to.��

 ��Did you hear me right?�� he asked. 

��Of course I did. You want to go to Godric��s Hollow. I agree. I think we should. I mean, I can��t 
think of anywhere else it could be either. It��ll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more 
likely it seems it��s there.�� 

��Er �C what��s there?�� asked Harry.

��228ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt. 
��Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you��d want to go back there, and I 
mean, Godric��s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor��s birthplace �C�� 
��Really? Gryffindor came from Godric��s Hollow?�� 
��Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?�� 
��Erm,�� he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months. The muscles in his face felt 
oddly stiff. ��I might��ve opened it, you know, when I bought it ... just the once... �� 
��Well, as the village is named after him, I��d have thought you might have made the 
connection,�� said Hermione. 

She sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late; Harry half expected her to 
announce that she was off to the library. ��There��s a bit about the village in A History of Magic, 
wait ...�� 

She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally extracting her copy of their old 
school textbook A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through (go through 
something quickly) until finding the page she wanted. 

����Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding 
for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small communities within a 
community. Many small villages and hamlets��small village��attracted several magical families, 
who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworsh in Cornwall, 
Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable 
homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded 
Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric��s Hollow, the 
West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman 
Wright, Wizarding smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of 
ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have 
dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.�� 

��You and your parents aren��t mentioned.�� Hermione said, closing the book, ��because Professor 
Bagshot doesn��t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric��s 
Hollow, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor��s sword; don��t you think Dumbledore would have expected 
you to make the connection?��

��229ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Oh yeah ...�� 

Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he 
suggested they go to Godric��s Hollow. For him, the lure of the village lay in his parents�� graves, 
the house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot. 

 ��Remember what Muriel said?�� he asked eventually.

 ��Who?�� 

��You know,�� he hesitated. He did not want to say Ron��s name. ��Ginny��s great-aunt. At the 
wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.�� 

��Oh,�� said Hermione. It was a sticky moment, Harry knew that she had sensed Ron��s name in 

the offing (�ڸ����������Ҫ���Ƶ�). He rushed on:

 ��She said Bathilda Bagshot still lived in Godric��s Hollow.�� 

��Bathilda Bagshot,�� murmured Hermione, running her index finger over Bathilda��s embossed

ʹ������� name on the front cover of A History of Magic. ��Well, I suppose �C�� 

She gasped so dramatically that Harry��s insides turned over; he drew his wand, looking around 
at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there 
was nothing there. 

��What?�� he said, half angry, half relieved. ��What did you do that for? I thought you��d seen a 

Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least �C��

 ��Harry, what if Bathilda��s got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her?�� 

Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now, and 
according to Muriel, she was ��gaga.�� Was it likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword 
of Gryffindor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance, 
Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much as 
mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt on 
Hermione��s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with (agree with) Harry��s 
dearest wish. 

 ��Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric��s Hollow?�� 

��Yes, but we��ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.�� She was sitting up now, and Harry 
could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. ��We��ll need 
to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a start, and perhaps

��230ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think we should go the whole hog����
�ɣ��ɵ��� 
and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we��ll need to collect hair from somebody. I 
actually think we��d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the better.�� 

Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause, but his mind had left the 
conversation. For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he 
felt excited. 

He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family. It was in 
Godric��s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday. 
He could have invited friends to his house... He might even have had brothers and sisters... It 
would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had 
hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place 
where it had been taken from him. 

After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from 
Hermione��s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long 
ago. For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up 
at him from the images, which were all he had left of them now. 

Harry would gladly have set out for Godric��s Hollow the following day, but Hermione had 
other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his 
parents�� deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they 
had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later �C once they had surreptitiously 
obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had practiced 
Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together �C that Hermione 
agreed to make the journey. 

They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when 
they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle 
man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag containing all of their 
possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into 
an inside pocket of Hermione��s buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, 
then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again.

��231ҳ��

Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing hand in hand in a snowy 
lane under a dark blue sky, in which the night��s first stars were already glimmering feebly. 
Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their 
windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the 
village. 

��All this snow!�� Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. ��Why didn��t we think of snow? After 
all our precautions, we��ll leave prints! We��ll just have to get rid of them �C you go in front, I��ll do it 
�C�� 

Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves 
concealed while magically covering their traces.

 ��Let��s take off the Cloak,�� said Harry, and when she looked frightened, ��Oh, come on, we don��t 
look like us and there��s no one around.�� 

He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered, the icy air 
stinging their faces as they passed more cottages. Any one of them might have been the one in 
which James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, 
their snow-burdened roofs, and their front porches, wondering whether he remembered any of 
them, knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little more than a year old when 
he had left this place forever. He was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at 
all; he did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little 
lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, 
was revealed to them. 

Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle, 
partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and 
a little church whose stained-glass windows��ɫ������ 
were glowing jewel-bright across the 
square. 

The snow here had become impactedѹ����. It was hard and slippery where people had 
trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them, their figures briefly illuminated 
by streetlamps. They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; 
then they heard a carol start up inside the little church. 

 ��Harry, I think it��s Christmas Eve!�� said Hermione.

��232ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Is it?��

 He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks. 

��I��m sure it is,�� said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. ��They ... they��ll be in there, won��t 
they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.�� 

Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like fear. Now that he was so 
near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, 
because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling him forward. Halfway 
across the square, however, she stopped dead.

 ��Harry, look!�� 

She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had transformed. Instead of an 
obelisk����ʯ�� 
covered in names, there was a statue of three people, a man with untidy hair and 
glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother��s 
arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps. 

Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents�� faces. He had never imagined that there would be 
a statue... How strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on 
his forehead... 

��C'mon,�� said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again toward the church. As 
they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war 
memorial. 

The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harry��s throat constrict, it 
reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside 
suits of armor, of the Great Hall��s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had 
won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater... 

 There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it open as quietly as 
possible and they edged�����ƶ� 
through it. On either side of the slippery path to the church 
doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carving deep trenches 
behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant 
windows. 

Behind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue 
that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass

��233ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket, Harry moved 

toward the nearest grave. 

 ��Look at this, it��s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of Hannah��s!��

 ��Keep your voice down,�� Hermione begged him. 

They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the snow behind 

them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then squinting into the 

surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied.

 ��Harry, here!�� 

Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his heart positively 

banging in his chest.

 ��Is it �C?��

 ��No, but look!�� 

She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the frozen, lichen��̦޺ 
spotted 
granite, the words Kendra Dumbledore and, a short way down her dates of birth and death, 
and Her Daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation: 

Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 

So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The Dumbledore family had 
indeed lived here, and part of it had died here. 

Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking that he and 
Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, 
yet he had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a 
moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of 
how much it would have meant to him. But it seemed that, to Dumbledore, the fact that their 
families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, 
perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do. 

Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow. He read 
the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. He did not 
understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest member of

��234ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the family once his mother had died. 

 ��Are you sure he never mentioned �C?�� Hermione began. 

��No,�� said Harry curtly, then, ��let��s keep looking,�� and he turned away, wishing he had not 
seen the stone, He did not want his excited trepidation�־� 
tainted with resentment. 

��Here!�� cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness. ��Oh no, sorry! I 
thought it said Potter.��

 She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on her face.

 ��Harry, come back a moment.�� 

He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way back through the 

snow toward her. 

 ��What?�� 

��Look at this!�� The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make out 

the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it. 

 ��Harry, that��s the mark in the book!�� 

He peered at the place she indicated. The stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what 

was engraved there, though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible 

name.

 ��Yeah ... it could be... ��

 Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone. 

��It says Ig �C Ignotus, I think... �� 

��I��m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?�� Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, 
and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave. 

Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had met at Hogwarts. 
Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family represented in the 
graveyard. Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or the current members had 
moved away from Godric��s Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and every 
time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation. 

The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper. Harry looked 
around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the carols had finished, that the chatter 
and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square.

��235ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights. 

Then Hermione��s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and clear from a few 
yards away.

 ��Harry, they��re here ... right here.�� 

And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time, He moved toward her, 
feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest, the same sensation he had had right after 
Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs. 

The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana��s. It was made of white marble, 
just like Dumbledore��s tomb, and this made it easy to read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry 
did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it. 

JAMES POTTER LILY POTTER 
BORN 27 MARCH 1960 BORN 30 JANUARY 1960 
DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 


The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. 

Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to take in their 
meaning, and he read the last of them aloud. 

��'The last enemy that shall be defeated is death'.�� A horrible thought came to him, and with a 
kind of panic. ��Isn��t that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there?�� 

��It doesn��t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry,�� said Hermione, 
her voice gentle. ��It means ... you know ... living beyond death. Living after death.�� 

But they were not living, thought Harry. They were gone. The empty words could not disguise 
the fact that his parents�� moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. 
And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what 
was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, 
looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James 
lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart 
still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was 
sleeping under the snow with them.

��236ҳ��

Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He could not look at her, but 
returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying 
to regain control. He should have brought something to give them, and he had not thought of it, 
and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it 
in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them. Harry caught it 
and laid it on his parents�� grave. 

As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave. He did not think he could stand another moment 
there. He put his arm around Hermione��s shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they 
turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore��s mother and sister, back 
toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.

Chapter Seventeen 
Bathilda��s Secret 



"Harry, stop." 

"What's wrong?" 

They had only just reached the grave of the 


unknown 
Abbott. 
"There's someone there. Someone watching us. I 

can tell. There, 
over by the bushes." 
They stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense black boundary of the 

graveyard. Harry could not see anything. 

"Are you sure?" 

"I saw something move. I could have sworn I did...�� 

She broke from him to free her wand arm. 

"We look like Muggles," Harry pointed out. 

"Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave? Harry, I'm sure there's 

someone over there!" 

Harry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be haunted; what if -? But 
then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy���� 
of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione 
had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow. 

"It's a cat," said Harry, after a second or two, "or a bird. If it was a Death Eater we'd be dead by 
now. But let's get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on." 

They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. Harry, who did not 
feel as sanguine�ֹ۵�as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate 
and the slippery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves. The pub was 
fuller than before. Many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they 
approached the church. 

For a moment, Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say 
anything Hermione murmured, "Let's go this way," and pulled him down the dark street leading 
out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the

��238ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They walked as 
quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the outlines of 
Christmas trees dark through the curtains. 

"How are we going to find Bathilda's house?" asked Hermione, who was shivering a little and 
kept glancing back over her shoulder. "Harry? What do you think? Harry?" 

She tugged at this arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking toward the dark 
mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he sped up, dragging 
Hermione along with him, she slipped a little on the ice. 

"Harry -" 

"Look ... Look at it, Hermione ...�� 

"I don't ... oh!" 

He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had grown 
wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst 
the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in the dark ivy 
and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where 
the curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must 
once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it. 

"I wonder why nobody's ever rebuilt it?" whispered Hermione. 

"Maybe you can't rebuild it." Harry replied. "Maybe it's like the injuries from Dark Magic and 
you can't repair the damage." 

He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, not 
wishing to open it, but simply to hold some part of the house. 

"You're not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might - oh, Harry, look!" 

His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the ground in front of 
them, up thorough the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in 
golden letters upon the wood it said: 

On this spot, on this night of 31 October 1981, 
Lily and James Potter lost their lives. 
Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard


��239ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

ever to have survived the Killing Curse. 
This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left 
in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters 
and as a reminder of the violence 
that tore apart their family. 


And all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added by other witches and 
wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived had escaped. Some had merely 
signed their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into the wood, still others had 
left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen years' worth of magical 
graffiti, all said similar things. 

Good luck, Harry, wherever you are. 
If you read this, Harry, we're all behind you! 
Long live Harry Potter. 


"They shouldn't have written on the sign!" said Hermione, indignant. 

But Harry beamed at her. 

"It's brilliant. I'm glad they did. I ...�� 

He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted by the 
bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the figure was a 
woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground. Her stoop, 
her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as 
she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was 
passing, but he knew instinctively that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from 
them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them. 

He did not need Hermione's pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that this woman was 
a Muggle, She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to 
her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however, it was odd behavior to 
come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, 
meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the 
strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they were. Just as he had

��240ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

reached this uneasy conclusion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned. 

Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against his. 

"How does she know?" 

He shook his head. 

The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey 
the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that 
they stood facing each other in the deserted street. Was it possible that she had been waiting for 
them all these long months? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in 
the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had 
followed them to this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power 
that he had never encountered before. Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump. 

"Are you Bathilda?" 

The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again. 

Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry raised his eyebrows; 
Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod. They stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and 
hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. 
They followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just 
left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let 
them pass. 

She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house; Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her 
and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down 
with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue 
and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry's face. Her eyes were thick 
with cataracts������ 
and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with 
broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if she 
could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see. 

The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as she unwound a 
moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed 
clearly. 

"Bathilda?" Harry repeated.

��241ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it that 
sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, 
could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near? Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing 
Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting 
room. 

"Harry, I'm not sure about this," breathed Hermione. 

"Look at the size of her, I think we could overpower her if we had to," said Harry. "Listen, I 
should have told you, I knew she wasn't all there. Muriel called her 'gaga'." 

"Come!" called Bathilda from the next room. 

Hermione jumped and clutched Harry's arm. 

"It's okay," said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room. 

Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was still very dark, not to 
mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry's nose detected, 
underneath the dank��ʪ�� and mildewed��ù 
smell, something worse, like meat gone bad. He 
wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda's house to check whether she 
was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for she lit the candles 
clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire. 

"Let me do that," offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She stood watching him as 
he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously 
on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups. 

The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-frontedǰ���ǹ��ε� chest of 
drawers�嶷�� 
;�¹�on which there stood a large number of photographs. When the flame danced 
into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from 
the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered "Tergeo". The dust vanished 
from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most 
ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed them. Then the sight 
of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up. 

It was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had perched on Gregorovitch's 
windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where 
he had seen the boy before, in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage

Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs were, in Rita's book. 

"Mrs. - Miss - Bagshot?" he said, and his voice shook slightly. "Who is this?" 

Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for her. 

"Miss Bagshot?" Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the flames 

burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux beat faster upon his 

chest. 

"Who is this person?" Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward. 

She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry. 

"Do you know who this is?" he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual. "This 
man? Do you know him? What's he called?" 

Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had Rita Skeeter unlocked 
Bathilda's memories? 

"Who is this man?" he repeated loudly. 

"Harry, what area you doing?" asked Hermione. 

"This picture. Hermione, it's the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!" he said to 

Bathilda. "Who is this?" 

But she only stared at him. 

"Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. -Miss -Bagshot?" asked Hermione, raising her 
own voice. "Was there something you wanted to tell us?" 

Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to Harry. 
With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall. 

"You want us to leave?" he asked. 

She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at herself, then at the ceiling. 

"Oh, right... Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her." 

"All right," said Hermione, "let's go." 

But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor, once more pointing 
first at Harry, then to herself. "She wants me to go with her, alone." 

"Why?" asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room, the old 
lady shook her head a little at the loud noise. 

"Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?"

��243ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Do you really think she knows who you are?" 

"Yes," said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own. "I think she does." 

"Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry." 

"Lead the way," Harry told Bathilda. 

She seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him toward the door. Harry glanced 
back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; she stood hugging 
herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase. As Harry walked out of 
the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he slipped the silver-framed photograph of the 
unknown thief inside his jacket. 

The stairs were steep and narrow; Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout Bathilda's 
backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too 
likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, turned immediately right, and 
led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom. 

It was pitch-black and smelled horrible, Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from 
under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness. 

"Lumos," said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start, Bathilda had moved close to him in 
those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her approach. 

"You are Potter?" she whispered. 

"Yes, I am." 

She nodded slowly, solemnly. 

Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than his own heart. It was an unpleasant, agitating 

sensation. 

"Have you got anything for me?" Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-tip. 

"Have you got anything for me?" he repeated. 

Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once, Harry's scar prickled painfully; 
the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved 
momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice, Hold him! 

Harry swayed where he stood. The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around him again; 
he did not know what had just happened. 

"Have you got anything for me?" he asked for a third time, much louder. 

��244ҳ��

"Over here," she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the outline of 
a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window. 

This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade bed, his wand raised. 
He did not want to look away from her. 

"What is it?" he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what 
looked and smelled like dirty laundryҪϴ���·�. 

"There," she said, pointing at the shapeless mass. 

And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, 
she moved weirdly. He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror 
paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and a great snake pouring from the place where 
her neck had been. The snake struck as he raised his wand. The force of the bite to his forearm sent 
the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was 
extinguished; Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him, He 
fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing. 

He rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake's tail, which thrashed down upon the table 
where he had been a second earlier. Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the 
floor. From below he heard Hermione call, "Harry?" 

He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back, Then a heavy smooth mass smashed 

him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular... 

"No!" he gasped, pinned to the floor. 

"Yes," whispered the voice. "Yesss... hold you ... hold you ...�� 

"Accio ... Accio Wand ...�� 

But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled 
itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a 
circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his brain was flooding 
with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, distant footsteps, 
everything going... 

A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying, flying with triumph in his 
heart, without need of broomstick or thestral... 

He was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He scrambled

up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light. It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a 
shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered. Frozen air filled the room as 
Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like 
something - his wand. 

He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione 
was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang 
and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking Harry hard in the face as it went, 
coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared 
more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years. 

"He's coming! Hermione, he's coming!" 

As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos. It smashed shelves from the 
wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark 
shape he knew to be Hermione. 

She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed, The snake reared again, but Harry 
knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to 
split open with the pain from his scar. 

The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, 
Hermione screamed, "Confringo!" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe 
mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear 
the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt from bed to 
broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness, her scream 
reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair ... 

And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid 
bedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the 
little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled with the girl's, 
that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in Christmas Day... 

And his scream was Harry's scream, his pain was Harry's pain... that it could happen here, where 
it had happened before... here, within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing 
what it was to die ... to die ... the pain was so terrible ... ripped from his body ... But if he had no 
body, why did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how cold he feel so unbearably, didn't pain

cease with death, didn't it go ... 

The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square and the 
shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a world in which they 
did not believe ... And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him 
that he always knew on these occasions ... Not anger ... that was for weaker souls than he ... but 
triumph, yes ... He had waited for this, he had hoped for it ... 

"Nice costume, mister!" 

He saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, 
saw the fear cloud his painted face. Then the child turned and ran away ... Beneath the robe he 
fingered the handle of his wand ... One simple movement and the child would never reach his 
mother ... but unnecessary, quite unnecessary... 

And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, the 
Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet ... And he made less noise than the dead 
leaves, slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, and steered over it ... 

They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall 
black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the 
amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. 

The child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist ... 

A door opened and the mother entered, saying words he could not hear, her long dark-red hair 
falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother. He threw 
his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning... 

The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear. His white hand 
pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open... 

He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he had 
not even picked up his wand ... 

"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!" Hold him off, without a wand in 
his hand! ... He laughed before casting the curse ... 

"Avada Kedavra!" 

The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pramӤ���� 
pushed against the wall, it

made the banisters glow like lighting rods, and James Potter fell like a marionetteǣ��ľżwhose 
strings were cut ... 

He could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was sensible, 
she, at least, had nothing to fear ... 

He climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in ... 

She had no wand upon her either ... How stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their 

safety lay in friends, that weapons could be discarded even for moments... 

He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy 
wave of his wand ... and there she stood, the child in her arms. At the sight of him, she dropped her 
son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in shielding him 
from sight she hoped to be chosen instead ... 

"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!" 

"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now." 

"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead..." 

"This is my last warning." 

"Not Harry! Please ... have mercy���� 
... have mercy ... Not Harry! Not Harry! Please -I'll do 
anything ...�� 

"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!" 

He could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to finish them all ... 

The green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. The child had not 
cried all this time. He could stand, clutching the bars of his crib, and he looked up into the 
intruder's face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid 
beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop up any moment, laughing 
-

He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face. He wanted to see it happen, the 
destruction of this one inexplicable danger. The child began to cry. It had seen that he was not 
James. He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach (endure, tolerate) the small 
ones whining in the orphanage - 

"Avada Kedavra!" 

And then he broke. He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, not

here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped screaming, but far away ... far 
away ... 

"No," he moaned. 

The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy 
... 

"No...�� 

And now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda's house, immersed in memories of his 
greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass... He looked 
down and saw something... something incredible... 

"No...�� 

"Harry, it's all right, you're all right!" 

He stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he was, the unknown thief, the 
thief he was seeking... 

"No... I dropped it... I dropped it ...�� 

"Harry, it's okay, wake up, wake up!" 

He was Harry... Harry, not Voldemort ... and the thing that was rustling was not a snake ... He 
opened his eyes. 

"Harry," Hermione whispered. "Do you feel all - all right?" 

"Yes," he lied. 

He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets. He could tell that 

it was almost dawn by the stillness and quality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. He 

was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets. 

"We got away." 

"Yes," said Hermione. "I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk. I couldn't lift 
you. You've been ... Well, you haven't been quite ...�� 

There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand. 
She had been wiping his face. 

"You've been ill," she finished. "Quite ill." 

"How long ago did we leave?" 

"Hours ago. It's nearly morning."

��249ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"And I've been... what, unconscious?" 

"Not exactly," said Hermione uncomfortably. "You've been shouting and moaning and ... 
things," she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy. What had he done? Screamed curses like 
Voldemort, cried like the baby in the crib? 

"I couldn't get the Horcrux off you," Hermione said, and he knew she wanted to change the 
subject. "It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You've got a mark; I'm sorry, I had to use a Severing 
Charm to get it away. The snake hit you too, but I've cleaned the wound and put some dittany on 
it ...�� 

He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down. There was a 
scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. He could also see the half healed 
puncture marks to his forearm. 

"Where've you put the Horcrux?" 

"In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while." 

He lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face. 

"We shouldn't have gone to Godric's Hollow. It's my fault, it's all my fault. Hermione, I'm 
sorry." 

"It's not you fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might have left the sword 

there for you." 

"Yeah, well ... we got that wrong, didn't we?" 

"What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was the snake hiding 

somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attack you?" 

"No." he said. "She was the snake ... or the snake was her ... all along." 

"W-what?" 

He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda's house on him; it made the whole thing 
horribly vivid. 

"Bathilda must've been dead a while. The snake was ... was inside her. You-Know-Who put it 
there in Godric's Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I'd go back." 

"The snake was inside her?" 

He opened his eyes again. 

Hermione looked revolted, nauseated.

"Lupin said there would be magic we'd never imagined." Harry said. "She didn't want to talk in 
front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn't realize, but of course I 
could understand her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, 
I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there ... and then ...�� 

He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda's neck, Hermione did not need to know the 

details. 

"... she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked." 

He looked down at the puncture marks. 

"It wasn't supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who came." 

If he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been worth it, all of it ... Sick at heart, he 

sat up and threw back the covers. 

"Harry, no, I'm sure you ought to rest!" 

"You're the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible. I'm fine. I'll keep watch for a 

while. Where's my wand?" 

She did not answer, she merely looked at him. 

"Where's my wand, Hermione?" 

She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes. "Harry ..." 

"Where's my wand?" 

She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him. 

The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One fragile strand of phoenix feather 
kept both pieces hanging together. The wood had splintered apart completely. Harry took it into his 
hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury. He could not think 
properly. Everything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he held out the want to Hermione. "Mend 
it. Please." 

"Harry, I don't think, when it's broken like this -" 

"Please, Hermione, try!" 

"R-Reparo." 

The dangling half of the wand resealed itself. 

Harry held it up. "Lumos!" 

The wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at Hermione.

"Expelliarmus!" 

Hermione's wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The feeble attempt at magic was 
too much for Harry's wand, which split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in 
what he was seeing ... the wand that had survived so much ... 

"Harry." Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. "I'm so, so sorry. I think it 
was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting 
Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have - must have hit -" 

"It was an accident." said Harry mechanically. He felt empty, stunned. "We'll -we'll find a way 
to repair it." 

"Harry, I don't think we're going to be able to," said Hermione, the tears trickling down her face. 
"Remember ... remember Ron? When he broke his wand, crashing the car? It was never the same 
again, he had to get a new one." 

Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who 
was dead. How was he supposed to find himself a new wand? 

"Well," he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, "well, I'll just borrow yours for now, then. 
While I keep watch." 

Her face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand, and he left her sitting beside his 
bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her.

Chapter Eighteen 

The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore 

The sun was coming up. The pure, colorless 


vastness of the 
sky stretched over him, indifferent to him and his 

suffering. Harry 
sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep 

breath of clean 
air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over 

the sparkling 
snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest 

treasure on earth, 
yet he could not appreciate it. His senses had 

been spikedʹʧ
Ч 
by the calamity of losing his wand. He looked 

out over a valley 
blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming 

through the 
glittering silence. 

Without realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying to resist 
physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count; he had lost all bones 
in his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join 
those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally 
weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of his magical power had been torn from 
him. He knew exactly what Hermione would say if he expressed any of this. The wand is only as 
good as the wizard. But she was wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like 
the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the protection of the 
twin cores, and only now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting on it. 

He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without looking at them, tucked 
them away in Hagrid��s pouch around his neck. The pouch was now too full of broken and useless 
objects to take any more. Harry��s hand brushed the old Snitch through the moleskin and for a 
moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away. Impenetrable, unhelpful, 
useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind. 

And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him inside, wiping out 
every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that 
Godric��s Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were supposed to go back, that it

��253ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

was all part of some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore, but there was no map, no plan. 
Dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of 
terrors, alone and unaided. Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, 
and now, Harry had no wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely 
be easy now for Voldemort to find out who he was ... 

Voldemort had all the information now ... 

��Harry?�� 

Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. Her face streaked with 
tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky 

under her arm. 

��Thanks,�� he said, taking one of the cups. 

��Do you mind if I talk to you?�� 

��No,�� he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings. 

��Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well ... I��ve got the book.�� 

Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. 

��Where - how -?�� 

��It was in Bathilda��s sitting room, just lying there... This note was sticking out of the top of it.�� 

Hermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud. 

��'Dear Bally, Thanks for your help. Here��s a copy of the book, hope you like it. You said 

everything, even if you don��t remember it. Rita.' I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda 

was alive, but perhaps she wasn��t in any fit state to read it.�� 

��No, she probably wasn��t.�� 

Harry looked down upon Dumbledore��s face and experienced a surge of savage pleasure. Now 
he would know all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him, whether 
Dumbledore wanted him to or not. 

��You��re still really angry at me, aren��t you?�� said Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears 
leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face. 

��No,�� he said quietly. ��No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying to get us out 
of there alive, and you were incredible. I��d be dead if you hadn��t been there to help me.�� 

He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book. Its spine was stiff; it

had clearly never been opened before. He riffled through the pages, looking for photographs. He 
came across the one he sought almost at once, the young Dumbledore and his handsome 
companion, roaring with laughter at some long-forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the 
caption. 

Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother��s death, 
With his friend Gellert Grindelwald. 


Harry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His friend Grindelwald. 
He looked sideways at Hermione, who was still contemplating the name as though she could not 
believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry. 

��Grindelwald!�� 

Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages around them for a 
recurrence of that fatal name. He soon discovered it and read greedily, but became lost. It was 
necessary to go farther back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found himself at the start of 
a chapter entitled ��The Greater Good.�� Together, he and Hermione started to read: 

Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze of 
glory -Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-
Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal-Winner for 
Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. 
Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias ��Dogbreath�� Doge, the 
dim-witted but devoted sidekick he had picked up at school. 

The two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London, preparing to 
depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived bearing news of 
Dumbledore��s mother��s death. ��Dogbreath�� Doge, who refused to be interviewed for this 
book, has given the public his own sentimental version of what happened next. He 
represents��� 
Kendra��s death as a tragic blow, and Dumbledore��s decision to give up 
his expedition as an act of noble self-sacrifice. 

Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godric��s Hollow at once, supposedly to "care" for 
his younger brother and sister. But how much care did he actually give them?

the outskirts of Godric��s Hollow at that time. ��Ran wild. 'Course, with his mum and dad 
gone you��d have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don��t 
think Albus was fussed about him. I never saw them together, anyway.�� 

So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young brother? The answer, it 
seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. For though her first jailer had 
died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore. Her very 
existence continued to be known only to those few outsiders who, like ��Dogbreath�� 
Doge, could be counted upon to believe in the story of her "ill health". 

Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated 
magical historian who has lived in Godric��s Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course, 
had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the village. 
Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to Albus at Hogwarts, having been 
favorably impressed by his paper on trans-species transformation in Transfiguration 
Today. This initial contact led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family. At the 
time of Kendra��s death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric��s Hollow who was on 
speaking terms with Dumbledore��s mother. 

Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now 
dimmed. ��The fire��s lit, but the cauldron��s empty,�� as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in 
Enid Smeek��s slightly earthier phrase, ��She��s nutty as squirrel poo.�� Nevertheless, a 
combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough 
nuggets���� 
of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story. 

Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra��s premature death down to 
a backfiring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also 
parrots the family line on Ariana, calling her ��frail�� and ��delicate.�� On one subject, 
however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into procuring Veritaserum, for she, and 
she alone, knows the full story of the best-kept secret of Albus Dumbledore��s life. Now 
revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of 
Dumbledore, his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition into the oppression of

��256ҳ��

Muggles, even his devotion to his own family. 

The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric��s Hollow, now an 

orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her 

great-nephewֶ��, Gellert Grindelwald. 

The name of Grindelwald is justly famous. In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards 
of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a 
generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of 
terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here. 

Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the 
Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. 
Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, 
Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself no other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even 
Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to����the twisted experiments of 
Gellert Grindelwald, and he was expelled. 

Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald��s next movements is that he ��traveled 
around for some months.�� It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his 
great-aunt in Godric��s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for 
many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore. 

��He seemed a charming boy to me,�� babbles Bathilda, ��whatever he became later. 

Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own 

age. The boys took to each other at once.�� 

They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her that Albus Dumbledore sent 
Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night. 

��Yes, even after they��d spent all day in discussion -both such brilliant young boys, 
they got on like a cauldron on fire -I��d sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert��s 
bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him and he 
had to let Gellert know immediately!�� 

And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore��s fans will 

find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best 

friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.)

Gellert - 

Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES�� OWN GOOD 
-this, I think, is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, that 
power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. 
We must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build. 
Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our 
counter-arguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it 
follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary 
and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, 
because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.) 

Albus 

Astonished and appalled though his many admirers will be, this letter constitutes proof 
that Albus Dumbledore once dreamed of overthrowing the Statute of Secrecy and 
establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. What a blow for those who have always 
portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-borns�� greatest champion! How hollow those 
speeches promoting Muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How 
despicable does Albus Dumbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when he 
should have been mourning his mother and caring for his sister! 

No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal will bleat 

that he did not, after all, put his plans into action, that he must have suffered a change of 

heart, that he came to his senses. However, the truth seems altogether more shocking. 

Barely two months into their great new friendship, Dumbledore and Grindelwald 
parted, never to see each other again until they met for their legendary duel (for more, see 
chapter 22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore come to his senses? Had 
he told Grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans? Alas, no. 

��It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,�� says Bathilda. ��It came as an 

awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he came back to my 

house all of a dither (extreme agitation or excitement), told me he wanted to go home the

��258ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

next day. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I 
saw of him. 

��Albus was beside himself at Ariana��s death. It was so dreadful for those two brothers. 
They had lost everybody except for each other. No wonder tempers ran a little high. 
Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these dreadful circumstances. 
But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus��s nose 
at the funeral was not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting 
like that, across her daughter��s body. A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the 
funeral... He would have been a comfort to Albus, at least... 

This dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few who attended Ariana 
Dumbledore��s funeral, raises several questions. Why exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore 
blame Albus for his sister��s death? Was it, as ��Batty�� pretends, a mere effusion of grief? 
Or could there have been some more concrete reason for his fury? Grindelwald, expelled 
from Durmstrang for the near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country hours 
after the girl��s death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until 
forced to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world. 

Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this brief boyhood 
friendship in later life. However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for 
some five years of turmoil, fatalities and disappearances, his attack upon Gellert 
Grindelwald. Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of exposure as his once best 
friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set 
out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met? 

And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inadvertent victim of some Dark 
rite? Did she stumble across something she ought not to have done, as the two young men 
sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? Is it possible that Ariana 
Dumbledore was the first person to die ��for the greater good��? 

The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the bottom of the page 
before him. She tugged the book out of Harry��s hands, looking a little alarmed by his expression,

��259ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something indecent. 

��Harry -�� 

But he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside him; it was exactly as he 
had felt after Ron left. He had trusted Dumbledore, believed him the embodiment of goodness and 
wisdom. All was ashes. How much more could he lose? Ron, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand ... 

��Harry.�� She seemed to have heard his thoughts. "Listen to me. It -it doesn't make a very nice 
reading -" 

"Yeah, you could say that -" 

"- but don't forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter writing." 

"You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn't you?" 

"Yes, I -I did." She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold hands. "I think that's 
the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but 'For the Greater Good' became 
Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. And ... from that ... 
it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say 'For the Greater Good' was even carved over 
the entrance to Nurmengard." 

"What's Nurmengard?" 

"The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in there himself, once 
Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it's -it��s an awful thought that Dumbledore's ideas helped 
Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita can't pretend that they knew each 
other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young, and -" 

"I thought you'd say that," said Harry. He did not want to let his anger spill out at her, but it was 
hard to keep his voice steady. "I thought you'd say 'They were young.' They were the same age as 
we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle 
with his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles." 

His temper would not remain in check much longer. He stood up and walked around, trying to 
work some of it off. 

"I'm not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote," said Hermione. "All that 'right to rule' 
rubbish, it's 'Magic Is Might' all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck 
alone in the house -" 

"Alone? He wasn't alone! He had his brother and sister for company, his Squib sister he was

��260ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

keeping locked up -" 

"I don't believe it," said Hermione. She stood up too. "Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don't 
think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, ever have allowed -" 

"The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn't want to conquer Muggles by force!" Harry 
shouted, his voice echoing across the empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose into the air, 
squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky. 

"He changed, Harry, he changed! It's as simple as that! Maybe he did believe these things when 
he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! 
Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for Muggle 
protection and Muggle born rights, who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who died 
trying to bring him down!" 

Rita's book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus Dumbledore smiled 
dolefully at both. 

"Harry, I'm sorry, but I think the real reason you're so angry is that Dumbledore never told you 
any of this himself." 

"Maybe I am!" Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his head, hardly knowing whether he 
was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. 
"Look what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don't 
expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I'm doing, trust me 
even though I don't trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!" 

His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and 

emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky. 

"He loved you," Hermione whispered. "I know he loved you." 

Harry dropped his arms. 

"I don't know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn't love, the mess he's left 
me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than 
he ever shared with me." 

Harry picked up Hermione's wand, which he had dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the 
entrance of the tent. 

"Thanks for the tea. I'll finish the watch. You get back in the warm."

��261ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

She hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the book and then walked back past 
him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. He closed 
his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true, that Dumbledore 
had really cared.

Chapter Nineteen 
The Silver Doe 


It was snowing by the time Hermione took over 


the watch at 
midnight. 
Harry's dreams were confused and disturbing: 

Nagini wove 
in and out of them, first through a gigantic, cracked 

ring, then 
through a wreath of Christmas roses. 
He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that 

somebody 
had called out to him in the distance, imagining that 

the wind 
whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices. 

Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the 
tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand. The snow was falling thickly, and she 
greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on. 

"We'll go somewhere more sheltered," she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over 
her pajamas. "I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside. I even though I saw somebody 
one or twice." 

Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, motionless 
Sneakoscope on the table. 

"I'm sure I imagined it," said Hermione, looking nervous. "The snow in the dark, it plays tricks 
on your eyes. But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?" 

Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching 
the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed them; Harry's feet parted 
company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered in 
leaves. 

"Where are we?" he asked, peering around at the fresh mass of trees as Hermione opened the 

beaded bag and began tugging out the tent poles. 

 "The Forest of Dean," she said, "I came camping here once with my mum and dad." 

Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at least 

protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around

��263ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was adept at producing, and which could be scooped 
up and carried in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, 
an impression reinforced by Hermione's solicitousness (concern; great care). That afternoon fresh 
flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery 
snow. 

After two nights of little sleep, Harry's senses seemed more alert than usual. Their escape from 
Godric's Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more 
threatening. As darkness drove in again Harry refused Hermione's offer to keep watch and told her 
to go to bed. 

Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters he 
owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was 
virtually impenetrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder's Map, so as to watch 
Ginny's dot for a while, before he remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she 
would be back at the Burrow. 

Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew that it must 
be full of living creatures, but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could 
separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other sinister 
movements. He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and 
at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. Their protective enchantments 
had worked for weeks; why should they break now? And yet he could no throw off the feeling that 
something was different tonight. 

Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen asleep, slumped at an 
awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness 
that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparation and Apparation. He had just 
held a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened. 

A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. Whatever the 
source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift toward him. 

He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione's wand. He screwed 
up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch black in silhouette, and still

��264ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the thing came closer. 

And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver white doe, 
moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints 
in the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-
lashed eyes held high. 

Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but her inexplicable 
familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until this 
moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for Hermione, which had been so 
strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had come 
for him, and him alone.

 They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away.

 "No," he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. "Come back!" 

She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her brightness was striped by 
their thick black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a 
trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He 
set off in pursuit. 

Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees, for 
she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked 
quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her properly. And then she 
would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know. 

At last she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward him once more, and he broke 
into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished. 

Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still imprinted on his 
retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear 
came, her presence had meant safety.

 "Lumos!" he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited. 

The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, listening to 
the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be 
attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the 
reach of the wandlight, watching him?

��265ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light burst from behind a 
tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot? 

Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but all that was there was a 
small, frozen pool, its black, cracked surface glittering as he raised his wand higher to examine it. 

He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his distorted shadow 
and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray carapace�׿� 
,��, something else 
glinted. A great silver cross... 

His heart skipped into his mouth, He dropped to his knees at the pool's edge and angled the 
wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red... It 
was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt.The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the 
forest pool. 

Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could it have come to be 
lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic 
drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of 
guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely 
because they were here? In which case, where was the person who wanted to pass it to Harry? 
Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for 
the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened (2. 
influence, change) his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the 
bottom of the frozen pool.

 He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, "Accio Sword." 

It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy the sword would have lain on 
the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, 
thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible 
danger then, and had asked for help.

 "Help," he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless. 

What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time 
he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what 
were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry's head answered him, 
Their daring nerve and chivalry set Gryffindor apart.

��266ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the 
frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might 
come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice. 

He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was 
going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had 
plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because 
the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting. 

With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where "chivalry" 
entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that 
he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead. 

An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was 
shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood 
there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch containing his wand, his 
mother's letter, the shard of Sirius's mirror, and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed 
Hermione's wand at the ice. 

"Diffindo." 

It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence. The surface of the pool broke and chunks of 
dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve 
the sword he would have to submerge himself completely. 

Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer. He stepped to the 
pool's edge and placed Hermione's wand on the ground still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how 
much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering, he jumped. 

Every pore of his body screamed in protest. The very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as 
he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He could hardly breathe, trembling so 
violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade with his numb feet. He 
only wanted to dive once. 

Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and shaking, 
until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage, and dived. 

The cold was agony, it attacked him like fire. His brain itself seemed to have frozen as he 
pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers

��267ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

closed around the hilt; he pulled it upward. 

Then something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water weeds, though nothing had 
brushed him as he dived, and raised his hand to free himself. It was not weed, The chain of the 
Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe. 

Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface, but merely propelled 
himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, 
his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside his head, and he 
was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around 
his chest were surely Death's. 

Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he came to 
facedown in the snow. Somewhere, close by, another person was panting and coughing and 
staggering around, Hermione had come again, as she had come when the snake attacked... 

Yet it did not sound like her, not with those deep coughs, no judging by the weight of the 
footsteps. 

Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior's identity. All he could do was raise a 
shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was 
gone. Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from over his head.

 "Are - you - mental?" 

Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry the strength to get up. 
Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but 
drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the 
Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other. 

"Why the hell," panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backward and forward on its 
shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, "didn't you take the thing off before you dived?" 

Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with Ron's 
reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still 
lying at the water's edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after sweater over his 
head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, 
and yet he had to be real. He had just dived into the pool, he had saved Harry's life. 

"It was y-you?" Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual due to his

��268ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

near-strangulation.

 "Well, yeah," said Ron, looking slightly confused. 

 "Y-you cast that doe?" 

 "What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!" 

 "My Patronus is a stag." 

 "Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers." 

Harry put Hagrid's pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater, stooped to pick up 

Hermione's wand, and faced Ron again.

 "How come you're here?" 

 Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all. 

"Well, I've -you know -I've come back. If -" He cleared his throat. "-you know, you still want 
me." 

There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron's departure seemed to rise like a wall between 
them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved Harry's life. 

Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was 
holding. 

"Oh yeah, I got it out," he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword for Harry's 
inspection. "That's why you jumped in, right?" 

 "Yeah," said Harry. "But I don't understand. How did you get here? How did you find us?" 

"Long story," said Ron. "I've been looking for you for hours, it's a big forest, isn't it? And I was 

just thinking I'd have to go kip (British) sleep) under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that 

deer coming and you following."

 "You didn't see anyone else?" 

 "No," said Ron. "I -" 

 But he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away. 

"I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because 

you'd gone in and you hadn't come up, so I wasn't going to make a detour to - hey!" 

Harry was already hurrying to the place that Ron had indicated. The two oaks grew close 
together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level, an ideal place to see 
but not be seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no

sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the sword and the 

Horcrux. 

 "Anything there?" Ron asked. 

 "No," said Harry.

 "So how did the sword get in that pool?" 

 "Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there." 

They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from 

Hermione's wand. 

 "You reckon this is the real one?" asked Ron. 

 "One way to find out, isn't there?" said Harry. 

The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron's hand. The locket was twitching slightly. Harry 
knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had 
tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now 
was the moment to destroy once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione's wand high, 
and saw the place, a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree. 

"Come here." he said and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock's surface, and held out 

his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head. 

 "No, you should do it." 

 "Me?" said Ron, looking shocked. "Why?"

 "Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you." 

He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he 
knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry 
something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts. 

"I'm going to open it," said Harry, "and you will stab it. Straightaway okay? Because whatever's 
in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the Diary tried to kill me."

 "How are you going to open it?" asked Ron. He looked terrified 

"I'm going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue," said Harry. The answer came so readily to his 
lips that he thought he had always known it deep down. Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter 
with Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S, inlaid with glittering green 
stones. It was easy to visualize it as a miniscule snake, curled upon the cold rock. 

��270ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"No!" said Ron. "Don't open it! I'm serious!" 

 "Why not?" asked Harry. "Let's get rid of the damn thing, it's been months -" 

 "I can't, Harry, I'm serious. You do it." 

 "But why?" 

"Because that thing's bad for me!" said Ron, backing away from the locket on the rock. "I can't 
handle it! I'm not making excuses, Harry, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affects 
you and Hermione, it made me think stuff -stuff that I was thinking anyway, but it made 
everything worse. I can't explain it, and then I'd take it off and I'd get my head straight again, and 
then I'd have to put the effing thing back on - I can't do it Harry!"

 He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head. 

 "You can do it," said Harry, "you can! You've just got the sword. I know it's supposed to be you 
who uses it. Please just get rid of it, Ron." 

The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed, then still breathing hard 
through his long nose, moved back toward the rock. 

 "Tell me when," he croaked. 

"On three," said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes, concentrating 

on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped 

cockroach. It would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry's neck still burned. 

 "One ... two ... three ... open." 

The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide open 
with a little click. 

Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom 
Riddle's eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupiled

 "Stab," said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock. 

Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands. The point dangled over the frantically swiveling 

eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from 

the empty windows. 

 Then a voice hissed from out the Horcrux. 

"I have seen your heart, and it is mine." 

 "Don't listen to it!" Harry said harshly. "Stab it!" 

��271ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you desire is 
possible, but all that you dread is also possible." 

"Stab!" shouted Harry, his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, 
and Ron gazed down into Riddle's eyes. 

"Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter ... Least loved, now, by the girl who 
prefers your friend ... Second best (2. not of the best quality), always, eternally overshadowed ...�� 

"Ron, stab it now!" Harry bellowed, He could feel the locket quivering in the grip and was 
scared of what was coming. Ron raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, Riddle's eyes 
gleamed scarlet. 

Out of the locket's two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed like two grotesque bubbles, the 
heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted. 

Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first chests, 
then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, 
swaying over Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it 
burned, suddenly, white-hot. 

"Ron!" he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with Voldemort's voice and Ron 
was gazing, mesmerized, into its face. 

"Why return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of your absence. We 
laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption -" 

"Presumption!" echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more beautiful and yet more terrible 
than the real Hermione. She swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified, yet transfixed, 
the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. "Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, 
beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What are you, 
compared with the Boy Who Lived?" 

"Ron, stab it, STAB IT!" Harry yelled, but Ron did not move. His eyes were wide, and the 
Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected in them, their hair swirling like flames, their 
eyes shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet���س�/��. 

"Your mother confessed," sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-Hermione jeered, "that she would 
have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange...�� 

"Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to

him," crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around 
Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace. Their lips met. 

On the ground in front of them, Ron's face filled with anguish. he raised the sword high, his 
arms shaking.

 "Do it, Ron!" Harry yelled.

 Ron looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes.

 "Ron -?" 

The sword flashed, plunged, Harry threw himself out of the way, there as a clang of metal and a 
long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend 
himself, but there was nothing to fight. 

The monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone. There was only Ron, standing 
there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket 
on the flat rock. 

Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do. Ron was breathing 
heavily. His eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue, they were also wet. 

Harry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced 
the glass in both windows, Riddle's eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was 
smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished, torturing Ron had been its 
final act. The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms. He 
was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, 
knelt down beside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign 
that Ron did not throw it off. 

"After you left," he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron's face was hidden, "she 
cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads of nights when 
we never even spoke to each other. With you gone...�� 

He could not finish; it was now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his 
absence had cost them. 

"She's like my sister," he went on. "I love her like a sister and I reckon that she feels the same 
way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew." 

Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his

sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron's enormous rucksack lay yards away, 
discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He hoisted it onto his own 
back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but 
otherwise composed. 

"I'm sorry," he said in a thick voice. "I'm sorry I left. I know I was a - a -" 

He looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon him 
and claim him. 

"You've sort of made up for it tonight," said Harry. "Getting the sword. Finishing off the 
Horcrux. Saving my life." 

"That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was," Ron mumbled. 

"Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was" said Harry. "I've been trying to tell you 
that for years." 

Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back of Ron's 
jacket. 

"And now," said Harry as they broke apart, "all we've got to do is find that tent again." 

But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed 
lengthy, with Ron by his side, the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry 
could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent, 
Ron lagging a little behind him. 

It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination the bluebell flames 
still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, 
and did not move until Harry had said her name several times.

 "Hermione!" 

She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face. 

"What's wrong? Harry? Are you all right?" 

"It's okay, everything's fine. More than fine, I'm great. There's someone here." 

"What do you mean? Who -?" 

She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. Harry 
backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron's rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the 
canvas.

Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale 
face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak 
hopeful smile and half raised his arms. 

Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could 

reach. 

"Ouch - ow - gerroff! What the -? Hermione - OW!" 

"You - complete - arse - Ronald - Weasley!" 

She punctuated every word with a blow, Ron backed away, shielding his head as Hermione 

advanced. 

"You - crawl - back - here - after - weeks - and - weeks - oh, where's my wand?" 

She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry's hands and he reacted instinctively. 

"Protego!" 

The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The force of it knocked her backward 

onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she lept up again. 

 "Hermione!" said Harry. "Calm -" 

"I will not calm down!" she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; she 

looked quite demented. "Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!" 

"Hermione, will you please -" 

"Don't you tell me what do, Harry Potter!" she screeched. "Don't you dare! Give it back now! 
And YOU!" 

She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation. It was like a malediction���� 
, and Harry could not 
blame Ron for retreating several steps. 

"I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back" 

"I know," Ron said, "Hermione, I'm sorry, I'm really -" 

"Oh, you're sorry!" 

She laughed a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but Harry 
merely grimaced his helplessness. 

"You came back after weeks -weeks -and you think it's all going to be all right if you just say 
sorry?" 

"Well, what else can I say?" Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back.

"Oh, I don't know!" yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. "Rack your brains, Ron, that should 

only take a couple of seconds -" 

"Hermione," interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, "he just saved my -" 

"I don't care!" she screamed. "I don't care what he's done! Weeks and weeks, we could have 

been dead for all he knew -" 

"I knew you weren't dead!" bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the first time, and 
approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them. "Harry's all over the 
Prophet, all over the radio, they're looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental 
stories, I knew I'd hear straight off if you were dead, you don't know what it's been like -" 

 "What it's been like for you?? 

Her voice was not so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a level 
of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his opportunity. 

"I wanted to come back the minute I'd Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of 
Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn't go anywhere!" 

"A gang of what?" asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her arms and 
legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for several years. 

"Snatchers," said Ron. "They're everywhere -gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up Muggleborns 
and blood traitors, there's a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured. I was on my 
own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, thought I was a Muggle-born in 
hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry." 

"What did you say to them?" 

"Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of." "And they believed that?" 

"They weren't the brightest. One of them was definitely part 
troll, the smell of him." 

Ron glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of humor, but 
her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs. 

"Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but 
there were still five of them and only one of me, and they'd taken my wand. Then two of them got 
into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the 
stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. I didn't do it so

well. Splinched myself again -" Ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails, 
Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly "-and I came out miles from where you were. By the time I 
got back to that bit of riverbank where we'd been ... you were gone." 

"Gosh, what a gripping story," Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to 
wound. "You must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric's Hollow and, let's 
think, what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who's snake turned up, it nearly killed 
both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and missed us by about a second." 

"What?" Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him.

 "Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into perspective, doesn't it?" 

"Hermione," said Harry quietly, "Ron just saved my life." 

She appeared not to have heard him. 

"One thing I would like to know, though," she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron's 
head. "How exactly did you find us tonight? That's important. Once we know, we'll be able to 
make sure we're not visited by anyone else we don't want to see." 

Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. "This." 

 She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them.

 "The Deluminator?" she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce. 

"It doesn't just turn the lights on and off," said Ron. "I don't know how it works or why it 
happened then and not any other time, because I've been wanting to come back ever since I left. 

But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard ... I heard you." 

He was looking at Hermione. 

"You heard me on the radio?" she asked incredulously. 

"No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice," he held up the Deluminator again, 
"came out of this." 

"And what exactly did I say?" asked Hermione, her tone somewhere between skepticism and 
curiosity. 

"My name. 'Ron.' And you said ... something about a wand." 

Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered, it had been the first time Ron's 
name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left. Hermione had mentioned it 
when talking about repairing Harry's wand. 

��277ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"So I took it out," Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, "and it didn't seem different or 
anything, but I was sure I'd heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but 
another light appeared right outside the window." 

Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something neither 
Harry nor Hermione could see. 

"It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you 
know?" 

"Yeah," said Harry and Hermione together automatically. 

"I knew this was it," said Ron. "I grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I put on my rucksack and 
went out into the garden. 

"The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it bobbed along 
a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it ... well, it went inside me." 

"Sorry?" said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly. 

"It sort of floated toward me," said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index finger, 
"right to my chest, and then - it just went straight through. It was here," he touched a point close to 
his heart, "I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me, I knew what I was supposed to do. 
I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a 
hill. There was snow everywhere." 

"We were there," said Harry. "We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I 
could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!" 

"Yeah, well, that would've been me," said Ron. "Your protective spells work, anyway, because I 
couldn't see you and I couldn't hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in 
my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you'd have to show yourselves 
when you packed up the tent." 

"No, actually," said Hermione. "We've been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an 
extra precaution. And we left really early, because as Harry says, we'd heard somebody blundering 
around." 

"Well, I stayed on that hill all day," said Ron. "I kept hoping you'd appear. But when it started to 
get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came 
out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn't see

you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end -and Harry did. Well, I 

saw the doe first, obviously." 

"You saw the what?" said Hermione sharply. 

They explained what had happened and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool 
unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to 
keep her limbs locked together. 

"But it must have been a Patronus!" she said. "Couldn't you see who was casting it? Didn't you 
see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can't believe this! Then what happened?" 

Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool, and had waited for him to 
resurface; how he had realized that something was wrong, dived in and saved Harry, then returned 
for the sword. He got as far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and Harry cut in. 

"- and Ron stabbed it with the sword." 

"And ... and it went? Just like that?" she whispered. 

"Well, it - it screamed," said Harry with half a glance at Ron. "Here." 

He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows. 

Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of 
Hermione's wand and turned to Ron. "Did you just say now that you got away from the snatchers 

with a spare wand?" 

"What?" said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket. "Oh - oh yeah." 

He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short dark wand out of his pocket. "Here, 

I figured it's always handy to have a backup." 

"You were right," said Harry, holding out his hand. "Mine's broken." 

"You're kidding?" Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked 
apprehensive again. 

Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into her bed and 
settled down without another word. 

Ron passed Harry the new wand. 

"About the best you could hope for, I think," murmured Harry. 

"Yeah," said Ron. "Could've been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?" 

"I still haven't ruled it out," came Hermione's muffled voice from beneath her blankets, but

Harry had not expected Hermione's anger

with Harry, 

however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became 
shamelessly cheery. 

"Someone helped us," he kept saying, "Someone sent that doe, Someone's on our side, One 
Horcrux down, mate!" 

Bolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible locations of the other 
Horcruxes even though they had discussed the matter so often before. Harry felt optimistic, certain 
that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione's sulkiness could not mar his buoyant 
spirits. The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery 
of Gryffindor��s sword, and above all, Ron's return made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult 
to maintain a straight face. 

Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione's baleful presence again and under the 
pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing 
exchange of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione's 
various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric's Hollow; Ron was 
now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during his 
weeks away. 

"... and how did you find out about the Taboo?" he asked Harry after explaining the many 
desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry." 

"The what?"

"You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who's name!" 

"Oh, yeah, well, it's just a bad habit we've slipped into," said Harry. "But I haven't got a problem 
calling him V -" 

"NO!" roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book 
at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. "Sorry," said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the 
brambles, "but the name's been jinxed, Harry, that's how they track people! Using his name breaks 
protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance -it's how they found us in 
Tottenham Court Road!" 

"Because we used his name?" 

"Exactly! You've got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious 
about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who even dared use it. Now they've put a Taboo on it, 
anyone who says it is trackable -quick-and-easy way to find Order members! They nearly got 
Kingsley -" 

"You're kidding?" 

"Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his way out. He's on the 
run now just like us." Ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand. "You don't 
reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?" 

"His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?" 

"Oh yeah...�� They moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione. "Harry... 
you don't reckon it could've been Dumbledore?" 

"Dumbledore what?" 

Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, "Dumbledore ... the doe? I mean," Ron 

was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, "he had the real sword last, didn't he? 

Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing behind the question. 

The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them, 

would have inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head. "Dumbledore��s dead," he said. "I saw it 

happen, I saw the body. He's definitely gone. Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe" 

"Patronuses can change, though can't they?" said Ron, "Tonks��s changed didn't it?" 

"Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn't he show himself? Why wouldn't he just hand 

us the sword?

"Search me," said Ron. "Same reason he didn't give it to you while he was alive? Same reason 

he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kid's stories." 

"Which is what?" asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face desperate for the answer. 

"I dunno," said Ron. "Sometimes I've thought, when I've been a bit hack off (upset), he was 
having a laugh or -or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don't think so, not anymore. 
He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn't he? He -well," Ron's ears 
turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his 
toe, "he must've known I'd run out on you." 

"No," Harry corrected him. "He must've known you'd always want to come back." 

Ron looked grateful, but still awkward. 

Partly to change the subject, Harry said, "Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what 
Skeeter wrote about him?" 

"Oh yeah," said Ron at once, "people are talking about it quite a lot. 'Course, if things were 
different it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it's just something 
to laugh about for people who didn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone 
who thought he was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, though. He was really 
young when they -" 

"Our age," said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to 
decide Ron against pursuing the subject. 

A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry took aim at it with the 
wand Ron had given him the previous night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, 
and had decided was made of blackthorn. "Engorgio." The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing 
slightly in the web. Harry tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger. 

"Stop that," said Ron sharply, "I'm sorry I said Dumbledore was young, okay?" 

Harry had forgotten Ron's hatred of spiders. "Sorry -Reducio." The spider did not shrink. Harry 
looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had 
seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt 
intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of his arm. 

"You just need to practice," said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind 
and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. "It��s all a matter

of confidence Harry." 

He knew why she wanted it to be all right. She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit 
back the retort that sprung to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it 
made no difference, and he would have hers instead. 

Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a 
tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more. All three of them 
returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried 
to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier 
and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, 
after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and 
started to try to tune it. 

"There's this one program," he told Harry in a low voice, "that tells the news like it really is. All 
the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are following the Ministry line, but this one ... you 
wait till you hear it, it's great. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing 
locations in case they're raided and you need a password to tune in ... Trouble is, I missed the last 
one...�� 

He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random words under his 
breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the 
notice she took of him he might not have been there. 

For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her book, and 
Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand. Finally Hermione climbed down from her 
bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once. "If it's annoying you, I'll stop!" he told Hermione nervously. 

Hermione did not deign (condescend) to respond, but approached Harry. 

"We need to talk," she said. 

He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. 

"What?" he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in 
there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita's version of his relationship with Dumbledore. 

Hermione's answer however, was completely unexpected. "I want to go and see Xenophilius 
Lovegood." 

He stared at her. "Sorry?"

��284ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna��s father. I want to go and talk to him!�� 

��Er �C why?�� 

She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, ��It��s that mark, the mark in Beedle 
the Bard. Look at this!�� 

She thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry��s unwilling eyes and saw a 
photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore��s 
familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had 
written those words, that they had not been Rita��s invention. 

��The signature,�� said Hermione. ��Look at the signature, Harry!�� 

He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely 
with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny 
version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard. 

��Er �C what are you -?�� said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned 
back to Harry. 

��It keeps cropping up, doesn��t it?�� she said. ��I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald��s mark, but 
it was definitely on that old grave in Godric��s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long 
before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can��t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald 
what it means �C I don��t even know whether Grindelwald��s still alive �C but we can ask Mr. 
Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I��m sure this is important, Harry!�� 

Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and then out into the 
surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, ��Hermione, we don��t need another 
Godric��s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and �C�� 

��But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you 
know we��re not supposed to find out about the sign?�� 

��Here we go again!�� Harry felt slightly exasperated. ��We keep trying to convince ourselves 
Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues �C�� 

��The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,�� piped up Ron. ��I think Hermione��s right, I 
think we ought to go and see Lovegood.�� 

Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron��s support of Hermione had little to do 
with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. 

��285ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It won��t be like Godric��s Hollow,�� Ron added, ��Lovegood��s on your side, Harry, The 

Quibbler��s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they��ve got to help you!��

 ��I��m sure this is important!�� said Hermione earnestly.

 ��But don��t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?�� 

��Maybe ... maybe it��s something you need to find out for yourself,�� said Hermione with a faint 

air of clutching at straws. 

 ��Yeah,�� said Ron sycophantically, ��that makes sense.�� 

��No, it doesn��t,�� snapped Hermione, ��but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A 

symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric��s Hollow. Harry, I��m sure we ought to 

know about this!��

 ��I think we should vote on it,�� said Ron. ��Those in favor of going to see Lovegood �C�� 

His hand flew into the air before Hermione��s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her 
own. 

��Outvoted, Harry, sorry,�� said Ron, clapping him on the back. 

��Fine,�� said Harry, half amused, half irritated�ֿ����ֺ�Ц 
. ��Only, once we��ve seen 
Lovegood, let��s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegood��s live, 
anyway? Do either of you know? 

��Yeah, they��re not far from my place,�� said Ron. ��I dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad 
always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn��t be hard to find.��

 When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice. 

 ��You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.�� 

��All's fair in love and war,�� said Ron brightly, ��and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it��s the 

Christmas holidays, Luna��ll be home!�� 

They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchopole from the breezy hillside to 
which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point the village looked like a 
collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks 
between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow, their hands shadowing 
their eyes, but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard, which 
afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes.

��286ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It��s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,�� said Ron. 

��Well, it��s not like you haven��t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,�� said Hermione 
coldly. 

��I wasn��t at the Burrow!�� said Ron with an incredulous laugh. ��Do you think I was going to go 
back there and tell them all I��d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and George would��ve been great 
about it. And Ginny, she��d have been really understanding.��

 ��But where have you been, then?�� asked Hermione, surprised. 

��Bill and Fleur��s new place. Shell cottage. Bill��s always been decent to me. He �C he wasn��t 
impressed when he heard what I��d done, but he didn��t go on about it. He knew I was really sorry. 
None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren��t going home 
for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You know, first holiday after they were 
married. I don��t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.��

 Ron turned his back on the Burrow. 

 ��Let��s try up here,�� he said, leading the way over the top of the hill. 

They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione��s insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility 
Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage, which 
seemed deserted. 

��Do you think it��s theirs, and they��ve gone away for Christmas?�� said Hermione, peering 
through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. 

Ron snorted. ��Listen, I��ve got a feeling you��d be able to tell who lived there if you looked 
through the Lovegoods�� window. Let��s try the next lot of hills.��

 So they Disapparated a few miles farther north. 

��Aha!�� shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was pointing upward, 
toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose 
vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the 
afternoon sky. ��That��s got to be Luna��s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks 
like a giant rook����ѻ����ѻ; (Chess) castle - ��!��

 ��It��s nothing like a bird,�� said Hermione, frowning at the tower. 

 ��I was talking about a chess rook,�� said Ron. ��A castle to you.�� 

Ron��s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When Harry and Hermione

��287ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they found him grinning broadly.

 ��It��s theirs,�� said Ron. ��Look.��

 Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broke-down gate. 

The first read: THE QUIBBLER. EDITOR, X. LOVEGOOD 

the second: PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE 

the third: KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS 

The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door was 
overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in orange radishlike fruit Luna 
sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened 
stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of leaves but still 
heavy with berry-sized red fruits, and bushy crowns of white beaded mistletoe stood sentinel on 
either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened hawk-like head peered down at 
them from one of the branches. 

��You��d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,�� said Hermione. ��It��s you Mr. Lovegood 
wants to help, not us.�� 

He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She then rapped 
three times on the thick black door, which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped 
like an eagle. 

Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, 
barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was 
dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur's wedding by 
comparison. 

"What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?" he cried in a high-pitched, querulous 
voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open 
in a perfect, comical O. 

"Hello, Mr. Lovegood," said Harry, holding out his hand, "I'm Harry, Harry Potter." 

Xenophilius did not take Harry's hand, although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose

��288ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

slid straight to the scar on Harry's forehead. 

"Would it be okay if we came in?" asked Harry. "There's something we'd like to ask you." 

"I ... I'm not sure that's advisable," whispered Xenophilius. He swallowed and cast a quick look 

around the garden. "Rather a shock... My word... I ...I'm afraid I don't really think I ought to -" 

"It won't take long" said Harry, slightly disappointed by this less-than-warm welcome. 

"I - oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!" 

They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them. 
They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly 
circular, so that he felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls the 
stove, the sink, and the cupboards -and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and 
birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he recognized Luna's styles. The effect, in such an 
enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming. 

In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper levels. There was a 
great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead, Harry wondered what Luna could be 
doing. 

"You'd better come up." said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable, and he led the 
way. 

The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and, as such, was 
even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller and entirely round, the room 
somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had 
transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were 
piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures Harry 
did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling. 

Luna was not there. The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in 
magically turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of 
shelves, but after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the 
fact that it was churning out Quibblers. 

"Excuse me," said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized grubbily tablecloth 
from beneath an immense number of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the floor, and 
threw it over the press, somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.

��289ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Why have you come here?" Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry 

of shock. 

"Mr. Lovegood - what's that?" 

She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been 

mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room. 

"It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack," said Xenophilius. 

"No it isn't!" said Hermione. 

"Hermione," muttered Harry, embarrassed, "now's not the moment -" 

"But Harry, it's an Erumpent horn! It's a Class B Tradeable Material and it's an extraordinary 
dangerous thing to have in a house!" 

"How'd you know it's an Erumpent horn?" asked Ron, edging away from the horn as fast as he 
could, given the extreme clutter of the room. 

"There's a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to 
get rid of it straightaway, don't you know it can explode at the slightest touch?" 

"The Crumple Horned Snorkack," said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish look upon his face, 
��is a shy and highly magical creature, and it's horn -" 

"Mr. Lovegood. I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that's an Erumpent horn and 
it's incredibly dangerous - I don't know where you got it -" 

"I bought it," said Xenophilius dogmatically. "Two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard 
who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now," he 
said, turning to Harry, "why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?" 

"We need some help," said Harry, before Hermione could start again. 

"Ah," said Xenophilius, "Help, Hmm." 

His good eye moved again to Harry's scar. He seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized. 

"Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather dangerous...�� 

"Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?" said Ron. "In 
that magazine of yours?" 

Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging and clattering 
beneath the tablecloth. 

"Er - yes, I have expressed that view. However -" 

��290ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"That's for everyone else to do, not you personally?" said Ron. 

Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. 
Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle. 

"Where's Luna?" asked Hermione. "Let's see what she thinks." 

Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steelingʹ��ǿ 
,ʹ�¾��� 
himself. Finally he said in a 
shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, "Luna is down at the stream, 
fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She... she will like to see you. I'll go and call her and then -yes, 
very well. I shall try to help you." 

He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front open and close. They looked 

at each other. 

"Cowardly old wart," said Ron. "Luna's got ten times his guts." 

"He's probably worried about what'll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here" 
said Harry. 

"Well, I agree with Ron," said Hermione, "Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help 
you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven's sake keep away from that horn." 

Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering 
ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the 
window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. 
Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than they had been since 
Bill and Fleur's wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, thinking of 
her. He suppose he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, 
Xenophilius's attitude proved that. 

He turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon 
the cluttered, curved slide board; a stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a 
most bizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets����״������ 
curved out from the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran 
over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around 
her forehead. 

"Look at this," said Harry. 

"Fetching," said Ron. "Surprised he didn't wear that to the wedding." 

��291ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius climbed back up the spiral 
staircase into the room, his thin legs now encase in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted 
teacups and a steaming teapot. 

"Ah, you have spotted my pet invention," he said, shoving the tray into Hermione's arms and 
joining Harry at the statue's side. "Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful 
Rowens Ravenclaw, 'Wit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure!'" 

He indicated the objects like ear trumpets. "These are the Wrackpurt siphons -to remove all 
sources of distraction from the thinker's immediate area. Here," he pointed out the tiny wings, "a 
billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind�ľ� 
/��. Finally," he pointed to the orange 
radish, "the dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary." 

Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to balance precariously 
on one of the cluttered side tables. 

"May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?" said Xenophilius. "We make it ourselves." As 
he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice, he added, "Luna is 
down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She ought not to be too long, 
she has caught nearly enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help 
yourselves to sugar. 

"Now," he remove a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned 
legs crossed, "how may I help you, Mr. Potter?" 

"Well," said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly, "it's about that symbol 
you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur's wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered 
what it meant." 

Xenophilius raised his eyebrows. "Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?"

Chapter Twenty-One 
The Tale of the Three Brothers 


Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. 


Neither of 
them seemed to have understood what 
Xenophilius had said either. 

"The Deathly Hallows?" 

"That's right," said Xenophilius. "You haven't 

heard of 
them? I'm not surprised. Very, very few wizards 

believe. 

Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother's wedding," he nodded at Ron, "who 
attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is 
nothing Dark about the Hallows �C at least not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to 
reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest." 

He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some. 

"I'm sorry," said Harry, "I still don't really understand." 

To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged. The stuff was quite disgusting, 
as though someone had liquidized booger-flavored Every Flavor Beans. 

"Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows," said Xenophilius, smacking his lips in 

apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. 

"But what are the Deathly Hallows?" asked Hermione. 

Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. 

"I assume that you are familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'?" 

Harry said, "No," but Ron and Hermione both said, "Yes." Xenophilius nodded gravely. 

"Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers' ... I have a 
copy somewhere ...�� 

He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, 
"I've got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I've got it right here." 

And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. 

"The original?" inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, "Well then, why 

don't you read it out aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all understand."

��293ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Er... all right," said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol 

they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read. 

"'There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight �C'" 

"Midnight, our mum always told us," said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to 

listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. 

"Sorry, I just think it's a bit spookier if it's midnight!" said Ron. 

"Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives," said Harry before he could stop 
himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window 
at the sky. "Go on, Hermione." 

"In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim 
across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their 
wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when 
they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. 

"'And Death spoke to them �C'" 

"Sorry," interjected Harry, "but Death spoke to them?" 

"It's a fairy tale, Harry!" 

"Right, sorry. Go on." 

"'And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of the three new victims, 
for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate 
the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever 
enough to evade him. 

"'So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in 
existence, a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had 
conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree�ӹ�ľ on the banks of the river, fashioned a 
wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother. 

"'Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate 
Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a 
stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have 
the power to bring back the dead. 

"'And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest

��294ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he 
asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by 
Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.'" 

"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?" Harry interrupted again. 

"So he can sneak up on people," said Ron. "Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, 
flapping his arms and shrieking ... sorry, Hermione." 

"'Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did 
so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring Death's gifts. 

"'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. 

"'The first brother traveled on for a week more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a 
fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he 
could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor the oldest 
brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from 
Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. 

"'That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden upon his 

bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure (in addition to), slit the oldest brother's throat. 

"'And so Death took the first brother for his own. 

"'Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took 
out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his 
amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely 
death, appeared at once before him. 

"'Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the 
mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad 
with hopeless longing, killed himself so as to truly join her. 

"'And so Death took the second brother for his own. 

"'But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find 
him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the 
Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And the he greeted Death as an old friend, and went 
with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.'" 

Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that

��295ҳ��

she had stopped reading; then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, "Well, there you 

are." 

"Sorry?" said Hermione, sounding confused. 

"Those are the Deathly Hallows," said Xenophilius. 

He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from 

between more books. 

"The Elder Wand," he said, and drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. "The 
Resurrection Stone," he said, and added a circle on top of the line. "The Cloak of Invisibility," he 
finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbols that so intrigued 
Hermione. "Together," he said, "the Deathly Hallows." 

"But there's no mention of the words 'Deathly Hallows' in the story," said Hermione. 

"Well, of course not," said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. "That is a children's tale, told to 
amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize that 
the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor 
master of Death." 

There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was 

low in the sky. 

"Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon," he said quietly. 

"When you say 'master of Death'..."said Ron. 

"Master," said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. "Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you 

prefer." 

"But then ... do you mean ...�� said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to 
keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, "that you believe these objects �C these Hallows �C 
really exist?" 

Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. "Well, of course." 

"But," said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, "Mr. Lovegood, how 
can you possibly believe �C?" 

"Luna has told me all about you, young lady," said Xenophilius. "You are, I gather, not 
unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded." 

"Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione," said Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing. 

"Mr. Lovegood," Hermione began again, "We all know that there are such things as Invisibility 
Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But �C" 

"Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a 
traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else 
woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns 
opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, 
and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are 
cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?" 

Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever. 
She, Harry and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same 
thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the 
room with them at that very moment. 

"Exactly," said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. "None of you 

have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?" 

He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink. 

"All right," said Hermione, disconcerted. "Say the Cloak existed... what about that stone, Mr. 

Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?" 

"What of it?" 

"Well, how can that be real?" 

"Prove that is not," said Xenophilius. 

Hermione looked outraged. 

"But that's �C I'm sorry, but that's completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn't 
exist? Do you expect me to get hold of �C of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you 
could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody's proved it doesn't 
exist!" 

"Yes, you could," said Xenophilius. "I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little." 

"So the Elder Wand," said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, "you think that exists 
too?" 

"Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence," said Xenophilius. "The Elder Wand is the

��297ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand." 

"Which is what?" asked Harry. 

"Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be 
truly master of it," said Xenophilius. "Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert 
the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after 
his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from 
Baraabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the 
pages of Wizarding history." 

Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him. 

"So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?" asked Ron. 

"Alas, who knows?" said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. "Who knows where the 
Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them 
really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? 
History, alas, does not tell us." 

There was a pause. 

Finally Hermione asked stiffly, "Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do 
with the Deathly Hallows?" 

Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry's memory, but he could not locate 
it. Peverell... he had heard that name before... 

"But you have been misleading me, young woman!" said Xenophilius, now sitting up much 
straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. "I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! 
Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything �C everything! �C to do with the 
Hallows!" 

"Who are the Peverells?" asked Ron. 

"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric's Hollow," said Hermione, still 
watching Xenophilius. "Ignotus Peverell." 

"Exactly!" said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedanticallyѧ��ʽ�� ;��Ūѧ�ʵ�. "The 
sign of the Death Hallows on Ignotus's grave is conclusive proof!" 

"Of what?" asked Ron. 

"Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch,

��298ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cadmus and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!" 

With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the 
spiral staircase. 

"You will stay for dinner?" he called, as he vanished downstairs again. "Everybody always 
requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimply soup." 

"Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo's," said Ron under his breath. 

Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before 

speaking. 

"What do you think?" he asked Hermione. 

"Oh, Harry," she said wearily, "it's a pile of utter rubbish. This can't be what the sign really 

means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time." 

"I s'pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks," said Ron. 

"You didn't believe it either?" Harry asked him. 

"Nah, that story's just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn't it? 'Don't go 
looking for trouble, don't go pick fights, don't go messing around with stuff that's best left alone! 
Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be okay'. Come to think of it," Ron 
added, "maybe that's story's reason why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"One of those superstitions, isn't it? 'May-born witches will marry Muggles.' 'Jinx by twilight, 
undone by midnight.' 'Wand of cider, never prosper.' You must have heard them. My mum's full of 
them." 

"Harry and I were raised by Muggles," Hermione reminded him. "We were taught different 
superstitions." She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one 
good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget 
that she was annoyed at Ron. "I think you're right," she told him. "It's just a morality tale, it's 
obvious which gift is best, which one you'd choose �C" 

The three of them spoke at the same time, Hermione said, "the Cloak," Ron said, "the wand," 

and Harry said, "the stone." 

They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused. 

"You're supposed to say the Cloak," Ron told Hermione, "but you wouldn't need to be invisible

��299ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!" 

 "We've already got an Invisibility Cloak," said Harry. 

"And it's helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn't noticed!" said Hermione. "Whereas the wand 

would be bound to attract trouble -" 

"Only if you shouted about it," argued Ron. "Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around 
waving it over your head, and singing, 'I've got an unbeatable want, come and have a go if you 
think you're hard enough.' As long as you kept your trap (Slang) mouth shut -" 

"Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?" said Hermione, looking skeptical. "You know the 
only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for 
hundreds of years." 

"There have?" asked Harry. 

Hermione looked exasperated. The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron 
grinned at each other. "The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names 
through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who��s boasting about them. 
Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but -oh it's all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as 
the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than 
other people's." 

"But how do you know," said Harry, "that those wands -the Deathstick, and the Wand of 

Destiny - aren't the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?" 

"What, and they're all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?" said Ron. 

Harry laughed. The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all, ridiculous. His wand, he 
reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it 
had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies and if it had been unbeatable, how 
could it have been broken? 

"So why would you take the stone?" Ron asked him. 

"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius... Mad-Eye... Dumbledore... my 
parents...�� 

Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled. 

"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn't want to come back, would they?" said Harry, 

thinking about the tale they had just heard. "I don't suppose there have been loads of other stories

��300ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?" he asked Hermione. 

"No," she replied sadly. "I don't think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that's 
possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer's Stone; you know, instead of a stone to 
make you immortal, a stone to reverse death." 

The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger. It was something like burning underpants. 
Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking 
to spare���˺�his feelings. 

"What about the Cloak, though?" said Ron slowly. "Don't you realize, he's right? I've got so 
used to Harry's Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I've never heard of one like 
Harry's. It's infallible. We've never been spotted under it -" 

"Of course not - we're invisible when we're under it, Ron!" 

"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they're not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is 
true! It's never occurred to me before but I've heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when 
they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they've got holes. Harry's was owned by his 
dad, so it's not exactly new, is it, but it's just ... perfect!" 

"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone...�� 

As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching the 
spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face 
was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a moment's bewilderment, he 
realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to clime the stairs. 

"Harry, what are you doing? I don't think you should look around when he's not here!" 

But Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five 
beautifully painted faces, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the 
portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them all the same. Harry thought 
they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them 
together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually 
one work repeated a thousand times in golden ink, friends... friends... friends... Harry felt a great 
rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a large photograph beside the 
bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked 
rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty.

��301ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet 
was also thick with dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed 
had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched 
over the nearest window across the blood red sky. 

"What's wrong?" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, 

Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls. 

"Mr. Lovegood," said Harry. "Where's Luna?" 

"Excuse me?" 

"Where's Luna?" 

Xenophilius halted on the top step. "I -I've already told you. She is down at the Botions Bridge 

fishing for Plimpies." 

"So why have you only laid that tray for four?" 

Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued chugging
���������� of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius's hands shook. 

"I don't think Luna's been here for weeks." said Harry. "Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn't 
been slept in. Where is she? and why do you keep looking out of the window?" 

Xenophilius dropped the tray. The bowls bounced and smashed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
drew their wands. Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the 
printing press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming across the floor from 
underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last. 

Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. 

Lovegood. 

"Harry, look at this." 

He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. The front of the Quibbler 
carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words "Undesirable Number One" and captioned 
with the reward money. 

"The Quibbler's going for a new angle, then?" Harry asked coldly, his mind working very fast. 
"Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to 
the Ministry?�� 

Xenophilius licked his lips.

��302ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"They took my Luna," he whispered, "Because of what I've been writing. They took my Luna 
and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her back to me if I If 
I -" 

"Hand over Harry?" Hermione finished for him. 

"No deal." said Ron flatly. "Get out of the way, we're leaving." 

Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer. 

"They will be here any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave." He 
spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the 

same thing in front of his crib. 

"Don't make us hurt you," Harry said. "Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood." 

"HARRY!" Hermione screamed. 

Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from 
him. Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time. He launched himself 
sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as Xenophilius's Stunning Spell soared 
across the room and hit the Erumpent horn. There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it 
seemed to blow the room apart. Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, 
along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to 
the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard Hermione's 
scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him that Xenophilius had 
been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. Half buried in rubble, Harry 
tried to raise himself. He could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fall in and the 
end of Luna's bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him 
with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of 
the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another 
white shape moved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger 
to her lips. 

The door downstairs crashed open. "Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?" said 

a rough voice. "Didn't I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?" 

There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius. "No... no... upstairs... Potter!" 

"I told you last week Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some solid

��303ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid 
bleeding headdress? And the week before" -Another bang, another squeal -"When you thought 
we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are "Cumple" -bang -"Headed" �C bang "
Snorkacks?" 

"No - no - I beg of you!" sobbed Xenophilius. "It really is Potter, Really!" 

"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!" roared the Death Eater, 
and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius. 

"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn," said a cool second voice, echoing up the 
mangled staircase. "The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might bring the place 
down." 

"You lying piece of filth." shouted the wizard named Selwyn. "You have never seen Potter in 
your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you'll get your 
girl back like this?" 

"I swear... I swear... Potter's upstairs!" 

"Homenum revelio." said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he 
had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow. 

"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn," said the second man sharply. 

"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!" sobbed Xenophilius. "Please... please... give me Luna, just let 

me have Luna...�� 

"You can have your little girl, Lovegood," said Selwyn, "if you get up those stairs and bring me 
down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice waiting up there 
to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury." 

Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings. Xenophilius 
was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. 

"Come on," Harry whispered, "we've got to get out of here." He started to dig himself out under 
cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried the deepest. Harry 
and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to 
prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius��s banging and scraping drew nearer 
and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. 

"All right." breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs begin

��304ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to tremble. Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. "Do you trust me, 

Harry?" 

Harry nodded. 

"Okay then." Hermione whispered. "give me the invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to put it 

on." 

"Me? But Harry -" 

"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron grab my shoulder." 

Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking the 

stairs was vibrating. Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know 

what Hermione was waiting for. 

"Hold tight" she whispered. "Hold tight... any second...�� 

Xenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. "Obliviate!" cried 
Hermione, pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath them. "Deprimo!" She had 
blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders. Harry still holding onto her hand 
for dear life, there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way 
as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. 
Hermione twisted in midair and thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she 
dragged him once more into darkness.

Chapter Twenty-Two 
The Deathly Hallows 



Harry fell, panting, onto grass and 

scrambled up 
at once. They seemed to have landed in the 

corner of a 
field at dusk; Hermione was already 

running in a 
circle around them, waving her wand. 
��Protego Totalum... Salvio Hexia...�� 
��That treacherous old bleeder.�� Ron 

panted, 
emerging from beneath the Invisibility 

Cloak and 
throwing it to Harry. ��Hermione you��re a genius, a total 
genius. I can��t believe we got out of that.�� 

��Cave Inimicum... Didn��t I say it was an Erumpent horn, didn��t I tell him? And now his house 
has been blown apart!�� 

��Serves him right,�� said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs, ��What��d you 
reckon they��ll do to him?�� 

��Oh I hope they don��t kill him!�� groaned Hermione, ��That��s why I wanted the Death Eaters to 
get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn��t been lying!��

 ��Why hide me though?�� asked Ron. 

��You��re supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt, Ron! They��ve kidnapped Luna because her 

father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew you��re with him?��

 ��But what about your mum and dad?��

 ��They��re in Australia,�� said Hermione, ��They should be all right. They don��t know anything.�� 

��You��re a genius,�� Ron repeated, looking awed. 

��Yeah, you are, Hermione,�� agreed Harry fervently. ��I don��t know what we��d do without you.�� 

She beamed, but became solemn at once. ��What about Luna?�� 

��Well, if they��re telling the truth and she��s still alive -�� began Ron. 

��Don��t say that, don��t say it!�� squealed Hermione. ��She must be alive, she must!�� 

��Then she��ll be in Azkaban, I expect,�� said Ron. ��Whether she survives the place, though... 
Loads don��t...��

��306ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��She will,�� said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. ��She��s tough, Luna, 
much tougher than you��d think. She��s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and 
Nargles.�� 

��I hope you��re right,�� said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. ��I��d feel so sorry for 

Xenophilius if -�� 

��-if he hadn��t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,�� said Ron. 

They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their narrow 

escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home, safe, familiar, and friendly. 

��Oh, why did we go there?�� groaned Hermione after a few minutes�� silence. ��Harry, you were 
right, it was Godric��s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows... 
such rubbish... although actually,�� a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, ��he might have 
made it all up, mightn��t he? He probably doesn��t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just 
wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!�� 

��I don��t think so,�� said Ron. ��It��s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you��re under stress 
than you��d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to 
be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was 
under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he 
thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.�� 

��Well, I don��t suppose it matters,�� sighed Hermione. ��Even if he was being honest, I never 

heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.�� 

��Hang on, though,�� said Ron. ��The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn��t it?�� 

��But the Deathly Hallows can��t exist, Ron!�� 

��You keep saying that, but one of them can,�� said Ron. ��Harry��s Invisibility Cloak -�� 

��The Tale of the Three Brothers is a story,�� said Hermione firmly. ��A story about how humans 
are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we��d 
have everything we need already!�� 

��I don��t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,�� said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand 
he so disliked over in his fingers. 

��There��s no such thing, Harry!�� 

��You said there have been loads of wands - the Deathstick and whatever they were called -��

��307ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand��s real, what about the Resurrection 
Stone?�� Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. ��No 
magic can raise the dead, and that��s that!�� 

��When my wand connected with You-Know-Who��s, it made my mum and dad appear... and 
Cedric...�� 

��But they weren��t really back from the dead, were they?�� said Hermione. ��Those kind of -of 
pale imitations aren��t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.�� 

��But she, the girl in the tale, didn��t really come back, did she? The story says that once people 
are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, 
didn��t he? He even lived with her for a while...�� 

He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione��s expression. Then, as she 
glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear. He had scared her with his talk of living with dead 
people. 

��So that Peverell bloke who��s buried in Godric��s Hollow,�� he said hastily, trying to sound 
robustly sane, ��you don��t know anything about him, then?�� 

��No,�� she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. ��I looked him up after I saw the 
mark on his grave; if he��d been anyone famous or done anything important, I��m sure he��d be in 
one of our books. The only place I��ve managed to find the name 'Peverell' is Nature��s Nobility, A 
Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,�� she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. ��It 
lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were 
one of the earliest families to vanish.�� 

��Extinct in the male line?�� repeated Ron. 

��It means the name died out,�� said Hermione, ��centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They 
could still have descendents, though, they��d just be called something different.�� 

And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the 
name ��Peverell��, a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he 
cried aloud, ��Marvolo Gaunt!�� 

��Sorry?�� said Ron and Hermione together. 

��Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who��s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo 
Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!��

Ron and Hermione looked bewildered. 

��The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms 
on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry��s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!�� 

��The Peverell coat of arms?�� said Hermione sharply. ��Could you see what it looked like?�� 

��Not really,�� said Harry, trying to remember. ��There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I 

could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked 

open.�� 

Harry saw Hermione��s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. 

Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished. ��Blimey... You reckon it was this sign 

again? The sign of the Hallows? 

��Why not?�� said Harry excitedly, ��Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, 
all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he 
might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he 
wasn��t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He��d have loved to think the scratches on the stone 
were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically 
royal.�� 

��Yes... and that��s all very interesting,�� said Hermione cautiously, ��but Harry, if you��re thinking 
what I think you��re think -�� 

��Well, why not? Why not?�� said Harry, abandoning caution. ��It was a stone, wasn��t it?�� He 
looked at Ron for support. ��What if it was the Resurrection Stone?�� 

Ron��s mouth fell open. 

��Blimey - but would it still work if Dumbledore broke -?�� 

��Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There��s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!�� 

Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. ��Harry you��re trying to fit everything 
into the Hallows story -�� 

��Fit everything in?�� he repeated. ��Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the 
Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!�� 

��A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!�� 

��Where��d you reckon the ring is now?�� Ron asked Harry. ��What did Dumbledore do with it 

after he broke it open?��

��309ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

But Harry��s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione��s... 

Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death... Master... 
Conqueror... Vanquisher... The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death... 

And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose Horcruxes were no 
match... Neither can live while the other survives... Was this the answer? Hallows versus 
Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the 
master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? 

��Harry?�� 

But he scarcely heard Hermione. He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it 
through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in 
his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had 
described, A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures 
eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it... 

And then, with a gasp, he remembered. ��Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!�� 

His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. 

��My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine 
it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric��s Hollow...�� 

Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were 
opening all around him. ��He��s my ancestor. I��m descended from the third brother! It all makes 
sense!�� 

He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them 
was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two. 

��Harry,�� said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers 
shaking hard. 

��Read it,�� he told her, pushing his mother��s letter into her hand. ��Read it! Dumbledore had the 
Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn��t need a Cloak, he could perform a 
Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!�� 

Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair, He had dislodged the Snitch 
when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of 
fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he

��310ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

shouted out. 

��IT��S IN HERE! He left me the ring �C it��s in the Snitch!�� 

��You - you reckon?�� 

He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear to Harry. 
Everything fit, everything... His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open 
the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the 
Elder Wand, and then... 

But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage. All his excitement, all his hope and happiness 
were extinguished at a strokeһ���� , and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell 
was broken. 

��That��s what he��s after.�� 

The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. 

��You-Know-Who��s after the Elder Wand.�� 

He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made 
sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand 
indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked 
out into the night, thinking... 

Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him The Tales of 
Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards 
believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them? 

Harry gazed into the darkness... If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he 
would have sought them, done anything to possess them, three objects that made the possessor 
master of Death. If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes 
in the first place. Didn��t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, 
demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret? 

Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power, without 
understanding that it was one of three... for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden, 
whose existence was best known... The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the 
pages of Wizarding history... 

Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white

��311ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. 

He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he 
had left them, Hermione still holding Lily��s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn��t 
they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes? 

��This is it?�� Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty, 
��This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I��ve got one - maybe two -�� 

He held up the Snitch. ��-and You-Know-Who��s chasing the third, but he doesn��t realize... he 
just thinks it��s a powerful wand -�� 

��Harry,�� said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily��s letter, ��I��m sorry, 
but I think you��ve got this wrong, all wrong.�� 

��But don��t you see? It all fits -�� 

��Not, it doesn��t,�� she said. ��It doesn��t. Harry, you��re just getting carried away. Please,�� she said 
as he started to speak, ��please just answer me this. If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and 
Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of 
Death - Harry, why wouldn��t he have told you? Why?�� 

He had his answer ready. ��But you said it, Hermione! You��ve got to find out about them for 
yourself! It��s a Quest!�� 

��But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods'!�� cried Hermione in 
exasperation. ��I didn��t really believe it!�� 

Harry took no notice. ��Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my 
strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he��d do.�� 

��Harry, this isn��t a game, this isn��t practice! This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very 
clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn��t mean anything, forget the 
Deathly Hallows, we can��t afford to get sidetracked -�� 

Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half 
expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was 
right, that the Deathly Hallows were real. 

She appealed to Ron. ��You don��t believe in this, do you?�� 

Harry looked up, Ron hesitated.

��312ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I dunno... I mean... bits of it sort of fit together,�� said Ron awkwardly, ��But when you look at 
the whole thing...�� He took a deep breath. ��I think we��re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. 
That��s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe... maybe we should forget about this Hallows 
business.�� 

��Thank you, Ron,�� said Hermione. ��I��ll take first watch.�� 

And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a fierce full 
stop. 

But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, 
and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind, the wand, the stone, and 
the Cloak, if he could just possess them all... 

I open at the close... But what was the close? Why couldn��t he have the stone now? If only he 
had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person... and Harry murmured words to 
the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not 
open... 

And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? 
Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort��s thoughts, because for the first time 
ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing... Hermione would not like 
that idea, of course... But then, she did not believe. Xenophilius had been right, in a way... Limited, 
Narrow, Close-minded. The truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, 
especially of the Resurrection Stone... and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, 
nearly swallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield... 

It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by 
dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish 
contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but dementors in those numbers 
would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not tried casting a Patronus 
with the blackthorn wand... He must try that in the morning... 

If only there was a way of getting a better wand... 

And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed him once 
more... 

They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The

��313ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through 
the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think 
only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not 
Hermione��s flat disbelief nor Ron��s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the 
longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and 
Hermione. Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his 
spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry��s belief in and 
longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their 
obsession with the Horcruxes. 

��Obsession?�� said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the 
word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more 
Horcruxes. ��We��re not the one with an obsession, Harry! We��re the ones trying to do what 
Dumbledore wanted us to do!�� 

But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for 
Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone 
hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other survives... master of Death... Why 
didn��t Ron and Hermione understand? 

��The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,���� Harry quoted calmly. 

��I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?�� Hermione retorted, and 
Harry gave up on her. 

Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less 
important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him 
was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the 
other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The 
visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting 
as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct 
features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow 
than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was 
worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that

��314ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these 
unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand��s 
fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort��s mind as well as before. 

As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-absorption, 
that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having 
walked out on (desert, abandon) them, perhaps because Harry��s descent into listlessness 
galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the 
other two into action. 

��Three Horcruxes left,�� he kept saying. ��We need a plan of action, come on! Where haven��t we 
looked? Let��s go through it again. The orphanage...�� 

Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they 
knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered. Ron and Hermione raked over 
them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to 
sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort��s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, 
but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep 
them moving. 

��You never know,�� was Ron��s constant refrain. ��Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he 
might��ve wanted to live there. Let��s go and have a poke around.�� 

These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of 
Snatchers. 

��Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,�� said Ron. ��The lot that got me were 
a bit pathetic, but Bill reckons some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch �C�� 

��On what?�� said Harry. 

��Potterwatch, didn��t I tell you that��s what it was called? The program I keep trying to get on the 
radio, the only one that tells the truth about what��s going on! Nearly all of the programs are 
following You-Know-Who��s line, all except Potterwatch, I really want you to hear it, but it��s 
tricky tuning in...�� 

Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the 
wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat 
dragonpox, and once a few bars of ��A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love.�� While he taped, Ron

��315ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

continued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random words under his 
breath. 

��They��re normally something to do with the Order,�� he told them. ��Bill had a real knack for 
guessing them. I��m bound to get one in the end...�� 

But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard 
duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly 
ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. 

��I��ve got it, I��ve got it! Password was 'Albus'! Get in here, Harry.�� 

Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried 
back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. 
Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting 
open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing. 

��... apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a number of house 

calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.�� 

��But that��s Lee Jordan!�� said Hermione. 

��I know!�� beamed Ron. ��Cool, eh?�� 

��... now found ourselves another secure location,�� Lee was saying, and I��m pleased to tell you 

that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!�� 

��Hi.�� 

��Evening, River.�� 

����River���� that��s Lee,�� Ron explained. ��They��ve all got code names, but you can usually tell -�� 

��Shh!�� said Hermione. 

��But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,�� Lee went on, ��let��s take a moment to report 
those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don��t think important 
enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks 
and Dirk Cresswell.�� 

Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one another in horror. 

��A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas 
and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may 
have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents

��316ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and sisters are desperate for news. 

��Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle 
authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix 
inform me that it was the Killing Curse -more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that 
Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime. 

��Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been 
discovered in Godric��s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the 
Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic. 

��Listeners, I��d like to invite you now to join us in a minute��s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, 
Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles 
murdered by the Death Eaters.�� 

Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, 
half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to 
the outside world for a long time. 

��Thank you,�� said Lee��s voice. ��And now we can return to regular contributor Royal, for an 

update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.�� 

��Thanks, River,�� said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured���ȵ�, reassuring. 

��Kingsley!�� burst out Ron. 

��We know!�� said Hermione, hushing him. 

��Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy 
casualties,�� said Kingsley. ��However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and 
witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the 
Muggles' knowledge. I��d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulateЧ�� 
their example, perhaps 
by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved 
if such simple measures are taken.�� 

��And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it 
should be ��Wizards first��?�� asked Lee. 

��I��d say that it��s one short step from ��Wizards first�� to ��Purebloods first,�� and then to ��Death 
Eaters,���� replied Kingsley. ��We��re all human, aren��t we? Every human life is worth the same, and 
worth saving.��

��317ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Excellently put, Royal, and you��ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this 
mess,�� said Lee. ��And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature (in a newspaper) regular 
column) 'Pals of Potter'.�� 

��Thanks, River,�� said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but Hermione 
forestalled him in a whisper. 

��We know it��s Lupin!�� 

��Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you��ve appeared on our program, that Harry 
Potter is still alive?�� 

��I do,�� said Lupin firmly. ��There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be 
proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a 
deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. 'The Boy Who Lived' remains a 
symbol of everything for which we are fighting, the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the 
need to keep resisting.�� 

A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the 

terrible things he had said when they had last met? 

��And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?�� 

��I��d tell him we��re all with him in spirit,�� said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, ��And I��d tell him 

to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.�� 

Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. 

��Nearly always right,�� she repeated. 

��Oh, didn��t I tell you?�� said Ron in surprise. ��Bill told me Lupin��s living with Tonks again! And 
apparently she��s getting pretty big too...�� 

��... and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter��s who are suffering for their 
allegiance?�� Lee was saying. 

��Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter 
have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,�� 
said Lupin. 

 ��At least he��s still alive!�� muttered Ron. 

��We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid�� �C all three of them gasped, 
and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence -��well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has

��318ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a 
'Support Harry Potter' party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we 
believe, on the run.�� 

��I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you��ve got a sixteen-foot-high half 
brother?�� asked Lee. 

��It would tend to give you an edge,�� agreed Lupin gravely. ��May I just add that while we here 
at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid��s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry��s 
supporters against following Hagrid��s lead. 'Support Harry Potter' parties are unwise in the present 
climate.�� 

��Indeed they are, Romulus,�� said Lee, ��so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion 
to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now let��s move to news 
concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the 
Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about 
him, I��d like to introduce a new correspondent. Rodent?��

 ����Rodent��?�� said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried out together,

 ��Fred!��

 ��No �C is it George?��

 ��It��s Fred, I think,�� said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, 

 ��I��m not being ��Rodent��, no way, I told you I wanted to be ��Rapier���ɶ�ϸ���Ľ���!�� 

��Oh, all right then, Rapier, could you please give us your take on the various stories we��ve been 
hearing about the Chief Death Eater?�� 

��Yes, River, I can,�� said Fred. ��As our listeners will know, unless they��ve taken refuge at the 
bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who��s strategy of remaining in the 
shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are 
genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.�� 

��Which suits him, of course,�� said Kingsley. ��The air of mystery is creating more terror than 
actually showing himself.�� 

��Agreed,�� said Fred. ��So, people, let��s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without 
inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill people with a 
single glance from his eyes. That��s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test, check whether the thing

��319ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

that��s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it��s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is YouKnow-
Who, that��s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.�� 

For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing. He could feel the weight of tension 
leaving him.

 ��And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?�� asked Lee. 

��Well, who wouldn��t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he��s been putting in?�� 
asked Fred. ��Point is, people, don��t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he��s out of the 
country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn��t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape 
confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don��t count on him being a long way away if 
you��re planning to take any risks. I never thought I��d hear myself say it, but safety first!�� 

��Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,�� said Lee. ��Listeners, that brings us to the 
end of another Potterwatch. We don��t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you 
can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials. The next password will be ��Mad-Eye��. 
Keep each other safe, Keep faith. Good night.�� 

The radio��s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry 
had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting 
Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep.

 ��Good, eh?�� said Ron happily.

 ��Brilliant,�� said Harry.

 ��It��s so brave of them,�� sighed Hermione admiringly. ��If they were found ...��

 ��Well, they keep on the move, don��t they?�� said Ron. ��Like us.�� 

��But did you hear what Fred said?�� asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his 
thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. ��He��s abroad! He��s still looking for 

the Wand, I knew it!��

 ��Harry����

 ��Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol �C��

tent. ��I told you, Harry, I told you, we can��t say it anymore �C we��ve got to put the protection back

But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and 
begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer, rough, excited voices. Ron pulled 
the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it. Their lamps went out.

 ��Come out of there with your hands up!�� came a rasping voice through the darkness. ��We know 
you��re in there! You��ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don��t care who we curse!��

Chapter Twenty-Three 
Malfoy Manor 


Harry looked around at the other two, now 
in the darkness. He saw Hermione point her 
toward the outside, but into his face; there was a 
of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable 
could feel his face swelling rapidly under his 
heavy footfalls surrounded him. 

"Get up, vermin." Unknown hands dragged 
roughly off the ground, before he could stop 


mere outlines 
wand, not 
bang, a burst 
to see. He 
hands as 

Harry 
them, 

someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry clutched at 
his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and 
puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits 
through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent, all he 
could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside 
too. 

"Get - off - her!" Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh, Ron 
grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, "No! Leave him alone, leave him alone!" 

"Your boyfriend's going to have worse than that done to him if he's on my list," said the 
horribly familiar, rasping voice. "Delicious girl... what a treat ... I do enjoy the softness of the 
skin." 

Harry's stomach turned over. He knew who this was, Fenrit Greyback, the werewolf who was 

permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery.

 "Search the tent!" said another voice. 

Harry was thrown face down onto the ground. A thud told him that Ron had been cast down 
beside him. They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the 
tent as they searched. 

"Now, let's see who we've got," said Greyback's gloating voice from overhead, and Harry was 
rolled over onto his back. A beam of wand light fell onto his face and Greyback laughed.

"I'll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you, ugly?"

 Harry did not answer immediately. 

"I said," repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double 
over in pain. "what happened to you?"

 "Stung." Harry muttered. "Been Stung." 

 "Yeah, looks like it." said a second voice.

 "What��s your name?" snarled Greyback.

 "Dudley." said Harry.

 "And your first name?" 

 "I - Vernon. Vernon Dudley." 

"Check the list, Scabior." said Greyback, and Harry head him move sideways to look down at 

Ron, instead. "And what about you, ginger?" 

 "Stan Shunpike." said Ron. 

"Like 'ell you are." said the man called Scabior. "We know Stan Shunpike, 'e's put a bit of work 

our way."

 There was another thud.

 "I'b Bardy," said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. "Bardy Weasley." 

"A Weasley?" rasped Greyback. "So you're related to blood traitors even if you're not a 

Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little friend ...�� The relish in his voice made Harry's flesh crawl.

 "Easy, Greyback." said Scabior over the jeering of the others.

 "Oh, I'm not going to bite just yet. We'll see if she��s a bit quicker at remembering her name than 

Barny. Who are you, girly?

 "Penelope Clearwater." said Hermione. She sounded terrified, but convincing.

 "What's your blood status?" 

 "Half-Blood." said Hermione. 

"Easy enough to check," said Scabior. "But the 'ole lot of 'em look like they could still be 

'ogwarts age -" 

 "We'b lebt," said Ron. 

"Left, 'ave you, ginger?" said Scabior. "And you decided to go camping? And you thought, just 

for a laugh, you'd use the Dark Lords name?" 

��323ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Nod a laugh," said Ron. "Aggiden." 

 "Accident?" There was more jeering laughter. 

"You know who used to like using the Dark Lord's name, Weasley?" growled Greyback, "The 
Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?"

 "Doh." 

"Well, they don't show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name's been Tabooed. A few Order 

members have been tracked that way. We'll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!" 

 Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed him down into a sitting 
position, then started binding him back-to-back with other people. Harry was still half blind, barely 
able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When at last the man tying them had walked 
away, Harry whispered to the other prisoners. 

 "Anyone still got a wand?" 

 "No." said Ron and Hermione from either side of him.

 "This is all my fault. I said the name. I'm sorry -" 

 "Harry?" 

It was a new, but familiar voice. And it came from directly behind Harry, from the person tied 
to Hermione's left.

 "Dean?" 
"It is you! If they find out who they've got! They're Snatchers, they're only looking for truants��
����to sell for gold -" 

"Not a bad little haul for one night." Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed boots (boot 
with nails placed in the sole for protection) marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes 
from inside the tent. "A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and these truants. You checked their names 
on the list yet, Scabior?" he roared.

 "Yeah. There's no Vernon Dudley on 'ere, Greyback."

 "Interesting," said Greyback. "That's interesting." 

He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infinitesimal gap left between his 
swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers, with pointed brown teeth and 
sores in the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where 
Dumbledore had died, of dirt, sweat, and blood.

"So you aren't wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different name? What 

house were you in at Hogwarts?" 

 "Slytherin," said Harry automatically. 

"Funny 'ow they all thinks we wants to 'ear that." leered Scabior out of the shadows. "But none 
of 'em can tell us where the common room is." 

"It's in the dungeons." said Harry clearly. "You enter through the wall. It's full of skulls and 
stuff and it��s under the lake, so the light's all green,"

 There was a short pause. 

"Well, well, looks like we really 'ave caught a little Slytherin." said Scabior. "Good for you, 

Vernon, 'cause there ain't a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who's your father?" 

"He works at the Ministry," Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would collapse with the 
smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual 
appearance before the game was up in any case. "Department of Magical Accidents and 
Catastrophes."

 "You know what, Greyback," said Scabior. "I think there is a Dudley in there." 

 Harry could barely breathe. Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this? 

"Well, well." said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous 
voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had just indeed just attacked and bound 
the son of a Ministry Official. Harry's heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he 
would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it. 

"If you're telling the truth, ugly, you've got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect 

your father'll reward us just for picking you up." 

 "But," said Harry, his mouth bone dry, "if you just let us -" 

 "Hey!" came a shout from inside the tent. "Look at this. Greyback!" 

A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver to the light of their 
wands. They had found Gryffindor's sword. 

"Ve-e-ery nice," said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion. "Oh, very nice 
indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?" 

"It's my father's," Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for Greyback to see the 
name etched just below the hilt. "We borrowed it to cut firewood -" 

��325ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"'ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!" 

As Scabior said it, Harry's scar, which was stretched tight across his distended forehead, burned 
savagely. More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a 
grim fortress, jet-black and forbidding, Voldemort's thoughts had suddenly become Razor-Sharp 
again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose ... 

So close ... So close ... 

With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort's thoughts, pulling himself back 
to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook in the darkness, listening to Greyback 
and Scabior. 

"'Hermione Granger," Scabior was saying, "the Mudblood who is known to be traveling with 
'arry Potter." 

Harry's scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present, nor to 
slip into Voldemort's mind. He heard the creak of Greyback's boots as he crouched down, in front 
of Hermione.

 "You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you."

 "It isn't! It isn't me!"

 Hermione's terrified squeak was as good as a confession. 

"... known to be traveling with Harry Potter," repeated Greyback quietly.

 A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry's scar was exquisitely painful, but he struggled with 
all his strength against the pull of Voldemort's thoughts. It had never been so important to remain 
in his own right mind. 

"Well, this changed things, doesn't it?" whispered Greyback. Nobody spoke. Harry sensed the 
gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione's arm trembling against his. Greyback got 
up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching down again to stare closely at his 
misshapen features. 

"What's that on your forehead, Vernon?" he asked softly, his breath foul in Harry's nostrils as 
he pressed a filthy finger to the taught scar. 

"Don't touch it!�� Harry yelled; he could not stop himself, he thought he might be sick from the 
pain of it.

 "I thought you wore glasses, Potter?" breathed Greyback.

��326ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I found glasses!" yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background. "There was glasses 
in the tent, Greyback, wait -" 

And seconds later Harry's glasses had been rammed back onto his face. The Snatchers were 
closing in now, peering at him.

 "It is!" rasped Greyback. "We've caught Potter!" 

They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. Harry, still fighting to 
remain present in his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say. Fragmented visions were 
breaking across the surface of his mind - 

-He was hiding around the high walls of the black fortress - 

 No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger - 

-looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower - 

 He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices - 

 -Time to fly ... 

 "... To the Ministry?" 

"To hell with the Ministry." growled Greyback. "They'll take the credit, and we won't get a look 
in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who." 

 "Will you summon 'im? 'ere?" said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified. 

"No," snarled Greyback, "I haven't got -they say he's using the Malfoy's place as a base. We'll 

take the boy there." 

Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort. The werewolf might be 
allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort's inner circle 
were branded with the Dark Mark, Greyback had not been granted this highest honor. 

Harry��s scar seared again �C 

�C and he rose into the night, flying straight up to the windows at the very top of the tower �C 

��... completely sure it��s him? 'Cause if it ain��t, Greyback, we��re dead.�� 

��Who��s in charge here?�� roared Greyback, covering his moment of inadequacy. ��I say that��s 
Potter, and him plus his wand, that��s two hundred thousand Galleons right there! But if you��re too 
gutless to come along, any of you, it��s all for me, and with any luck, I��ll get the girl thrown in (add 
in something for free, give something free of charge)!�� 

�C The window was the merest slit in the black rock, not big enough for a man to enter... A

skeletal figure was just visible through it, curled beneath a blanket. Dead, or sleeping ... ? 

��All right!�� said Scabior. ��All right, we��re in! And what about the rest of 'em, Greyback, what��ll 
we do with 'em?�� 

��Might as well take the lot. We��ve got two Mudbloods, that��s another ten Galleons. Give me the 
sword as well. If they��re rubies, that��s another small fortune right there.�� 

The prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Hermione��s breathing, fast and 
terrified. 

��Grab hold and make it tight. I��ll do Potter!�� said Greyback, seizing a fistful of Harry��s hair; 
Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. ��On three! One �C two �C three �C�� 

They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry struggled, trying to throw off 
Greyback��s hand, but it was hopeless, Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on 
either side; he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of him his 
scar seared more painfully still �C 

�C as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor 
inside the cell-like room �C 
The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. Harry��s eyes, still 
puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what 
looked like a long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had not happened 
yet, Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew, for he was fighting to resist the vision, in some 
strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. How long it would take Voldemort to get to this 
place, once he knew that Harry was here, was another matter.

 One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them.

 ��How do we get in? They��re locked, Greyback, I can��t �C blimey!�� 

He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting, twisting itself out of the abstract 
furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing voice. ��State your 

purpose!��

 ��We��ve got Potter!�� Greyback roared triumphantly. ��We��ve captured Harry Potter!��

 The gates swung open. 

��Come on!�� said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up 

the drive, between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above

��328ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by 
Greyback; now he was staggering along sideways, tied back-to-back (one right after another, in 
immediate succession) to the four other prisoner. Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his 
scar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he 
knew yet that Harry was caught.. 

The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, eyes opening 
in a skull of a face. The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon him, upon Voldemort, and 
then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. 

��So, you have come. I thought you would ... one day. But your journey was pointless. I never 
had it.��

 ��You lie!�� 

As Voldemort��s anger throbbed inside him, Harry��s scar threatened to burst with pain, and he 
wrenched his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed 
over gravel. 

 Light spilled out over all of them.

 ��What is this?�� said a woman��s cold voice.

 ��We��re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!�� rasped Greyback.

 ��Who are you?�� 

��You know me!�� There was resentment in the werewolf��s voice. ��Fenrit Greyback! We��ve 
caught Harry Potter!�� 

Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other prisoners to 
shuffle around too. 

��I know 'e��s swollen, ma'am, but it��s 'im!�� piped up Scabior. ��If you look a bit closer, you��ll see 
'is scar. And this 'ere, see the girl? The Mudblood who��s been traveling around with 'im, ma'am. 
There��s no doubt it��s 'im, and we��ve got 'is wand as well! 'Ere, ma��am �C�� 

Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face. Scabior 

thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows.

 ��Bring them in,�� she said. 

Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with 

portraits.

��329ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Follow me,�� said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. ��My son, Draco, is home for his 
Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.�� 

The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost closed Harry 
could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more 
portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble 
fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers.

 ��What is this?�� 

The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry��s ears. He was 
panicking now. He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out 
Voldemort��s thoughts, though his scar was still burning. 

��They say they��ve got Potter,�� said Narcissa��s cold voice. ��Draco, come here.�� Harry did not 
dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely; a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from 
an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.

 Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath the chandelier.

 ��Well, boy?�� rasped the werewolf. 

Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled����
����װ�� frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since 
leaving Grimmauld Place. 

His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione��s jinx. His black hair 
reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was 
he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses. He resolved not to 
speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the 
latter approached. 

��Well, Draco?�� said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. 

��Is it? Is it Harry Potter?�� 

��I can��t �C I can��t be sure,�� said Draco. He was keeping his distance from Greyback, and seemed 
as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him.

 ��But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!��

 Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.

 ��Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv �C��

��330ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Now, we won��t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope Mr. Malfoy?�� said Greyback 
menacingly. 

��Of course not, of course not!�� said Lucius impatiently. He approached Harry himself, came so 
close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen 
eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of 
a cage. 

 ��What did you do to him?�� Lucius asked Greyback. ��How did he get into this state?��

 ��That wasn��t us.�� 

��Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,�� said Lucius.

 His gray eyes raked Harry��s forehead. 

��There��s something there,�� he whispered. ��it could be the scar, stretched tight... Draco, come 
here, look properly! What do you think?�� 

Harry saw Draco��s face up close now, right beside his father��s. They were extraordinarily alike, 
except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, Draco��s expression was full of 
reluctance, even fear. 

��I don��t know,�� he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood 
watching. 

��We had better be certain, Lucius,�� Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, clear voice. 
��Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord ... They say this is his...�� �C she 
was looking closely at the blackthorn wand �C ��but it does not resemble Ollivander��s description... 
If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing ... Remember what he did to Rowle 
and Dolohov?�� 

��What about the Mudblood, then?�� growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown off his feet as 
the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light fell on Hermione 
instead. 

��Wait,�� said Narcissa sharply. ��Yes �C yes, she was in Madam Malkin��s with Potter! I saw her 

picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isn��t it the Granger girl?��

 ��I ... maybe ... yeah.�� 

��But then, that��s the Weasley boy!�� shouted Lucius, striding around the bound prisoners to face 

Ron. ��It��s them, Potter��s friends �C Draco, look at him, isn��t it Arthur Weasley��s son, what��s his

��331ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

name �C?��

 ��Yeah,�� said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. ��It could be.�� 

The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the sound of the voice 

wound Harry��s fear to an even higher pitch.

 ��What is this? What��s happened, Cissy?�� 

Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry��s right, staring at 

Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes,

 ��But surely,�� she said quietly, ��this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?�� 

��Yes, yes, it��s Granger!�� cried Lucius, ��And beside her, we think, Potter! Potter and his friends, 

caught at last!�� 

��Potter?�� shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry. ��Are you sure? 
Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!�� She dragged back her left sleeve, Harry saw 
the Dark Mark burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to 
summon her beloved master. 

��I was about to call him!�� said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon Bellatrix��s wrist, 
preventing her from touching the Mark. ��I shall summon him, Bella. Potter has been brought to my 
house, and it is therefore upon my authority �C�� 

��Your authority!�� she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. ��You lost your 

authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!��

 ��This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy �C�� 

��Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,�� interjected Greyback, ��but it��s us that caught Potter, and 

it��s us that��ll be claiming the gold �C�� 

��Gold!�� laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her brother-in-law, her free hand 
groping in her pocket for her wand. ��Take your gold, filthy scavenger, what do I want with gold? I 
seek only the honor of his �C of �C�� 

She stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something Harry could not see. Jubilant at her 

capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve �C 

 ��STOP!�� shrieked Bellatrix, ��Do not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now!�� 

Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix strode out of Harry��s 

limited line of vision. 

��332ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��What is that?�� he heard her say.

 ��Sword,�� grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher.

 ��Give it to me.��

 ��It��s not yours, missus, it��s mine, I reckon I found it.�� 

There was a bang and a flash of red light; Harry knew that the Snatcher had been Stunned. 
There was a roar of anger from his fellows, Scabior drew his wand. 

 ��What d��you think you��re playing at, woman?��

 ��Stupefy!�� she screamed, ��Stupefy!�� 

They were no match for her, even thought there were four of them against one of her, she was a 
witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience. They fell where they stood, all 
except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms outstretched. Out of the 
corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor 
gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen. 

��Where did you get this sword?�� she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his 
unresisting grip. 

��How dare you?�� he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze 
up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. ��Release me, woman!�� 

��Where did you find this sword?�� she repeated, brandishing it in his face, ��Snape sent it to my 
vault in Gringotts!��

 ��It was in their tent,�� rasped Greyback. ��Release me, I say!�� 

She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary to approach 
her. He prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved nails clutching its back. 

��Draco, move this scum outside,�� said Bellatrix, indicating the unconscious men. ��If you 
haven��t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.��

 ��Don��t you dare speak to Draco like �C�� said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix screamed. 

��Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious 
problem!�� 

She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. Then she turned to 
look at the silent prisoners. 

��If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,�� she muttered, more to herself than to the others.

��333ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself... But if he finds out ... I must ... I must 
know... ��

 She turned back to her sister again. 

��The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do!�� 

��This is my house, Bella, you don��t give orders in my �C�� 

��Do it! You have no idea of the danger we��re in!�� shrieked Bellatrix. She looked frightening, 

mad; a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet. 

Narcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf. 

��Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.�� 

��Wait,�� said Bellatrix sharply. ��All except... except for the Mudblood.�� 

Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure. 

��No!�� shouted Ron. ��You can have me, keep me!�� 

Bellatrix hit him across the face, the blow echoed around the room. 

��If she dies under questioning, I��ll take you next,�� she said. ��Blood traitor is next to Mudblood 
in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more 
to them �C yet.�� 

She threw Greyback��s wand back to him, then took a short silver knife from under her robes. 
She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the 
room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door, into a dark 
passageway, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force. 

��Reckon she��ll let me have a bit of the girl when she��s finished with her?�� Greyback crooned as 
he forced them along the corridor. ��I��d say I��ll get a bite or two, wouldn��t you, ginger?�� 

Harry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep flight of stairs, still tied back-toback 
and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. At the bottom was a heavy 
door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room 
and left them in total darkness. The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away 
before there was a terrible, drawn out scream from directly above them. 

��HERMIONE!�� Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying 
them together, so that Harry staggered. ��HERMIONE!�� 

��Be quiet!�� Harry said. ��Shut up. Ron, we need to work out a way �C��

��HERMIONE! HERMIONE!�� 

��We need a plan, stop yelling �C we need to get these ropes off �C�� 

��Harry?�� came a whisper through the darkness. ��Ron? Is that you?�� 

Ron stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry saw a shadow 
moving closer. 

��Harry? Ron?�� 

��Luna?�� 

��Yes, it��s me! Oh no, I didn��t want you to be caught!�� 

��Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?�� said Harry. 

��Oh yes, I expect so. There��s an old nail we use if we need to break anything... Just a 
moment ...�� 

Hermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear Bellatrix screaming too, but her 
words were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, ��HERMIONE! HERMIONE!�� 

��Mr. Ollivander?�� Harry could hear Luna saying. ��Mr. Ollivander, have you got the nail? If you 
just move over a little bit ... I think it was beside the water jug.�� 

She was back within seconds. 

��You��ll need to stay still,�� she said. 

Harry could feel her digging at the rope��s tough fibers to work the knots free. From upstairs they 

heard Bellatrix��s voice. 

��I��m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where?�� 

��We found it �C we found it �C PLEASE!�� Hermione screamed again; Ron struggled harder than 

ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry��s wrist. 

��Ron, please stay still!�� Luna whispered. ��I can��t see what I��m doing �C�� 

��My pocket!�� said Ron, ��In my pocket, there��s a Deluminator, and it��s full of light!�� 

A few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the Deluminator had sucked 
from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar. Unable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung 
there, like tiny suns, flooding the underground room with light. Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her 
white face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the 
corner. Craning around, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners, Dean and Griphook the goblin, 
who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans.

��335ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Oh, that��s much easier, thanks, Ron,�� said Luna, and she began hacking at their bindings again. 

��Hello, Dean!�� 

From above came Bellatrix��s voice. 

��You��re lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell 

the truth, tell the truth!�� 

Another terrible scream. 

��HERMIONE!�� 

��What else did you take? What else have you got? Tel me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you 

through with this knife!�� 

��There!�� 

Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running around the 
cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor. Dean, his face bruised and bloody, 
said ��Thanks�� to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank onto the cellar floor, looking 
groggy and disoriented, many welts across his swarthy face. 

Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand. 

��There��s no way out, Ron,�� said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. ��The cellar is completely 
escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he��s tried everything.�� 

Hermione was screaming again. The sound went through Harry like physical pain. Barely 
conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the 
walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless. 

��What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!�� 

Hermione��s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the 
walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrid��s pouch from around his neck and 
groped inside it. He pulled out Dumbledore��s Snitch and shook it, hoping for he did not know what 

�C nothing happened �C he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they were lifeless �C the 
mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of brightest blue �C 
Dumbledore��s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. 
��Help us!�� he yelled at it in mad desperation. ��We��re in the cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us!�� 
The eye blinked and was gone. 
Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard of mirror this way and

��336ҳ��

that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs 
Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was bellowing, ��HERMIONE! 
HERMIONE!�� 

��How did you get into my vault?�� they heard Bellatrix scream. ��Did that dirty little goblin in the 
cellar help you?�� 

��We only met him tonight!�� Hermione sobbed. ��We��ve never been inside your vault... It isn��t 
the real sword! It��s a copy, just a copy!�� 

��A copy?�� screeched Bellatrix. ��Oh, a likely story!�� 

��But we can find out easily!�� came Lucius��s voice. ��Draco, fetch the goblin, he can tell us 

whether the sword is real or not!�� 

Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor. 

��Griphook,�� he whispered into the goblin��s pointed ear, ��you must tell them that sword��s a fake, 
they mustn��t know it��s the real one, Griphook, please �C�� 

He could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps; next moment, Draco��s shaking voice 
spoke from behind the door. 

��Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don��t try anything, or I��ll kill you!�� 

They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Deluminator and the lights 
whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar��s darkness. The door flew open; Malfoy marched 
inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He seized the little goblin by the arm 
and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut and at the same 
moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar. 

Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket, 

revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst. 

��DOB �C !�� 

Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified at his mistake. 
Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead, Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix. 

Dobby��s enormous, tennis-ball shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his feet to the 
tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petrified. 

��Harry Potter,�� he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, ��Dobby has come to rescue you.�� 

��But how did you �C?��

��337ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

An awful scream drowned Harry��s words, Hermione was being tortured again. He cut to the 

essentials. 

��You can Disapparate out of this cellar?�� he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears flapping. 

��And you can take humans with you?�� 

Dobby nodded again. 

��Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander, and take them �C take them 

to �C�� 

��Bill and Fleur��s,�� said Ron. ��Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth!�� 

The elf nodded for a third time. 

��And then come back,�� said Harry. ��Can you do that, Dobby?�� 

��Of course, Harry Potter,�� whispered the little elf. He hurried over to Mr. Ollivander, who 

appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the wandmaker��s hands in his own, then held out 

the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved. 

��Harry, we want to help you!�� Luna whispered. 

��We can��t leave you here,�� said Dean. 

��Go, both of you! We��ll see you at Bill and Fleur��s.�� 

As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds he looked down, not 

upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully. 

��Kill me, then. Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will not bring you what you seek. 
There is so much you do not understand...�� 

He felt Voldemort��s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out, returning to the cellar 

and the horror of his own present. 

��Go!�� Harry beseeched to Luna and Dean. ��Go! We��ll follow, just go!�� 

They caught hold of the elf��s outstretched fingers. There was another loud crack, and Dobby, 
Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished. 

��What was that?�� shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. ��Did you hear that? What was 
that noise in the cellar?�� 

Harry and Ron stared at each other. 

��Draco �C no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!�� 

Footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry knew that the people in the

��338ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar. 

��We��re going to have to try and tackle him,�� he whispered to Ron. They had no choice. The 
moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. ��Leave 
the lights on,�� Harry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they 
backed against the wall on either side of it. 

��Stand back,�� came Wormtail��s voice. ��Stand away from the door. I��m coming in.�� The door 
flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light 
from the three miniature suns floating in midair. Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon 
him. Ron seized Wormtail��s wand arm and forced it upwards. Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, 
muffling his voice. Silently they struggled, Wormtail��s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed 
around Harry��s throat. 

��What is it, Wormtail?�� called Lucius Malfoy from above. 

��Nothing!�� Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail��s wheezy voice. ��All fine!�� 

Harry could barely breathe. 

��You��re going to kill me?�� Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. ��After I 
saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!�� 

The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it. He wrenched himself free, astonished, 
keeping his hand over Wormtail��s mouth. He saw the rat-like man��s small watery eyes widen with 
fear and surprise. He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, 
merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo 
that moment of weakness. 

��And we��ll have that,�� whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail��s wand from his other hand. 

Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew��s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid from Harry��s face to 
something else. His own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat. 

��No �C�� 

Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. The 
silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and 
useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was 
being strangled before their eyes. 

��No!��

��339ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the crushing metal 
fingers from around Wormtail��s throat, but it was no use. Pettigrew was turning blue. 

��Relashio!�� said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew 
dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. 
Wormtail��s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and was still. 

Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail��s body on the floor behind them, ran 
up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room. Cautiously they 
crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, which was ajar. Now they had a clear 
view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who was holding Gryffindor��s sword in his long-
fingered hands. Hermione was lying at Bellatrix��s feet. She was barely stirring. 

��Well?�� Bellatrix said to Griphook. ��Is it the true sword?�� 

Harry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar. 

��No,�� said Griphook. ��It is a fake.�� 

��Are you sure?�� panted Bellatrix. ��Quite sure?�� 

��Yes,�� said the goblin. 

Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it. 

��Good,�� she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the 
goblin��s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him aside. ��And now,�� she said in 

a voice that burst with triumph, ��we call the Dark Lord!�� 

And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark Mark. 

At once, Harry��s scar felt as though it had split open again. His true surroundings vanished, He 
was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was 
enraged at the summons he felt �C he had warned them, he had told them to summon him for 
nothing less than Potter. If they were mistaken ... 

��Kill me, then!�� demanded the old man. ��You will not win, you cannot win! That wand will 
never, ever be yours �C�� 

And Voldemort��s fury broke. A burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body 
was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort returned to the window, his 
wrath barely controllable. They would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling 
him back.

��340ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��And I think,�� said Bellatrix��s voice, ��we can dispose of the Mudblood. Greyback, take her if 

you want her.�� 

��NOOOOOOOOOOOO!�� 

Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around, shocked; she turned her wand to 

face Ron instead �C 

��Expelliarmus!�� he roared, pointing Wormtail��s wand at Bellatrix, and hers flew into the air and 
was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, Draco and Greyback wheeled 
about; Harry yelled, ��Stupefy!�� and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto the hearth. Jets of light flew 
from Draco��s, Narcissa��s, and Greyback��s wands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind 
a sofa to avoid them. 

��STOP OR SHE DIES! 

Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was supporting Hermione, who 
seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to Hermione��s throat. 

��Drop your wands,�� she whispered. ��Drop them, or we��ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!�� 

Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtail��s wand. Harry straightened up, still holding Bellatrix��s. 

��I said, drop them!�� she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione��s throat, Harry saw beads 
of blood appear there. 

��All right!�� he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix��s wand onto the floor at his feet, Ron did the 
same with Wormtail��s. Both raised their hands to shoulder height. 

��Good!�� she leered. ��Draco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter! Your death 
approaches!�� 

Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel Voldemort flying 
through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to 
Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out. 

��Now,�� said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands. ��Cissy, I think we 
ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure 
the Dark Lord will not begrudge��ϧ 
you the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.�� 

At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them looked upward in 
time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to 
fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw herself aside with a scream.

��341ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of 
Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal 
flew in all directions; Draco doubled over, his hands covering his bloody face. 

As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance, He leapt over an 
armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco��s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and 
yelled, ��Stupefy!�� The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and 
then smashed to the ground. 

As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her feet, her hair 

flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway. 

��Dobby!�� she screamed and even Bellatrix froze. ��You! You dropped the chandelier �C?�� 

The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. 

��You must not hurt Harry Potter,�� he squeaked. 

��Kill him, Cissy!�� shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and Narcissa��s wand too 
flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. 

��You dirty little monkey!�� bawled Bellatrix. ��How dare you take a witch��s wand, how dare you 
defy your masters?�� 

��Dobby has no master!�� squealed the elf. ��Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save 
Harry Potter and his friends!�� 

Harry��s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had moments, seconds before 
Voldemort was with them. 

��Ron, catch �C and GO!�� he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent down to tug 
Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the 
sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby��s hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate. 

As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale, frozen 
figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron��s hair, and a blue of flying silver, 
as Bellatrix��s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing. 

Bill and Fleur��s ... Shell Cottage ... Bill and Fleur��s ... 

He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the destination 
and hope that it would suffice to take him there. The pain in his forehead pierced him, and the 
weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of Gryffindor��s sword bumping

��342ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

against his back, Dobby��s hand jerked in his; he wondered whether the elf was trying to take 
charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers, to indicate that that 
was fine with them. 

And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees, relinquished Dobby��s 

hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground. 

��Are you all right?�� he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. 

Harry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short way away 
under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it. 

��Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?�� he whispered, clutching the two wands he had brought from the 
Malfoys��, ready to fight if he needed to. ��Have we come to the right place? Dobby?�� 

He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. 

��DOBBY!�� 

The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and Harry looked 
down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf��s heaving chest. 

��Dobby �C no �C HELP!�� Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. 
��HELP!�� 

He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared 
about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby��s front, and that he had stretched out his 
own arms to Harry with a look of supplication (earnest request). Harry caught him and laid him 
sideways on the cool grass. 

��Dobby, no, don��t die, don��t die �C�� 

The elf��s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. 

��Harry ... Potter ...�� 

And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than 
great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.

Chapter Twenty-Four 
The Wandmaker 


It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for 


an instant 
Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore��s body at 

the foot of 
the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he 

was staring at 
a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by 

Bellatrix��s 
silver knife. Harry��s voice was still saying, 

��Dobby... 
Dobby...�� even though he knew that the elf had 

gone where 
he could not call him back. 

After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were 
Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. ��Hermione,�� he said 
suddenly. ��Where is she?�� 

��Ron��s taken her inside,�� said Bill. ��She��ll be all right.�� Harry looked back down at Dobby. He 
stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf��s body, then dragged off his own 
jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket. 

The sea was rushing against the rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it while the others 
talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the 
injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making sugegstions 
about bury the elf. Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he 
gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed 
as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left 
behind at the Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry��s grief for Dobby seemed to 
diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean. 

��I want to do it properly,�� were the first words of which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. 
��Not by magic. Have you got a spade?�� And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging 
the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug 
with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of 
his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives. 

His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned

��344ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him 
to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was 
consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned 
Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out... though Dumbledore, of course, would have said 
that it was love. 

On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming (include,��...�������� 
) 
his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his 
own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys�� 
returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the 
darkness... 

The steady rhythm of his arms beat time������ with his thoughts. Hallows... Horcruxes... 
Hallows... Horcruxes... yet no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had 
snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been slapped awake again. 

Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, 
and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why... 

And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy... 
Dumbledore had foreseen that... How much more had he known? 

Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he 
was rejoined by Ron and Dean. ��How��s Hermione?�� 

��Better,�� said Ron. ��Fleur��s looking after her.�� 

Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect 
grave with his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with 
spades of their own and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. 

Harry wrapped the elf more snuggly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped 
off his shoes and socks, which he placed on the elf��s bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which 
Harry placed carefully upon Dobby��s head, muffling his batlike ears. ��We should close his eyes.��

 Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, 
Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to 
be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; 
Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur��s coats,

��345ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf��s eyelids, sliding them over his 
glassy stare. ��There,�� she said softly. ��Now he could be sleeping.�� 

Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, 
then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break 
down as he remembered Dumbledore��s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the 
Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore��s achievements, the stateliness of 
the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay 
between bushes in a roughly dug hole. ��I think we ought to say something,�� piped up Luna. ��I��ll 
go first, shall I?�� 

And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. ��Thank 
you so much Dobby for rescuing me from that cellar. It��s so unfair that you had to die when you 
were so good and brave. I��ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you��re happy now.�� 

She turned and looked expectingly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, 

��yeah... thanks Dobby.�� 

��Thanks,�� muttered Dean. 

Harry swallowed. ��Good bye Dobby,�� he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it 
all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell 
neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. 

��D��ya mind if I stay here a moment?�� He asked the others. 

They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all 
traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. 

He looked around. There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking 
the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place 
where Dobby��s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He 
had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to 
remember wrenching them out of someone��s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt 
friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. 

Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock��s surface. He knew 
that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark 
the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read, HERE

LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. 

He looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar still prickling a 
little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken 
shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. 

They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused 
upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood 
burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in 
the doorway, listening. 

��... lucky that Ginny��s on holiday. If she��d been at Hogwarts they could have taken her before 
we reached her. Now we know she��s safe too.�� He looked around and saw Harry standing there. 
��I��ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,�� he explained. ��Moved them to Muriel��s. The Death 
Eaters know Ron��s with you now, they��re bound to target the family �C don��t apologize,�� he added 
at the sight of Harry��s expression. ��It was always a matter of time, Dad��s been saying so for 
months. We��re the biggest blood traitor family there is.�� 

��How are they protected?�� asked Harry. 

��Fidelius Charm. Dad��s Secret-Keeper. And we��ve done it on this cottage too; I��m Secret-
Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that��s hardly the most important thing now. Once 
Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we��ll move them to Muriel��s too. There isn��t much 
room here, but she��s got plenty. Griphook��s legs are on the mend. Fleur��s given him Skele-Gro, we 
could probably move them in an hour or -�� 

��No,�� Harry said and Bill looked startled. ��I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It��s 
important.�� He heard the authority of his own voice, the conviction, the voice of purpose that had 
come to him as he dug Dobby��s grave. All of their faces were turned toward him looking puzzled. 

��I��m going to wash,�� Harry told Bill looking down at his hands still covered with mud and 
Dobby��s blood. ��Then I��ll need to see them, straight away.�� He walked into the little kitchen, to 
the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink 
and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to him in the 
dark garden... 

Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he 
had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come.

Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it. 

Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the 
murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this 
dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all. 

And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too. Harry understood 
and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling him one thing, his brain quite another. The 
Dumbledore in Harry��s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers, pressed together 
as if in prayer. 

You gave Ron the Deluminator... You understood him... You gave him a way back... 

And you understood Wormtail too... You knew there was a bit of regret there, somewhere... 

And if you knew them... What did you know about me, Dumbledore? 

Am I meant to know but not to seek? Did you know how hard I��d feel that? Is that why you made 
it this difficult? So I��d have time to work that out? 

Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold ray of dazzling sun 
was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily 
surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned to the hall, and as he 
did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and then flashed across his mind, swift as the reflection of a 
dragonfly over water, the outline of a building he knew extremely well.

 Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs. 

 ��I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,�� Harry said.

 ��No,�� said Fleur. ��You will 'ave to wait, 'Arry. Zey are both too tired �C�� 

��I��m sorry,�� he said without heat, ��but it can��t wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately �C and 
separately. It��s urgent.�� 

��Harry, what the hell��s going on?�� asked Bill. ��You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a 
half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she��s been tortured, and Ron��s just refused to tell 
me anything �C�� 

��We can��t tell you what we��re doing,�� said Harry flatly. ��You��re in the Order, Bill, you know 
Dumbledore left us a mission. We��re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.�� 

Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at Harry. His deeply 
scarred face was hard to read. Finally, Bill said, ��All right. Who do you want to talk to first?��

��348ҳ��

Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time left; now was 

the moment to decide, Horcruxes or Hallows.

 ��Griphook,�� Harry said. ��I��ll speak to Griphook first.��

 His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle.

 ��Up here, then,�� said Bill, leading the way.

 Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back. 

��I need you two as well!�� he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking��� 
, half 
concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room.

 They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved. 

��How are you?�� Harry asked Hermione. ��You were amazing �C coming up with that story when 

she was hurting you like that �C��

 Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed squeeze.

 ��What are we doing now, Harry?�� he asked. 

 ��You��ll see. Come on.�� 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. Three doors 

led off it. 

��In here,�� said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur��s room, it too had a view of the sea, 
now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the 
spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the chair beside 
the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm. 

Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully upon the bed. Griphook 

grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all.

 ��I��m sorry to take you out of bed,�� said Harry. ��How are your legs?��

 ��Painful,�� replied the goblin. ��But mending.�� 

He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look, half truculent (cruel; 
harsh), half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin��s sallow skin, his long thin fingers, his black eyes. 
Fleur had removed his shoes, His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but not by 
much. His domed head was much bigger than a human��s.

 ��You probably don��t remember �C�� Harry began. 

��-that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you ever visited

��349ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Gringotts?�� said Griphook. ��I remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very 
famous.�� 

Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up���� 
. Harry��s scar was still 
prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time 
was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his 
request, the goblin broke the silence. 

��You buried the elf,�� he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous (bitter, resentful). ��I watched 

you from the window of the bedroom next door.��

 ��Yes,�� said Harry.

 Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes.

 ��You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.��

 ��In what way?�� asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently.

 ��You dug the grave.��

 ��So?�� 

Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a 
Muggle, but it did not matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby��s grave or not. He 
gathered himself for the attack. ��Griphook, I need to ask �C��

 ��You also rescued a goblin.��

 ��What?��

 ��You brought me here. Saved me.��

 ��Well, I take it you��re not sorry?�� said Harry a little impatiently. 

��No, Harry Potter,�� said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his 
chin, ��but you are a very odd wizard.��

 ��Right,�� said Harry. ��Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.�� 

The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as though he had 

never seen anything like him.

 ��I need to break into a Gringotts vault.��

 Harry had not meant to say it so badly, the words were forced from him as pain shot through his 
lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to 
deal with Griphook first.

��350ҳ��

Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad.

 ��Harry �C�� said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. 

��Break into a Gringotts vault?�� repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted his position 
upon the bed. ��It is impossible.��

 ��No, it isn��t,�� Ron contradicted him. ��It��s been done.��

 ��Yeah,�� said Harry. ��The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.�� 

��The vault in question was empty at the time,�� snapped the goblin, and Harry understood that 
even though Griphook had left Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defenses being 
breached. ��Its protection was minimal.�� 

��Well, the vault we need to get into isn��t empty, and I��m guessing its protection will be pretty 
powerful,�� said Harry. ��It belongs to the Lestranges.�� 

He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to 
explain after Griphook had given his answer. 

��You have no chance,�� said Griphook flatly. ��No chance at all. If you seek beneath our floors, 
a treasure that was never yours �C�� 

��Thief, you have been warned, beware �C yeah, I know, I remember,�� said Harry. ��But I��m not 
trying to get myself any treasure, I��m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you 
believe that?�� 

The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry��s forehead prickled, but 
he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation. 

��If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain,�� said 
Griphook finally, ��it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection 
or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.�� 

��Wand-carriers,�� repeated Harry, The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled, as 
Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door. 

��The right to carry a wand,�� said the goblin quietly, ��has long been contested between wizards 
and goblins.��

 ��Well, goblins can do magic without wands,�� said Ron. 

 ��That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, 

they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!��

��351ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Well, goblins won��t share any of their magic either,�� said Ron. ��You won��t tell us how to 
make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have 
never �C�� 

��It doesn��t matter,�� said Harry, noting Griphook��s rising color. ��This isn��t about wizards versus 

goblins or any other sort of magical creature �C��

 Griphook gave a nasty laugh. 

��But it is, it is precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, your race is set 
still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, 
and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?�� 

��We do!�� said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. ��We protest! And I��m hunted 
quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I��m a Mudblood!��

 ��Don��t call yourself �C�� Ron muttered. 

��Why shouldn��t I?�� said Hermione. ��Mudblood, and proud of it! I��ve got no higher position 
under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the 
Malfoys!�� 

As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had 
made, scarlet against her throat. 

��Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?�� she asked. ��Did you know that we��ve 
wanted elves to be freed for years?�� (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione��s chair.) 
��You can��t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!��

 The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiousity he had shown Harry.

 ��What do you seek within the Lestranges�� vault?�� he asked abruptly. ��The sword that lies inside 
it is a fake. This is the real one.�� He looked from one to the other of them. ��I think that you already 
know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.�� 

��But the fake sword isn��t the only thing in that vault, is it?�� asked Harry. ��Perhaps you��ve seen 
other things in there?�� 

His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his 
scar. 

 The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. 

��It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous

��352ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our 
fingers.�� 

The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione to Ron and 
then back again.

 ��So young,�� he said finally, ��to be fighting so many.�� 

��Will you help us?�� said Harry. ��We haven��t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin��s help. 

You��re our one chance.��

 ��I shall ... think about it,�� said Griphook maddeningly.

 ��But �C�� Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. 

 ��Thank you,�� said Harry.

 The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his short legs. 

��I think,�� he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur��s bed, ��that the Skele-Gro 

has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me.�� 

��Yeah, of course,�� said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the 
sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw 
resentment in the goblin��s eyes as he closed the door upon him.

 ��Little git,�� whispered Ron. ��He��s enjoying keeping us hanging.�� 

��Harry,�� whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the 
still-dark landing, ��are you saying what I think you��re saying? Are you saying there��s a Horcrux in 
the Lestranges vault?�� 

��Yes,�� said Harry. ��Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we��d been in there, she was beside 
herself. Why? What did she think we��d seen, what else did she think we might have taken? 
Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.�� 

��But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who��s been, places he��s done something 
important?�� said Ron, looking baffled. ��Was he ever inside the Lestranges�� vault?�� 

��I don��t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,�� said Harry. ��He never had gold there 
when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the 
outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.�� 

Harry��s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to understand about 
Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander.

��353ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think he��d have 
seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don��t forget, he trusted Bellatrix 
and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for 
him after he vanished. He said it the night he came back, I heard him.��

 Harry rubbed his scar. 

��I don��t think he��d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy 
the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place 
it in her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me... except 
for Hogwarts.��

 When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head. 

 ��You really understand him.�� 

��Bits of him,�� said Harry. ��Bits ... I just wish I��d understood Dumbledore as much. But we��ll 
see. Come on �C Ollivander now.�� 

Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but very impressed as they followed him across the little 
landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur��s. A weak ��Come in!�� answered them. 

The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been held in the 
cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, 
the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed 
vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a 
skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not 
visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and the freshly dug grave. 

 ��Mr. Ollivander, I��m sorry to disturb you,�� Harry said. 

��My dear boy,�� Ollivander��s voice was feeble. ��You rescued us, I thought we would die in that 
place, I can never thank you ... never thank you ... enough.��

 ��We were glad to do it.�� 

Harry��s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to 
beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic ... yet he had 
made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. Feigning a calm he did not feel, he 
groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand. 

 ��Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.��

��354ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Anything. Anything.�� Said the wandmaker weakly.

 ��Can you mend this? Is it possible?�� 

Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected halves in his 
palm. 

��Holly and phoenix feather,�� said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. ��Eleven inches. Nice and 

supple.��

 ��Yes,�� said Harry. ��Can you -?�� 

��No,�� whispered Ollivander. ��I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered this degree of 

damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.�� 

Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took the wand halves back 
and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered 
wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he 
had brought from the Malfoys��.

 ��Can you identify these?�� Harry asked. 

 The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between 
his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly. 

��Walnut and dragon heartstring,�� he said. ��Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This 
wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.��

 ��And this one?��

 Ollivander performed the same examination. 

��Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of 

Draco Malfoy.��

 ��Was?�� repeated Harry. ��Isn��t it still his?��

 ��Perhaps not. If you took it �C��

 ��- I did �C�� 

��-then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also depends upon the 
wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.��

 There was a silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea. 

��You talk about wands like they��ve got feelings,�� said Harry, ��like they can think for 
themselves.��

��355ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��The wand chooses the wizard,�� said Ollivander. ��That much has always been clear to those of 

us who have studied wandlore.��

 ��A person can still use a wand that hasn��t chosen them, though?�� asked Harry. 

��Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any 
instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity 
between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual 
quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.�� 

The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound. ��I took this wand from Draco 
Malfoy by force,�� said Harry. ��Can I use it safely?�� 

��I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its 
will to its new master.�� 

��So I should use this one?�� said Ron, pulling Wormtail��s wand out of his pocket and handing it 
to Ollivander. 

��Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this 
shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your 
bidding, and do it well, than another wand.��

 ��And this holds true for all wands, does it?�� asked Harry. 

��I think so,�� replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry��s face. ��You ask deep 
questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.�� 

��So, it isn��t necessary to kill the previous owner to take the possession of a wand?�� asked 
Harry.

 Ollivander swallowed.

 ��Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.�� 

��There are legends, though,�� said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar 
became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort has decided to put his idea into action. ��Legends 
about a wand �C or wands �C that have been passed from hand to hand by murder.�� 

Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes were 
enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. 

 ��Only one wand, I think,�� he whispered. 

 ��And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn��t he?�� asked Harry.

��356ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I �C how?�� croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help. ��How 

do you know this?��

 ��He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,�� said Harry.

 Ollivander looked terrified. 

��He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I �C I had no choice but to tell 
him what I knew, what I guessed!�� 

��I understand,�� said Harry. ��You told him about the twin cores? You said he just had to borrow 
another wizard��s wand?��

 Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He nodded slowly. 

��But it didn��t work,�� Harry went on. ��Mine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you know why 

that is?��

 Ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded. 

��I had ... never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique that night. The 
connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand would have snapped the 
borrowed wand, I do not know...�� 

��We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. When YouKnow-
Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and asked about that 
other wand, didn��t he?�� 

��How do you know this?��

 Harry did not answer. 

��Yes, he asked,�� whispered Ollivander. ��He wanted to know everything I could tell him about 
the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.��

 Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted. 

��The Dark Lord,�� said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, ��had always been happy with 
the wand I made him �C yew and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches �C until he discovered 
the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more powerful wand, as the only way to 
conquer yours.�� 

��But he��ll know soon, if he doesn��t already, that mine��s broken beyond repair,�� said Harry 
quietly.

 ��No!�� said Hermione, sounding frightened. ��He can��t know that, Harry, how could he -?��

��357ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Priori Incantatem,�� said Harry. ��We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys��, 
Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells they��ve cast lately, 
they��d see that yours broke mine, they��ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they��ll realize 
that I��ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.�� 

The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron gave Harry a 

reproachful look, and said, ��Let��s not worry about that now -�� 

But Mr. Ollivander intervened. 

��The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is 

determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.��

 ��And will it?�� 

��The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,�� said Ollivander, ��but the idea of the 

Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit ... formidable.�� 

Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when they first met, of how much he 
liked Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the 
Dark Wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him.

 ��You �C you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?�� asked Hermione. 

��Oh yes,�� said Ollivander. ��Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand��s course through 
history. There are gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or 
hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned 
in wandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other 
wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity.��

 ��So you �C you don��t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?�� Hermione asked hopefully. 

��No,�� said Ollivander. ��Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its history is 
bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such 
passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of 
incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.�� 

��Mr. Ollivander,�� said Harry, ��you told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder 
Wand, didn��t you?�� 

Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. ��But how �C how do 
you - ?��

��358ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Never mind how I know it,�� said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and 
he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so 
much farther north. ��You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand?�� 

��It was a rumor,�� whispered Ollivander. ��A rumor, years and years ago long before you were 
born, I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it would be for business; 
that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!�� 

��Yes, I can see that,�� said Harry. He stood up. ��Mr. Ollivander, one last thing, and then we��ll 

let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?��

 ��The �C the what?�� asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered.

 ��The Deathly Hallows.��

 ��I��m afraid I don��t know what you��re talking about. Is this still something to do with wands?�� 

Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He did not know 

about the Hallows. 

 ��Thank you,�� said Harry. ��Thank you very much. We��ll leave you to get some rest now.�� 

Ollivander looked stricken. ��He was torturing me!�� he gasped. ��The Cruciatus Curse ... you 

have no idea ...��

 ��I do,�� said Harry, ��I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this.�� 

He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught glimpses of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and 
Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry as 
he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, Ron and 
Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry 
walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully. It was a huge effort now 
to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have 
to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory 
was right. He must make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and 
Hermione. 

��Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,�� he said, ��I saw You-Know-Who trying to 
find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn��t have it anymore. It was 
stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don��t 
know �C but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can��t have been that

difficult.�� 

Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts. Harry could see him standing there, and see too the 
lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer. 

��And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of his power, 
when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat 
him, and he took the Elder Wand.��

 ��Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?�� said Ron. ��But then �C where is it now?�� 

��At Hogwarts,�� said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden.

 ��But then, let��s go!�� said Ron urgently. ��Harry, let��s go and get it before he does!�� 

��It��s too late for that,�� said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched his head, trying to 
help it resist. ��He knows where it is. He��s there now.�� 

��Harry!�� Ron said furiously. ��How long have you known this �C why have we been wasting 
time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone �C we could still go �C�� 

��No,�� said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. ��Hermione��s right. Dumbledore didn��t 
want me to have it. He didn��t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.��

 ��The unbeatable wand, Harry!�� moaned Ron. 

 ��I��m not supposed to ... I��m supposed to get the Horcruxes... �� 

And now everything was cool and dark. The sun was barely visible over the horizon as he 

glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake.

 ��I shall join you in the castle shortly,�� he said in his high, cold voice. ��Leave me now.�� 

Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry walked 
slowly, waiting for Snape��s figure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, 
to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal 
himself ... and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even 
from his own eyes. 

And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the beloved castle, his 
first kingdom, his birthright ... 

And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white marble tomb, an 
unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that 
heady sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand. How fitting that this would be

��360ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

its last great act. 

The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long as thin as it had been in 
life. He raised the wand again. 

The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent (��͸����), pale, sunken, yet almost 
perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose, He felt amused derision. 
Dumbledore��s hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, buried 
with him. 

Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? Had he thought that 
the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the 
wand from Dumbledore��s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of sparks flew from its tip, sparkling 
over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last.

Chapter Twenty-Five 
Shell Cottage 


Bill and Fleur's cottage stood alone on a cliff 


overlooking 
the sea, its walls embedded with shells and 

whitewashed. 
It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry 

went inside the 
tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant 

ebb and flow 
of the sea, like the breathing of some great, 

slumbering 
creature. He spent much of the next few days 

making 
excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, 
and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. 

The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He could not 
remember, ever before, choosing not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help 
voicing whenever they were together. 

"What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?" 

"What if working out what the symbol meant made you 'worthy' to get the Hallows?" 

"Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-
Who?" 

Harry had no answers. There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright 
madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain 
satisfactorily why he had decided against it. Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal 
arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to him. 

The odd thing was that Hermione's support made him feel just as confused as Ron's doubts. 

Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, 
and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered. 

"You could never have done that, Harry," she said again and again. "You couldn't have broken 
into Dumbledore's grave." 

But the idea of Dumbledore's corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he 
might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore's intentions. He felt that he was still groping in 
the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the

��362ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore 
crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the 
cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died. 

"But is he dead?" said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had been 
staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione 
had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument. 

"Yes, he is. Ron, please don't start that again!" 

"Look at the facts, Hermione," said Ron, speaking across Harry, who continued to gaze at the 
horizon. "The silver doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror -" 

"Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don't you, Harry?" 

"I could have," said Harry without looking at her. 

"But you don't think you did, do you?" asked Ron. 

"No, I don't," said Harry. 

"There you go!" said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. "If it wasn't Dumbledore, 
explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?" 

"I can't -but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he's lying in a tomb at 
Hogwarts?" 

"I dunno, it could've been his ghost!" 

"Dumbledore wouldn't come back as a ghost," said Harry. There was little about Dumbledore he 
was sure of now, but he knew that much. "He would have gone on." 

"What d'you mean, 'gone on'?" asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice behind 
them said, "'Arry?" 

Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze. 

"'Arry, Grip'ook would like to speak to you. 'E eez in ze smallest bedroom, 'e says 'e does not 
want to be over'eard." 

Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable as she 
walked back around the house. 

Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage's three bedrooms, 
in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the 
bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage.

"I have reached my decision, Harry Potter," said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a 
low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. "Though the goblins of Gringotts will 
consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you -" 

"That's great!" said Harry, relief surging through him. "Griphook, thank you, we're really -" 

"- in return," said the goblin firmly, "for payment." 

Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. "How much do you want? I've got gold." 

"Not gold," said Griphook. "I have gold." 

His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. 

"I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor." 

Harry's spirits plummeted. "You can't have that," he said. "I'm sorry." 

"Then," said the goblin softly, "we have a problem." 

"We can give you something else," said Ron eagerly. "I'll bet the Lestranges have got loads of 
stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault." 

He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily. 

"I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!" 

"The sword's ours -" 

"It is not," said the goblin. 

"We're Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor's -" 

"And before it was Gryffindor's, whose was it?" demanded the goblin, sitting up straight. 

"No one's," said Ron. "It was made for him, wasn't it?" 

"No!" cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. "Wizarding 
arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First's, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a 
lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the goblins. The sword is the price of 
my hire, take it or leave it!" 

Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then said, "We need to discuss this, 

Griphook, if that's all right. Could you give us a few minutes?" 

The goblin nodded, looking sour. 

Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to 
think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, "He's having a laugh. We can't let him have that sword." 

"It is true?" Harry asked Hermione. "Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?"

��364ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I don't know," she said hopelessly. "Wizarding history often skates over (go over quickly) what 
the wizards have done to other magical races, but there's no account that I know of that says 
Gryffindor stole the sword." 

"It'll be one of those goblin stories," said Ron, "about how the wizards are always trying to get 
one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn't asked for one of our 
wands." 

"Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron." said Hermione. "They've been treated 
brutally in the past." 

"Goblins aren't exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?" said Ron. "They've killed plenty 
of us. They've fought dirty too." 

"But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded���ӵ� and violent isn't 
going to make him more likely to help us, is it?" 

There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked out of 
the window at Dobby's grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone. 

"Okay," said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, "how's this? We tell Griphook we need 
the sword until we get inside the vault and then he can have it. There's a fake in these, isn't there? 
We switch them, and give him the fake." 

"Ron, he'd know the difference better than we would!" said Hermione. "He's the only one who 
realized there had been a swap!" 

"Yeah, but we could scarper (British Slang)��� 
escape without paying a debt) before he 
realizes -" 

He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him. 

"That," she said quietly, "is despicable. Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you 
wonder why goblins don't like wizards, Ron?" 

Ron's ears had turned red. "All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What's your 
solution, then?" 

"We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable." 

"Brilliant, I'll go and get one of our ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap�ð�װ
ֽ��װ it." 

Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the

��365ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one 
indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. 

He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that 
Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him. He had always been proud to be a 
Gryffindor. Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who had clashed with 
the pureblood-loving Slytherin. 

"Maybe he's lying," Harry said, opening his eyes again. "Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor didn't 

take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history's right?" 

"Does it make a difference?" asked Hermione. 

"Changes how I feel about it," said Harry. 

He took a deep breath. 

"We'll tell him he can have the sword after he's helped us get into that vault - but we'll be careful 

to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it." 

A grin spread slowly across Ron's face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed. 

"Harry, we can't -" 

"He can have it," Harry went on, "after we've used it on all of the Horcruxes. I'll make sure he 

gets it then. I'll keep my word." 

"But that could be years!" said Hermione. 

"I know that, but he needn't. I won't be lying... really." 

Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remembered the words that had 

been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard, FOR THE GREATER GOOD. He pushed the 

idea away. What choice did they have? 

"I don't like it," said Hermione. 

"Nor do I, much," Harry admitted. 

"Well, I think it's genius," said Ron, standing up again. "Let's go and tell him." 

Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any 
definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; 
he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for 
nobody but Harry. 

"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?"

��366ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Yes," said Harry. 

"Then shake," said the goblin, holding out his hand. 

Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. 
Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, "So. We begin!" 

It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They settled to work in the 
smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook's preference, in semidarkness. 

"I have visited the Lestranges' vault only once," Griphook told them, "on the occasion I was told 
to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding 
families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected." 

They remained shut in the cupboard-like room for hours at a time. Slowly the days stretched 
into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store 
of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted. 

"There's really only enough left for one of us," said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike potion 
against the lamplight. 

"That'll be enough," said Harry, who was examining Griphook's hand-drawn map of the deepest 
passageways. 

The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on 
now that Harry, Ron and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, 
although Harry often felt Bill's eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned. 

The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. 
Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed 
to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges' vault. 
Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it. They 
needed Griphook. 

The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he 
continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following 
an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. 
Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same 
food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi. 

Harry felt responsible. It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell

��367ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven 
into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work. 

"I'm sorry," he told Fleur, one blustery (stormy) April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. 
"I never meant you to have to deal with all of this." 

She had just set some knives to work, chipping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had 
preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced 
behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened. 

"'Arry, you saved my sister's life, I do not forget." 

This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had 
never been in real danger. 

"Anyway," Fleur went on, pointing her want at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to 
bubble at once, "Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel's zis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze 
goblin," she scowled a little at the mention of him, "can move downstairs, and you, Ron, and Dean 
can take zat room." 

"We don't mind sleeping in the living room," said Harry, who knew that Griphook would think 
poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. "Don't 
worry about us." And when she tried to protest he went on, "We'll be off your hands soon too, Ron, 
Hermione, and I. We won't need to be here much longer." 

"But, what do you mean?" she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole dish 
now suspended in midair. "Of course you must not leave, you are safe 'ere!" 

She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door opened at 
that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of 
driftwood. 

"... and tiny little ears," Luna was saying, "a bit like hippo's, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. 
And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast." 

Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the 
combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. Seizing 
the chance to escape Fleur's questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed 
them. 

"... and if you ever come to our house I'll be able to show you the horn. Daddy wrote to me

��368ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

about it but I haven't seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and 
I never got home for Christmas," Luna was saying, as she and Dean relit the fire. 

"Luna, we told you," Hermione called over to her. "That horn exploded. It came from an 
Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack -" 

"No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn," said Luna serenely, "Daddy told me. It will probably 
have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know." 

Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. 
Ollivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill's 
arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase. 

"I'm going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander," said Luna, approaching the old man. 

"And I you, my dear," said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. "You were an inexpressible 
comfort to me in that terrible place." 

"So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander," said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. "And I wonder whezzer 
you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill's Auntie Murie!? I never returned 'er tiara." 

"It will be an honor," said Ollivander with a little bow, "the very least I can do in return for your 
generous hospitality." 

Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara sat 
glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. 

"Moonstones and diamonds," said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry 
noticing. "Made by goblins, I think?" 

"And paid for by wizards," said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive 
and challenging. 

A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander set off into the night. 
The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to 
move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them. Fleur, Harry 
noticed, was merely playing with her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; 
however, Bill returned before they had finished their first course, his long hair tangled by the wind. 

"Everything's fine," he told Fleur. "Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends 
you all her love, Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they're still operating an Owl-
Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she

��369ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

thought we'd stolen it." 

"Ah, she eez charmant, your aunt," said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty 
plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them and marched out of the room. 

"Daddy's made a tiara," piped up Luna, "Well, more of a crown, really." 

Ron caught Harry's eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous 
headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius. 

"Yes, he's trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he's identified most of the 
main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference -" 

There was a bang on the front door. Everyone's head turned toward it. Fleur came running out of 
the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feed, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight. 

"Who is it?" Bill called. 

"It is I, Remus John Lupin!" called a voice over the howling wind. 

Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? 

"I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, 
told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!" 

"Lupin," muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. 

Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling cloak, his graying hair 

windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried 

aloud, "It's a boy! We've named him Ted, after Dora's father!" 

Hermione shrieked. 

"Wha -? Tonks - Tonks has had the baby?" 

"Yes, yes, she's had the baby!" shouted Lupin. 

All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief, Hermione and Fleur both squealed, 

"Congratulations!" and Ron said, "Blimey, a baby!" as if he had never heard of such a thing before. 

"Yes -yes -a boy," said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He strode 
around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never 
have happened. 

"You'll be godfather?" he said as he released Harry. 

"M-me?" stammered Harry.

��370ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"You, yes, of course - Dora quite agrees, no one better -" 

"I - yeah - blimey -" 

Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur 
was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink. 

"I can't stay long, I must get back," said Lupin, beaming around at them all. He looked years 

younger than Harry had ever seen him. "Thank you, thank you, Bill" 

Bill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high in a toast. 

"To Teddy Remus Lupin," said Lupin, "a great wizard in the making (future)!" 

"'Oo does 'e look like?" Fleur inquired. 

"I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black when he 
was born, but I swear it's turned ginger in the hour since. Probably blond by the time I get back. 
Andromeda says Tonks's hair started changing color the day that she was born." He drained his 
goblet. "Oh, go on then, just one more," he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again. 

The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon opening 
another bottle of wine. Lupin's news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them 
for a while from their state of siege. Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed 
untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he 
now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill's 
eyes following the goblin up the stairs. 

"No... no... I really must get back," said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He 
got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself. 

"Good-bye, good-bye -I'll try and bring some pictures in a few day's time -they'll all be so glad 
to know that I've seen you -" 

He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the 
men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night. 

"Godfather, Harry!" said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the table. 
"A real honor! Congratulations!" 

As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the door behind him closed, 
shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin's 
absence.

��371ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn't been easy to get an opportunity with the 

cottage this full of people." 

Bill hesitated. "Harry, you're planning something with Griphook." 

It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, 

waiting. 

"I know goblins," said Bill. "I've worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there 
can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends -or, at least, goblins I know 
well, and like." 

Again, Bill hesitated. "Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised 

him in return?" 

"I can't tell you that," said Harry. "Sorry, Bill." 

The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets. 

"Wait," Bill told her, "Just a moment." 

She backed out and he closed the door again. 

"Then I have to say this," Bill went on. "If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, 
and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin 
notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones." 

Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. "What 
do you mean?" he asked. 

"We are talking about a different breed of being," said Bill. "Dealings between wizards and 
goblins have been fraught for centuries -but you'll know all that from History of Magic. There has 
been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a 
belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards 
cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership." 

"I respect -" Harry began, but Bill shook his head. 

"You don't understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To 
a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin made 
objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs." 

"But it was bought -" 

"-then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, however,

��372ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw 
Griphook's face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the 
fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser 
died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard 
without further payment, little more than theft." 

Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was letting 
on. 

"All I am saying," said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, "is to be 
very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts 
than to renege [r.'n..g]ΥԼ;���� 
on a promise to a goblin." 

"Right," said Harry as Bill opened the door, "yeah. Thanks. I'll bear that in mind." 

As he followed Bill back to the others a wry (ironic) thought came to him, born no doubt of the 
wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin 
as Sirius Black had been to him.

Chapter Twenty-Six 



Gringotts 

Their plans were made, their preparations complete; in 


the smallest 
bedroom a single long, coarse black hair (plucked from 

the sweater 
Hermione had been wearing at Malfoy Manor) lay curled 

in a small 
glass phial on the mantelpiece. 
"And you'll be using her actual wand," said Harry, nodding toward the walnut wand, "so I 

reckon you'll be pretty convincing."

 Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bit her as she picked it up. 

"I hate that thing," she said in a low voice. "I really hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn't work 

properly for me ... It's like a bit of her." 

Harry could not help but remember how Hermione has dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn 
wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling him 
to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however, the eve of their 
attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her.

 "It'll probably help you get in character, though," said Ron. "think what that wand's done!" 

"But that's my point!" said Hermione. "This is the wand that tortured Neville's mum and dad, 
and who knows how many other people? This is the wand that killed Sirius!" 

Harry had not thought of that. He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to 
snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor's sword, which was propped against the wall beside him. 

"I miss my wand," Hermione said miserably. "I wish Mr. Ollivander could have made me 
another one too." 

Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She was out on the back lawn at that 
moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the 
Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily. 

Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been 
surprised, but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione's had done. 
Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands, Harry thought he 
knew what Hermione's problem was. She had not won the walnut wand's allegiance by taking it

��374ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

personally from Bellatrix. 

The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached instinctively for the hilt 
of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at once. He could tell that the goblin 
had noticed. 

Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said, "We've just been checking the last-minute 
stuff, Griphook. We've told Bill and Fleur we're leaving tomorrow, and we've told them not to get 
up to see us off." 

They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to transform in Bellatrix 
before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to 
do, the better. They had also explained that they would not be returning. As they had lost Perkin's 
old tent on the night that the Snatcher's caught them, Bill had lent them another one. It was now 
packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from 
the Snatchers by the simple expedient (Ӧ���취��Ȩ���ֶ�) of stuffing it down her sock. 

Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the home comforts they had 
enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of Shell 
Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard, tired of being shut in the 
tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and 
when they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor's sword remained a 
question to which Harry had no answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going to 
do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than five 
minutes at a time. 

"He could give my mother lessons," growled Ron, as the goblin's long fingers kept appearing 
around the edges of doors. 

With Bill's warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch 
for possible skullduggery. 

Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up 
attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it, Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been 
able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than "We'll just 
have to wing it����ʱ׼��/�ճɣ�, mate." 

Harry slept badly that night. Lying away in the early hours, he thought back to the way he had

��375ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, 
almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts. He could not 
shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was 
good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the 
difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir 
and was sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry 
did not speak. 

It was a relief when six o��clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags, dress in 
the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and 
Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May. Harry looked up at 
the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and 
forward against the cliff. He was going to miss the sound. 

Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby's grave now, in a 
year's time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf's name had 
already acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest 
in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking 
down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. 
His fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, through which 
he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledore's eye. 
Then the sound of a door opening made him look around. 

Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As 
she walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old 
robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really 
Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long black 
hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then 
she spoke, and he heard Hermione through Bellatrix's low voice.

 "She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so I can do you ...��

 "Right, but remember, I don't like the beard too long." 

 "Oh, for heaven's sake, this isn't about looking handsome." 

"It's not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you did

last time." 

Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed various 
aspects of Ron's appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting 
to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be 
concealed under the Invisibility Cloak.

 "There," said Hermione, "how does he look, Harry?" 

It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought, because he knew 
him so well. Ron's hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no 
freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.

 "Well, he's not my type��������ϲ�������ͣ�, but he'll do," said Harry. "Shall we go, then?" 

All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, 
then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius 
Chard stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook 
spoke. 

 "I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?" 

Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked on front of Harry's 
throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength 
with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it 
over them both.

 "Perfect," she said, bending down to check Harry's feet. "I can't see a thing. Let's go." 

Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating with all his might on 
the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter 
as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later Harry's feet found pavement and 
he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions 
of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn's existence. 

The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Tom, the stooped and toothless landlord, 
was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation 
in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the shadows. 

"Madam Lestrange," murmured Tom, and as Hermione paused he inclined his head 
subserviently.

��377ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Good morning," said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback��
��/����under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised. 

"Too polite," Harry whispered in Hermione's ear as they passed out of the Inn into the tiny 
backyard. "You need to treat people like they're scum!"

 "Okay, okay!" 

Hermione drew out Bellatrix's wand and rapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them. 
At once the bricks began to whirl and spin, A hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew 
wider and wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon 
Alley. 

It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any shoppers abroad 
(outside, out of doors). The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place 
Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever 
were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created 
since his last visit. Harry's own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many 
windows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE. 

A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them moaning to the few 
passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that they were really wizards. One man had a bloody 
bandage over his eye. 

As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. They seemed to melt away 
before her, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after 
them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path. 

"My children," he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-pitched, he sounded 

distraught. "Where are my children? What has he done with them? You know, you know!" 

 "I -I really -" stammered Hermione. 

The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat. Then, with a bang and a burst of red light he 
was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched 
and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the 
street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passersby gathered their robes about them and 
broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene. 

Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a moment

��378ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. 

Before they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry from behind them.

 "Why, Madam Lestrange!" 

Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry's neck. A tall, thin wizard 

with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them. 

"It's Travers," hissed the goblin into Harry's ear, but at that moment Harry could not think who 
Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to full height and said with as much contempt as she 
could muster,

 "And what do you want?" 

 Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted. 

"He's another Death Eater!" breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to repeat the 
information into Hermione's ear. 

 "I merely sought to greet you," said Travers coolly, "but if my presence is not welcome ...�� 

Harry recognized his voice now. Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned 
to Xenophilius��s house. 

"No, no, not at all, Travers," said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up her mistake. "How are 
you?"

 "Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix."

 "Really? Why?" asked Hermione. 

"Well," Travers coughed, "I heard that the Inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the 
house, after the ... ah ... escape." 

Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be 
out in public - 

"The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past," said Hermione 
in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix's most contemptuous manner. "Perhaps your credit is not as 
good with him as mine is, Travers." 

Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious. He glanced down at 

the man Ron had just Stunned. 

 "How did it offend you?"

 "It does not matter, it will not do so again," said Hermione coolly.

��379ҳ��

"Some of these wandless can be troublesome," said Travers. "While they do nothing but beg I 
have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case in the Ministry last week. 
'I'm a witch, sir, I'm a witch, let me prove it to you!" he said in a squeaky impersonation. "As if I 
was going to give her my wand -but whose wand," said Travers curiously, "are you using at the 
moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was -" 

"I have my wand here," said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix's wand. "I don't know what 

rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed."

 Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron. 

 "Who is your friend? I do not recognize him." 

"This is Dragomir Despard," said Hermione; they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the 

safest cover for Ron to assume. "He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark 

Lord's aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime."

 "Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?"

 "'Ow you?" said Ron, holding out his hand. 

 Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron's hand as though frightened of dirtying himself. 

��So what brings you and your-ah-sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?" asked 

Travers.

 "I need to visit Gringotts," said Hermione. 

"Alas, I also," said Travers. "Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live without it, yet I confess I 

deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends." 

 Harry felt Griphook's clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck. 

 "Shall we?" said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward. 

Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked, cobbled 
street toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops. 
Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed. 

A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with 
Travers matching at what he believed to be Bellatrix's side, there was no means for Harry to 
communicate with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps 
leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried���Ʒ��� 
goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were

��380ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

clutching long thin golden rods. 

 "Ah, Probity Probes," signed Travers theatrically, "so crude but so effective!" 

And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods 
and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment 
and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds, Harry pointed Draco's wand at 
each of the guards in turn and murmured, "Confundo" twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was 
looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells 
hit them.

 Hermione's long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps. 

 "One moment, madam," said the guard, raising his Probe. 

"But you've just done that!" said Hermione in Bellatrix's commanding, arrogant voice. Travers 
looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe 

and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice,

 "Yeah, you've just checked them, Marius." 

Hermione swept forward. Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them. 

Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold. The wizards were both scratching their heads. 

Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which carried the 
poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a 
knife-sharp memory came to him, standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven, 
the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, "Like I said, yeh'd 
be mad ter try an' rob it." Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted 
repository���� 
;���ش�of a trove (sum of money) of gold he had never known he possessed, and 
never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal ... But within seconds they 
were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank. 

The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the first customers of 
the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold 
coin through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of 
explaining features of the hall to Ron. 

The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, "Leprechaun," 
and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back

��381ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to him.

 Hermione stepped forward. 

"Madam Lestrange!" said the goblin, evidently startled. "Dear me! How -how may I help you 

today?"

 "I wish to enter my vault," said Hermione. 

The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was Travers hanging 

back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione.

 "You have ... identification?" asked the goblin.

 "Identification? I -I have never been asked for identification before!" said Hermione. 

"They know!" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, "They must have been warned there might be 

an imposter!" 

"Your wand will do, madam," said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling hand, and in a 
dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix's 
wand had been stolen.

 "Act now, act now," whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, "the Imperious Curse!" 

Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, 
for the first time in his life, "Imperio!" 

A curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling, warmth that seemed to flow 
from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just 
cast. The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and then said, "Ah, you have had a 
new wand made, Madam Lestrange!"

 "What?" said Hermione, "No, no, that's mine -" 

"A new wand?" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all around were 
watching. "But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?" 

 Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, "Imperio!" once more. 

"Oh yes, I see," said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, "yes, very handsome, and is it 
working well? I always think wands require a little breaking inѵ������ 
, don't you?" 

Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief she accepted the bizarre 
turn of events without comment.

 The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached.

��382ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I shall need the Clankers," he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later 
with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. "Good, 
good! So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange," said the old goblin, hopping down off his 
stool and vanishing from sight. "I shall take you to your vault." 

He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the contents of the 
leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open. 
Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion. 

 ��Wait �C Bogrod!��

 Another goblin came scurrying around the counter. 

��We have instructions,�� he said with a bow to Hermione. ��Forgive me, Madam, but there have 
been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.��

 He whispered urgently in Bogrod��s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off. 

��I am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault ... Very old 
family ... old clients ... This way, please ...�� 

And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. Harry looked 
back at Travers , who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his 
decision. With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, walking meekly in their wake 
as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with 
flaming torches. 

��We��re in trouble; they suspect,�� said Harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off 
the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders, neither Travers nor Bogrod 
showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst. ��They��re 
Imperiused,�� he added, in response to Hermione and Ron��s confused queries about Travers and 
Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. ��I don��t think I did it strongly enough, I 
don��t know ...�� 

And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him 

when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse, ��You need to mean them, Potter!��

 ��What do we do?�� asked Ron. ��Shall we get out now, while we can?�� 

��If we can,�� said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, beyond which 

who knew what was happening.

��383ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We��ve got this far, I say we go on,�� said Harry. 

��Good!�� said Griphook. ��So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no longer have the authority. 
But there will not be room for the wizard.��

 Harry pointed his wand at Travers. 

��Imperio!��

 The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace.

 ��What are you making him do?�� 

��Hide,�� said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that 
came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was sure he could hear 
shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front of Griphook, 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back. 

With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed, They hurried past Travers, who was wriggling 
into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, 
sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the 
tracks. His hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the 
earth, but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; 
the more he thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, 
to have brought along Bellatrix��s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it �C 

They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at 
speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry 
heard Griphook shout, ��No!�� but there was no braking. They zoomed through it. Water filled 
Harry��s eyes and mouth. He could not see or breathe. Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped 
over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage 
wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though 
weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor. 

��C-Cushioning Charm,�� Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to Harry��s 
horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping 
wet and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again. They were realizing it as they 
looked at each other, feeling their own faces. 

��The Thief��s Downfall!�� said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back the deluge

��384ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water. ��It washes away all 
enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are imposers in Gringotts, they have set 
off defenses against us!�� 

Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust his own 
hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see 
Bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment, The Thief��s Downfall seemed to have lifted his 
Imperius Curse. 

��We need him,�� said Griphook, ��we cannot enter the vault without a Gringott��s goblin. And we 
need the clankers!�� 

��Imperio!�� Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the 
sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his 
befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron hurried to pick up the leather 
bag of metal tools. 

��Harry, I think I can hear people coming!�� said Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix��s wand at 
the waterfall and cried, ��Protego!�� They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water 
as it flew up the passageway.

 ��Good thinking,�� said Harry. ��Lead the way, Griphook!�� 

��How are we going to get out again?�� Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after 
the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog. 

��Let��s worry about that when we have to,�� said Harry. He was trying to listen. He thought he 
could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. ��Griphook, how much farther?��

 ��Not far, Harry Potter, not far ...�� 

And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared, but which still 

brought all of them to a halt. 

A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to four or five of 
the deepest vaults in the place. The beast��s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long 
incarceration��� 
under the ground, its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore heavy cuffs��
�� 
from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked 
wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned 
its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth and

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway. 

��It is partially blind,�� panted Griphook, ��but even more savage for that. However, we have the 
means to control it. It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.�� 

Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments 
that when shaken made a long ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils���� 
. Griphook 
handed them out, Bogrod accepted his meekly. 

��You know what to do,�� Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. ��It will expect pain when it 
hears the noise. It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.�� 

They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise echoed off the 
rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry��s skull seemed to vibrate with the din. 
The dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they 
drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guess that it had been 
taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers. 

��Make him press his hand to the door!�� Griphook urged Harry, who turned his wand again 
upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault 
melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and 
goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures �C some with long spines, other with drooping 
wings �C potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown. 

��Search, fast!�� said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. He had described Hufflepuff��s cap 
to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did 
not know what it looked like. He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a 
muffled clunk from behind them. The door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they 
were plunged into total darkness. 

��No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!�� said Griphook as Ron gave a shout of surprise. 

��Light your wands, can��t you? And hurry, we have little time!��

 ��Lumos!�� 

Harry shone his lit wand around the vault, its beam fell upon glittering jewels; he saw the fake 
sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit 
their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them.

 ��Harry, could this be - ? Aargh!��

��386ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet 
tumbling from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, 
with a great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original 
impossible to discern amongst them.

 ��It burned me!�� moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers.

 ��They have added Germino and Flagrante Curses!�� said Griphook. 

��Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless �C and if you 
continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding 
gold!�� 

��Okay, don��t touch anything!�� said Harry desperately, but even as he said it, Ron accidentally 
nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron 
hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.

 ��Stand still, don��t move!�� said Hermione, clutching at Ron. 

��Just look around!�� said Harry. ��Remember, the cup��s small and gold, it��s got a badger 
engraved on it, two handles �C otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw��s symbol anywhere, the 
eagle �C�� 

They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was 
impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the 
ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the 
glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry��s wandlight passed over 
shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher he raised 
the beam, until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.

 ��It��s there, it��s up there!�� 

Ron and Hermione pointed there wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a 
three-way spotlight, the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the 
possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.

 ��And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?�� asked Ron. 

��Accio Cup!�� cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what Griphook 
had told them during their planning sessions. 

 ��No use, no use!�� snarled the goblin.

��387ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Then what do we do?�� said Harry, glaring at the goblin. ��If you want the sword, Griphook, 
then you��ll have to help us more than �C wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it 
here!�� 

Hermione fumbled insider her robes, drew out a beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then 
removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a 
silver flagon��ƺ�;��Ƕ̾�ƿ 
nearby, which did not multiply.

 ��If I can just poke the sword through a handle �C but how am I going to get up there?�� 

The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was 
tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry��s face and 
back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the dragon roar on the other 
side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder. 

They were truly trapped now. There was no way out except through the door, and a horde of 
goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw 
terror in their faces. 

��Hermione,�� said Harry, as the clanking grew louder, ��I��ve got to get up there, we��ve got to get 

rid of it �C��

 She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, ��Levicorpus.�� 

Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like white-
hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of pain, Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins 
were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of 
red-hot treasure, they struggled and yelled has Harry thrust the sword through the handle of 
Hufflepuff��s cup, hooking it onto the blade. 

��Impervius!�� screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from 
the burning metal. 

Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down, Ron and Hermione were waist deep in 
treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk 
out of sight; and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view. 

 Harry seized Griphook��s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling. 

��Liberatocorpus!�� yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the 
swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry��s hand. 

��388ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Get it!�� Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered 
onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. ��Where��s the 
sword? It had the cup on it!��

 The clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening �C it was too late �C 

 ��There!�� 

It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that 
the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of 
Harry��s hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the 
hilt of the sword and swung it high out of Harry��s reach. The tiny golden cup, skewered (���棬 
impale) by the handle on the sword��s blade was flung into the air. The goblin astride him, Harry 
dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even 
while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the 
vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of 
fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, Hermione into the outer chamber. 

Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along the swell of 
replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but 
Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry��s shoulders the moment he could, he had sprinted for 
cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, ��Thieves! Thieves! 
Help! Thieves!�� He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom were holding 
daggers and who accepted him without question. 

Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was 
through. 

��Stupefy!�� he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in. Jets of red light flew into the crowd 
of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards 
running around the corner. 

The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins. The wizards fled, 
doubled-up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing his 
wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, ��Relashio!��

 The cuffs broken open with loud bangs. 

��This way!�� Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing goblins, he

��389ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sprinted toward the blind dragon.

 ��Harry �C Harry �C what are you doing?�� cried Hermione.

 ��Get up, climb up, come on �C�� 

The dragon had not realized that it was free, Harry��s foot found the crook of its hind leg and he 
pulled himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He 
stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron climbed on behind them, and a second 
later the dragon became aware that it was untethered. 

With a roar it reared�ú���վ��, Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to the 
jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles������Ϸ�õ�
С��, and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the 
ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that 
glanced (bounce) off its flanks. 

��We��ll never get out, it��s too big!�� Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its mouth and 
belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer 
force, the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry��s eyes were shut tight against the heat 
and dust. Deafened by the crash of rock and the dragon��s roars, he could only cling to its back, 
expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, ��Defidio!�� 

She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it struggled 
upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins. Harry and Ron 
copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, 
and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind 
them the passage was full of the dragon��s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic 
fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while 
ahead, the dragon��s fire kept their progress clear. 

And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon��s brute strength���� 
, 
they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. Goblins and wizards 
shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings, Turning its horned 
head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, leaving 
them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself

Chapter Twenty-Seven 
The Final Hiding Place 



There was no means of steering; the dragon could not 


see where 
it was going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or 

rolled in 
midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its 

broad 
back. Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, 

London 
unfurling below them like a gray-and-green map. Harry's 
overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that 

had 
seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast's neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and 
the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin, the dragon's wings beating the air 
like the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept 
swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing. 

After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to 
throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison 
as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. 
He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this particular dragon, which 
could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He glanced around constantly, imagining 
that he could feel his scar prickling. 

How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the Lestranges' vault? 
How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? How quickly would they realize what 
had been taken? And then, when they discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort 
would know, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes. 

The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air. It climbed steadily until they were flying 
through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which 
were cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled 
(covered, wrapped) out in patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the 
landscape like strips of matte (not glossy) and glossy ribbon. 

"What do you reckon it's looking for?" Ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north. 

"No idea," Harry bellow back. His hands were numb with cold but he did not dare attempt to

��392ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail 
beneath them, if the dragon headed for open sea; he was cold and numb, not to mention 
desperately hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would 
need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had three highly edible 
humans sitting on its back? 

The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still the dragon flew, cities and 
towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a giant 
dark cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon's back. 

"Is it my imagination," shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of silence, "or are we losing 
height?" 

Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset. The 
landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon, and 
he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight. 

Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in (concentrate on, focus 
on), it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes. 

"I say we jump when it gets low enough!" Harry called back to the others. "Straight into the 
water before it realizes we're here!" They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could 
see the dragon's wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water. 

"NOW!" 

He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake; 
the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a 
freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see 
enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The 
dragon did not seem to have noticed anything; it was already fifty feet away, swooping low over 
the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and 
gasping, from the depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last 
on a distant bank. 

Harry, Ron and Hermione struck out (swim with vigor) for the opposite shore. The lake did not 
seem to be deep. Soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than 
swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass. 

��393ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and 
slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells 
around them. 

When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he had seen them properly 
since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their 
clothing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto 
their many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin 
juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them. They changes and 
then gulped down the juice. 

"Well, on the upside," said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow, 
"we got the Horcrux. On the downside -" 

"-no sword," said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in 
his jeans onto the angry burn beneath. 

"No sword," repeated Ron. "That double-crossing little scab...�� 

Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down 
on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of 
juice. 

"At least we can't wear it this time, that'd look a bit weird hanging around our necks," said Ron, 
wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. 

Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was still drinking. "What'll 
happen to it, do you think?" she asked, "Will it be alright?" 

"You sound like Hagrid," said Ron, "It's a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It's us we 
need to worry about." 

"What do you mean?" 

"Well I don't know how to break this to you," said Ron, "but I think they might have noticed we 

broke into Gringotts." 

All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. Harry's ribs ached, he 
felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed 
until his throat was raw. 

"What are we going to do, though?" said Hermione finally, hiccuping herself back to

��394ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

seriousness. "He'll know, won't he? You-Know-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes!" 

"Maybe they'll be too scared to tell him!" said Ron hopefully, "Maybe they'll cover up -" 

The sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron's voice were extinguished. Pain cleaved 
Harry's head like a sword stroke. He was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards 
faced him, and on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure. 

"What did you say to me?" His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear burned inside him. 
The one thing that he had dreaded -but it could not be true, he could not see how. The goblin was 
trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his. 

"Say it again!" murmured Voldemort. "Say it again!" 

"M-my Lord," stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, "m-my Lord... we t-tried to 
st-stop them... Im-impostors, my Lord... broke - broke into the - into the Lestranges' vault...�� 

"Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing impostors? Who were 
they?�� 

"It was... it was... the P-Potter b-boy and the t-two accomplices...�� 

"And they took?" he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him, "Tell me! What did they 

take?" 

"A... a s-small golden c-cup m-my Lord...�� 

The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger's. He was crazed, frenzied, it could 
not be true, it was impossible, nobody had known. How was it possible that the boy could have 
discovered his secret? 

The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling 
goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified. Bellatrix and Lucius 
Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and 
those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the 
golden cup. 

Alone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they passed before him in vision, his 
treasures, his safeguards, his anchors (����������) to immortality - the diary was destroyed and the 
cup was stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he know, had he already 
acted, had he traced more of them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had 
always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was his now,

��395ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy - 

But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have 
known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer 
of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless, nameless men. How could Lord Voldemort not 
have known, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated? 

True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had thought that was because 
he had no body to fell, being less than ghost... No, surely, the rest were safe... The other Horcruxes 
must be intact... 

But he must know, he must be sure... He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin's corpse as he 
passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain, the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts 


A modicum���� 
of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy know that he had hidden the 
ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the 
connection, the killings had never been traced to him. The ring, surely, was safe. 

And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate its protection? The 
idea of the locket being stolen was absurd... 

As for the school, he alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the Horcrux, because he 
alone had plumbed̽��/��the deepest secrets of that place... And there was still Nagini, who must 
remain close now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his protection... 

But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding places, he must redouble 
protection around each of his Horcruxes... A job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must 
undertake alone... 

Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease flickered inside him. 
Dumbledore had known his middle name... Dumbledore might have made the connection with the 
Gaunts... Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there 
that he would go first... 

The lake, surely impossible... though was there a slight possibility that Dumbledore might have 
known some of his past misdeeds, through the orphanage. 

And Hogwarts... but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe; it would be impossible for Potter 
to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to 
alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle. ... To tell Snape why the boy

��396ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy. 
Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust? 

He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him. He would not be parted 
from the snake anymore ... and he strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark 
garden where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join 
him like a long shadow. ... 

Harry's eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present. He was lying on the bank of 
the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by their 
worried looks, and by the continued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion (trip) into 
Voldemort's mind had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he 
was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and the lake, 
deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun. 

"He knows." His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort's high screams. "He 
knows and he's going to check where the others are, and the last one," he was already on his feet, 
"is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew it." 

"What?" 

Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried. "But what did you see? How do you 
know?" 

"I saw him find out about the cup, I - I was in his head, he's -" Harry remembered the killings "he's 
seriously angry, and scared too, he can't understand how we knew, and now he's going to 
check the others are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape's 
there, because it'll be so hard not to be seen getting in. I think he'll check that one last, but he could 
still be there within hours -" 

"Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?" asked Ron, now scrambling to his feet too. 

"No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn't think about exactly where it is -" 

"Wait, wait!" cried Hermione as Ron caught up to the Horcrux and Harry pulled out the 
Invisibility Cloak again. "We can't just go, we haven't got a plan, we need to -" 

"We need to get going," said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to sleep, looking forward to 
getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now, "Can you imagine what he's going to do 
once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides

��397ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

it isn't safe enough? 

"But how are we going to get in?" 

"We'll go to Hogsmeade," said Harry, "and try to work something out once we see what the 

protection around the school's like. Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this 

time." 

"But we don't really fit -" 

"It'll be dark, no one's going to notice our feet." 

The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water. The dragon had drunk its fill 
and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now 
black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then Hermione 
walked forward and took her place between the other two, Harry pulled the Cloak down as far as it 
would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness.

Chapter Twenty-Eight 

The Missing Mirror 

Harry's feet touched the road. He saw the 


achingly 
familiar Hogsmeade High Street, dark shop fronts, 

and the mist 
line of black mountains beyond the village and the 

curve in the 
road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light 

spilling from 
the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a 

lurch of the 
heart, he remembered with piercing accuracy how 

he had landed 
here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately 

weak 
Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon landing -and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron's 
and Hermione's arms, it happened. 

The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort's when he had realized the cup had 
been stolen. It tore at every nerve in Harry's body, and he knew that their appearance had caused it. 

Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst 
open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft. 

Harry seized Ron's wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to stun. Even 
attempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his wand, and 
the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains. 

"Accio Cloak!" roared one of the Death Eaters Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to 
escape. The Summoning Charm had not worked on it. 

"Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?" yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm and 
then to his fellows. "Spread now. He's here." 

Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them, Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as 
possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in 
the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street 
from the Death Eaters' searching wands. 

"Let's just leave!" Hermione whispered. "Disapparate now!" 

"Great idea," said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, "We know you are 
here, Potter, and there's no getting away! We'll find you!"

"They were ready for us," whispered Harry. "They set up that spell to tell them we'd come. I 
reckon they��ve done something to keep us here, trap us -" 

"What about dementors?" called another Death Eater. "Let'em have free rein, they'd find him 
quick enough!" 

"The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his -" 

"- an' dementors won't kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter's life, nor his soul. He'll be easier to 
kill if he's been Kissed first!" 

There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry. To repel dementors they would have to 
produce Patronuses which would give them away immediately. 

"We're going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!" Hermione whispered. 

Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street. Light was sucked 
from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt 
Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot. 

The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid. They could not 
Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper 
into Harry's flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along 
the wall trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, 
ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with 
their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry 
was sure of it. They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling 
breaths he detested, tasting despair in the air, closing in. He raised his wand, He could not, would 
not suffer the Dementor's Kiss, whatever happened afterward. 

It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered "Expecto Patronum!" 

The silver stag burst from his wand and charged. The Dementors scattered and there was a 
triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight "It's him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, 
it was a stag!" 

The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the Death 
Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a 
grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-side of the narrow street, and a rough voice 
said, "Potter, in here, quick!"

He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway. 

"Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!" muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into 
the street and slammed the door behind him. 

Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single 
candle, the grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog's Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a 
second doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. 
The stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung 
a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant 
sweetness. 

Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, they hurried 
toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the 
Hog's Head's barman, was the only person not wearing a hood. 

"So what?" he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. "So what? You send dementors 
down my street, I'll send a Patronus back at 'em! I'm not having 'em near me, I've told you that. I'm 
not having it!" 

"That wasn't your Patronus," said a Death Eater. "That was a stag. It was Potter's!" 

"Stag!" roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. "Stag! You idiot - Expecto Patronum!" 

Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged toward the High 
Street, and out of sight. 

"That's not what I saw," said the Death Eater, though was less certainly. 

"Curfew's been broken, you heard the noise," one of his companions told the barman. "Someone 

was out on the streets against regulations -" 

"If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!" 

"You set off the Caterwauling Charm?" 

"What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front 
door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven't pressed your little Dark 
Marks, and summoned him. He's not going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, 
now?" 

"Don't worry about us." said one of the Death Eaters, "worry about yourself, breaking curfew!" 

"And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pub's closed down? What will

��401ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

happen to your little sidelines��ҵ 
then?" 

"Are you threatening -?" 

"I keep my mouth shut, it's why you come here, isn't it?" 

"I still say I saw a stag Patronus!" shouted the first Death Eater. 

"Stag?" roared the barman. "It's a goat, idiot!" 

"All right, we made a mistake," said the second Death Eater. "Break curfew again and we won't 

be so lenient!" 

The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out 
from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled 
the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the 
bar, then climbing the stairs. 

Harry's attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece, a small, rectangular mirror, 

propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl. 

The barman entered the room. 

"You bloody fools," he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. "What were you 

thinking, coming here?" 

"Thank you," said Harry. "We can't thank you enough. You saved our lives!" 

The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face, trying to see past the long, 

stringy, wire-gray hair beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a 

piercing, brilliant blue. 

"It's your eye I've been seeing in the mirror." 

There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other. 

"You sent Dobby." 

The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. "Thought he'd be with you. Where've you left 

him? 

��He��s dead,�� said Harry, ��Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.�� 

The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, "I'm sorry to hear it, I liked that 

elf." 

He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them. 

"You're Aberforth," said Harry to the man's back.

��402ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire. 

"How did you get this?" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius's mirror, the twin of the one he 
had broken nearly two years before. 

"Bought it from Dung 'bout a year ago," said Aberforth. "Albus told me what it was. Been trying 
to keep an eye out for you." 

Ron gasped. "The silver doe," he said excitedly, "Was that you too?" 

"What are you talking about?" asked Aberforth. 

"Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!" 

"Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven't I just prove my Patronus is a goat?" 

"Oh," said Ron, "Yeah, well, I'm hungry!" he added defensively as his stomach gave an 

enormous rumble. 

"I got food," said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a 
large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in 
front of the fire. 

Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the fire, 
and the clink of goblets and the sound of chewing. 

"Right then," said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat slumped 
cozily in their chairs. "We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can't be done by 
night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness, Caterwauling Charm's 
set off, they'll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don't reckon I'll be able to pass of a 
stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak 
back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you'll be able 
to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He's been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since 
they tried to arrest him." 

"We're not leaving," said Harry. "We need to get into Hogwarts." 

"Don't be stupid, boy," said Aberforth. 

"We've got to," said Harry. 

"What you've got to do," said Aberforth, leaning forward, "is to get as far from here as you can." 

"You don't understand. There isn't much time. We've got to get into the castle. Dumbledore -I 
mean, your brother - wanted us -"

��403ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth's glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat 
white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog. 

"My brother Albus wanted a lot of things," said Aberforth, "and people had a habit of getting 
hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of 
the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He's gone where none of this can 
hurt him, and you don't owe him anything." 

"You don't understand." said Harry again. 

"Oh, don't I?" said Aberforth quietly. "You don't think I understood my own brother? Think you 
know Albus better than I did?" 

"I didn't mean that," said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit
��ʳ���� 
of food and wine. 

"It's... he left me a job." 

"Did he now?" said Aberforth. "Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you'd expect an 

unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?" 

Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. 

"I -it's not easy, no," said Harry. "But I've got to -" 

"Got to? Why got to? He's dead, isn't he?" said Aberforth roughly. "Let it go, boy, before you 

follow him! Save yourself!" 

"I can't." 

"Why not?" 

"I -" Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. "But you're 

fighting too, you're in the Order of the Phoenix -" 

"I was," said Aberforth. "The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who's won, it's over, 
and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves. It'll never be safe for you here, Potter, 
he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you." 
He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. 

"They'll be in danger as long as they live now everyone knows they've been working with you." 

"I can't leave," said Harry. "I've got a job -" 

"Give it to someone else!" 

"I can't. It's got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all -" 

��404ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?" 

Harry wanted with all his heart to say "Yes," but somehow the simple word would not rise to his 
lips. Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. 

"I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how 
we grew up, and Albus... he was a natural." The old man's eyes traveled to the painting of the girl 
over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. 
There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else. 

"Mr. Dumbledore" said Hermione rather timidly. "Is that your sister? Ariana? 

"Yes." said Aberforth tersely. "Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?" 

Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red. 

"Elphias Doge mentioned her to us," said Harry, trying to spare Hermione. 

"That old berk (British Slang) idiot, stupid person)," muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of 
mead. "Thought the sun shone out of my brother's every office, he did. Well, so did plenty of 
people, you three included, by the looks of it." 

Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that 
had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby's grave, he had 
decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to 
accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no 
desire to doubt again; he did not want to hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. 
He met Aberforth's gaze, which was so strikingly like his brothers', The bright blue eyes gave the 
same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that 
Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it. 

"Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much," said Hermione in a low voice. 

"Did he now?" said Aberforth. "Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about 
very much ended up in a worse state than if he'd left 'em well alone." 

"What do you mean?" asked Hermione breathlessly. 

"Never you mind," said Aberforth. 

"But that's a really serious thing to say!" said Hermione. "Are you -are you talking about your 
sister?" 

Aberforth glared at her, his lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back.

��405ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Then he burst into speech. 

"When my sister was six years old, she was attacked by three Muggle boys. They'd seen her 
doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge, She was a kid, she couldn't control it, no 
witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way 
through the hedge, and when she couldn't show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to 
stop the little freak doing it." 

Hermione's eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as 
Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain. 

"It destroyed her, what they did. She was never right again. She wouldn't use magic, but she 
couldn't get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't 
control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and 
harmless. 

"And my father went after the bastards that did it," said Aberforth, "and attacked them. And they 
locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because if the Ministry had 
known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St. Mungo's for good. They'd have 
seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with 
magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn't keep it in any longer. 

"We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother 
looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy. 

"I was her favourite," he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through 
Aberforth's wrinkles and tangled beard. "Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he 
was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with 
"the most notable magical names of the day," Aberforth sneered. "He didn't want to be bothered 
with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn't do it for my mother, I could 
calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me 
feed the goats. 

"Then, when she was fourteen... See, I wasn't there." said Aberforth. "If I'd been there, I could 
have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn't as young as she was, 
and ... it was an accident. Ariana couldn't control it. But my mother was killed." 

Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but

��406ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; 
whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it. 

"So that put paid to (frustrate, put a stop to) Albus's trip round the world with little Doge. The 
pair of 'em came home for my mother's funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus 
settled down as head of the family. Ha!" Aberforth spat into the fire. 

"I'd have looked after her, I told him so. I didn't care about school. I'd have stayed home and 
done it. He told me I had to finish my education and he'd take over from my mother. Bit of a 
comedownʧ�� 
for Mr. Brilliant, there's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping 
her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks ... till he came." 

And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth��s face. 

"Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to, someone just as bright and 
talented as he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all 
their plans for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were 
so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl neglected, 
what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good? 

"But after a few weeks of it, I'd had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go hack to 
Hogwarts, so I told 'em, both of 'em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now," and Aberforth looked 
downward Harry, and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, 
confronting his elder brother. 

"I told him, you'd better give it up now. You can't move her, she's in no fit state, you can't take 
her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, when you're making your clever speeches, 
trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn't like that." said Aberforth, and his eyes were 
briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses. They turned white and blind again. 
"Grindelwald didn't like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying 
to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother ... Didn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't 
have to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the 
Muggles their place? 

"And there was an argument ... and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the 
Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother's best friend -and Albus was trying to stop him, and 
then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn't

stand it -" 

The color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal wound. 

"-and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, and I don't 

know which of us did it, it could have been any of us - and she was dead." 

His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione's face 
was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion, He 
wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean of it. 

"I'm so ... I'm so sorry," Hermione whispered. 

"Gone," croaked Aberforth. "Gone forever." 

He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat. 

"'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own 
country, and he didn't want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of 

the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the -" 

"He was never free," said Harry. 

"I beg your pardon?" said Aberforth. 

"Never," said Harry. "The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of 
his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn't there. 'Don't hurt them, 
please ... hurt me instead.'" 

Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had 
happened on the island on the lake. 

The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed 
it so thoroughly. 

"He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did," said Harry, 
remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. 

"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana ... It was torture to him, if 
you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free." 

Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause 
he said. "How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good 
than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?" 

A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart.

��408ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry," said Hermione. 

"Why didn't he tell him to hide, then?" shot back Aberforth. "Why didn't he say to him, 'Take 
care of yourself, here's how to survive'?" 

"Because," said Harry before Hermione could answer, "sometimes you've got to think about 
more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!" 

"You're seventeen, boy!" 

"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!" 

"Who says I've given up?" 

"The Order of the Phoenix is finished," Harry repeated, "You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and 

anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves." 

"I don't say I like it, but it's the truth!" 

"No, it isn't." said Harry. "Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the 

knowledge on to me. I'm going to keep going until I succeed -or I die. Don't think I don't know 

how this might end. I've known it for years." 

He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely scowled. 

"We need to get into Hogwarts," said Harry again. "If you can't help us, we'll wait till daybreak, 
leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us -well, now would be a 
great time to mention it." 

Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that were so extraordinarily 
like his brother's. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and 
approached the portrait of Ariana. 

"You know what to do," he said. 

She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, out of the sides of 
their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her 
slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness. 

"Er - what - ?" began Ron. 

"There's only one way in now," said Aberforth. "You must know they've got all the old secret 
passageways covered at both ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside 
the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you 
expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

deputies... well, that's your lookoutǰ;, isn't it? You say you're prepared to die." 

"But what ...?" said Hermione, frowning at Ariana's picture. 

A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back 
toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, 
someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than 
Harry had ever seen. He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were 
ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled 
the portrait. 

Then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real 
tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the 
real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled. 

"I knew you'd come! I knew it, Harry!"

Chapter Twenty-Nine 

The Lost Diadem 

��Neville - what the - how - ?�� 
But Neville had spotted Ron and 



Hermione, 
and with yells of delight was hugging them 

too. The 
longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he 

appeared. 
One of his eyes was swollen yellow and 

purple, there 
were gouge marks on his face, and his general 

air of 
unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with 
happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, ��I knew you��d come! Kept telling Seamus it 
was a matter of time!��

 ��Neville, what��s happened to you?�� 

��What? This?�� Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. ��This is nothing, 
Seamus is worse. You��ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,�� he turned to Aberforth, ��Ab, there 
might be a couple more people on the way.�� 

��Couple more?�� repeated Aberforth ominously. ��What d��you mean, a couple more, 
Longbottom? There��s a curfew and a Camwaulding Charm on the whole village!�� 

��I know, that��s why they��ll be Apparating directly into the bar,�� said Neville. ��Just send them 
down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.�� 

Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into 
the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth.

 ��I don��t know how to thank you. You��ve saved our lives twice.��

 ��Look after 'em, then,�� said Aberforth gruffly. ��I might not be able to save 'em a third time.�� 

Harry chambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Ariana��s portrait. There 
were smooth stone steps on the other side. It looked as though the passageway had been there for 
years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, 
their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall. 

��How long��s this been here?�� Ron asked as they set off. ��It isn��t on the Marauder��s Map, is it 
Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of school?��

��411ҳ��

��They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,�� said Neville. ��There��s no chance of 
getting through any of them now, not with the curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and 
dementors waiting at the exits.�� He started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. ��Never 
mind that stuff ... Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It��s 
everywhere, everyone��s talking about it. Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in 
the Great Hall at dinner!��

 ��Yeah, it��s true,�� said Harry.

 Neville laughed gleefully. ��What did you do with the dragon?��

 ��Released it into the wild,�� said Ron. ��Hermione was all for keeping it as a pet.��

 ��Don��t exaggerate, Ron �C�� 

��But what have you been doing? People have been saying you��ve just been on the run, Harry, 
but I don��t think so. I think you��ve been up to something.��

 ��You��re right,�� said Harry, ��but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven��t heard anything.�� 

��It��s been, well, it��s not really like Hogwarts anymore,�� said Neville, the smile fading from his 

face as he spoke. ��Do you know about the Carrows?��

 ��Those two Death Eaters who teach here?�� 

��They do more than teach,�� said Neville. ��They��re in charge of all discipline. They like 

punishment, the Carrows.��

 ��Like Umbridge?�� 

��Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if 
we do anything wrong. They don��t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as 
much as we do.�� 

��Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it��s 
just the Dark Arts. We��re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who��ve earned 
detentions �C��

 ��What?��

 Harry, Ron, and Hermione��s united voices echoed up and down the passage. 

��Yeah,�� said Neville. ��That��s how I got this one,�� he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his 
cheek, ��I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time 
they��ve ever been top in anything, I expect.��

��Alecto, Amycus��s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We��ve 
all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drive 
wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. 
I got this one,�� he indicated another slash to his face, ��for asking her how much Muggle blood she 
and her brother have got.��

 ��Blimey, Neville,�� said Ron, ��there��s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.�� 

��You didn��t see her,�� said Neville. ��You wouldn��t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps 
when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, 
Harry.�� 

��But they��ve used you as a knife sharpener,�� said Ron, winding slightly as they passed a lamp 
and Neville��s injuries were thrown into even greater relief. 

Neville shrugged. ��Doesn��t matter. They don��t want to spill too much pure blood, so they��ll 
torture us a bit if we��re mouthy but they won��t actually kill us.�� 

Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact 
tone in which he said them. 

��The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are 
giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The 
Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas.��

 ��Neville, she��s all right, we��ve seen her �C��

 ��Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.�� 

From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons 
that Dumbledore��s Army had used to send one another messages. 

��These have been great,�� said Neville, beaming at Hermione. ��The Carrows never rumbled 
(Slang) understand, discover) how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak 
out at night and put graffiti on the walls, Dumbledore��s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. 
Snape hated it.��

 ��You used to?�� said Harry, who had noticed the past tense. 

��Well, it got more difficult as time went on,�� said Neville. ��We lost Luna at Christmas, and 
Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows 
seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then

Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they��d chained up, and they tortured him 

pretty badly. That scared people off.��

 ��No kidding,�� muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward. 

��Yeah, well, I couldn��t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds 

of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. 

That��s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.��

 ��They what?�� said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. 

��Yeah,�� said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, ��well, 
you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to 
behave. I s��pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was,�� 
he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, ��they bit off a bit more than 
they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn��t need to 
send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,�� Neville laughed, ��Dawlish is still in St. Mungo��s and 
Gran��s on the run. She sent me a letter,�� he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, 
��telling me she was proud of me, that I��m my parent��s son, and to keep it up.��

 ��Cool,�� said Ron. 

��Yea,�� said Neville happily. ��Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, 
they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don��t know whether they were planning to 
kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to disappear.�� 

��But,�� said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, ��aren��t �C aren��t we heading straight back for 

Hogwarts?��

 ��'Course,�� said Neville. ��You��ll see. We��re here.�� 

They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another short flight 

of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana��s portrait. Neville pushed it open and 

climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out for unseen people, 

 ��Look who it is! Didn��t I tell you?�� 

As Harry emerged into the room behind the passage, there were several screams and yells, 
��HARRY!�� ��It��s Potter, it��s POTTER!�� ��Ron!�� ��Hermione!�� 

He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. The next moment 
he, Ron and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands

��414ҳ��

shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people. They might have just won a Quidditch 
final. 

��Okay, okay, calm down!�� Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry was able to 
take in their surroundings. 

He did not recognize the dorm at all. It was enormous, and looked rather like the interior of a 
particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship��s cabin. Multicolored hammocks 
were strung from the ceiling and from the balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and 
windowless walls, which were covered in bright tapestry hangings. Harry saw the gold Gryffindor 
lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze 
eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were 
bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wood-
cased wireless. 

 ��Where are we?��

 ��Room of Requirement, of course!�� said Neville. ��Surpassed itself, hasn��t it? The Carrows were 
chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout, I managed to get through the door and 
this is what I found! Well, it wasn��t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there 
was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it��s expanded as more and more of the 

D.A. have arrived.�� 
��And the Carrows can��t get in?�� asked Harry, looking around for the door. 
��No,�� said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke, Seamus��s face 
was bruised and puffy. ��It��s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can��t get at 
us, the door won��t open. It��s all down to Neville. He really gets this room. You��ve got to ask for 
exactly what you need �C like, 'I don��t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in' �C and it��ll 
do it for you! You��ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes. Neville��s the man!�� 

��It��s quite straightforward, really,�� said Neville modestly. ��I��d been in here about a day and a 
half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that��s when the 
passage to Hog��s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He��s been providing us 
with food, because for some reason, that��s the one thing the room doesn��t really do.�� 

��Yeah, well, food��s one of the five exceptions to Gamp��s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,�� 
said Ron to general astonishment.

��415ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��So we��ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,�� said Seamus, ��and it just makes more 
hammocks every time we need room, and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls 
started turning up �C�� 

��-and thought they��d quite like to wash, yes,�� supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not 
noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces. 
Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and 
Michael Corner. 

��Tell us what you��ve been up to, though,�� said Ernie. ��There��ve been so many rumors, we��ve 
been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch.�� He pointed at the wireless. ��You didn��t break 
into Gringotts?��

 ��They did!�� said Neville. ��And the dragon��s true too!��

 There was a smattering (bit) of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow. 

 ��What were you after?�� asked Seamus eagerly. 

Before any of them could parry����,�ܿ� the question with one of their own, Harry felt a 
terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious and 
delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone 
shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred (exhume, unearth) 
golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort��s scream of fury vibrated inside his 
head. 

With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort��s mind again, back to where he stood, 
swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up. 

��Are you all right, Harry?�� Neville was saying. ��What to sit down? I expect you��re tired, aren��t 
-?�� 

��No,�� said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without words that 
Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast. 
If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance.

 ��We need to get going,�� he said, and their expressions told him that they understood.

 ��What are we going to do, then, Harry?�� asked Seamus. ��What��s the plan?�� 

��Plan?�� repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing 
again to Voldemort��s rage. His scar was still burning. ��Well, there��s something we �C Ron,

��416ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hermione, and I �C need to do, and then we��ll get out of here.�� 

Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused. ��What d��you mean, 'get 
out of here'?�� 

��We haven��t come back to stay,�� said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the pain. 
��There��s something important we need to do �C��

 ��What is it?��

 ��I �C I can��t tell you.�� 

There was a ripple of muttering at this, Neville��s brows contracted. ��Why can��t you tell us? It��s 

something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?��

 ��Well, yeah �C��

 ��Then we��ll help you.�� 

The other members of Dumbledore��s Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, others 
solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate 
action. 

��You don��t understand,�� Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. ��We �C we 

can��t tell you. We��ve got to do it �C alone.��

 ��Why?�� asked Neville. 

��Because...�� In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least have a 
private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry 
found it difficult to gather his thoughts. His scar was still searing. ��Dumbledore left the three of us 
a job,�� he said carefully, ��and we weren��t supposed to tell �C I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the 
three of us.�� 

��We��re his army,�� said Neville. ��Dumbledore��s Army. We were all in it together, we��ve been 

keeping it going while you three have been off on your own �C��

 ��It hasn��t exactly been a picnic, mate,�� said Ron. 

��I never said it had, but I don��t see why you can��t trust us. Everyone in this room��s been 
fighting and they��ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone 
in here��s proven they��re loyal to Dumbledore �C loyal to you.�� 

��Look,�� Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter. The 
tunnel door had just opened behind him.

��417ҳ�� 
542ҳ

��We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be here!��

 It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend. 

 ��Hi, everyone!�� said Luna happily. ��Oh, it��s great to be back!��

 ��Luna,�� said Harry distractedly, ��what are you doing here? How did you -?�� 

��I sent for her,�� said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. ��I promised her and Ginny that if 
you turned up I��d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. 
That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.��

 ��Of course that��s what it means,�� said Luna brightly. ��Isn��t it, Harry? We��re going to fight them 
out of Hogwarts?�� 

��Listen,�� said Harry with a rising sense of panic, ��I��m sorry, but that��s not what we came back 
for. There��s something we��ve got to do, and then �C��

 ��You��re going to leave us in this mess?�� demanded Michael Corner. 

��No!�� said Ron. ��What we��re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it��s all about trying to get 

rid of You-Know-Who �C��

 ��Then let us help!�� said Neville angrily. ��We want to be a part of it!�� 

There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His heart seemed to fall. Ginny was 
now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. 
Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile. He had forgotten, he had never fully appreciated, how beautiful 
she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her. 

��Aberforth��s getting a bit annoyed,�� said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of 
greeting. ��He wants a kip, and his bar��s turned into a railway station.�� 

Harry��s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry��s old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She 
smiled at him. 

��I got the message,�� she said, holding up her own fake Galleon and she walked over to sit 
beside Michael Corner. 

 ��So what��s the plan, Harry?�� said George. 

��There isn��t one,�� said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, 

unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely.

 ��Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind,�� said Fred. 

��You��ve got to stop this!�� Harry told Neville. ��What did you call them all back for? This is

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

insane �C�� 

��We��re fighting, aren��t we?�� said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. ��The message said Harry 
was back, and we were going to fight! I��ll have to get a wand, though �C��

 ��You haven��t got a wand -?�� began Seamus.

 Ron turned suddenly to Harry. ��Why can��t they help?��

 ��What?�� 

��They can help.�� He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione, 
who stood between them, ��We don��t know where it is. We��ve got to find it fast. We don��t have to 
tell them it��s a Horcrux.�� 

Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, ��I think Ron��s right. We don��t even 
know what we��re looking for, we need them.�� And when Harry looked unconvinced, ��You don��t 
have to do everything alone, Harry.�� 

Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. Dumbledore had 
warned him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, 
that��s how we grew up, and Albus ... he was a natural ... Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping 
his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had 
that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower ... 

 ��All right,�� he said quietly to the other two. ��Okay,�� he called to the room at large, and all noise 
ceased, Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes (make jokes, tell funny stories) for the 
benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of the looked alert, excited. 

��There��s something we need to find,�� Harry said. ��Something �C something that��ll help us 
overthrow You-Know-Who. It��s here at Hogwarts, but we don��t know where. It might have 
belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone come across 
something with her eagle on it, for instance?�� 

He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, 
but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny��s chair. 

��Well, there��s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost diadem of 
Ravenclaw? Daddy��s trying to duplicate it.�� 

��Yeah, but the lost diadem,�� said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, ��is lost, Luna. That��s sort of 
the point.��

��419ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��When was it lost?�� asked Harry. 

��Centuries ago, they say,�� said Cho, and Harry��s heart sank. ��Professor Flitwick says the 
diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,�� she appealed to her fellow 
Ravenclaws. ��Nobody��s ever found a trace of it, have they?��

 They all shook their heads. 

 ��Sorry, but what is a diadem?�� asked Ron. 

��It��s a kind of crown,�� said Terry Boot. ��Ravenclaw��s was supposed to have magical 
properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.��

 ��Yes, Daddy��s Wrackspurt siphons �C��

 But Harry cut across Luna. ��And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?�� 

They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own 
disappointment was mirrored back at him. 

An object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good 
candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle ... Before he could formulate a new question, 
however, Cho spoke again. 

��If you��d like to see what the diadem��s supposed to look like, I could take you up to our 
common room and show you, Harry. Ravenclaw��s wearing it in her statue.�� 

Harry��s scar scorched again. For a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him, and he 
saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his 
shoulders. Voldemort was flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he 
did not know. Either way, there was hardly any time left. 

��He��s on the move,�� he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at 
them. ��Listen, I know it��s not much of a lead, but I��m going to go look at this statue, at least find 
out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you know �C the other one �C safe.�� 

Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, ��No, Luna will take Harry, won��t you, 

Luna?��

 ��Oooh, yes, I��d like to,�� said Luna happily, as Cho sat down again, looking disappointed.

 ��How do we get out?�� Harry asked Neville.

 ��Over here.�� 

He led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase. ��It

��420ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

comes out somewhere different every day, so they��ve never been able to find it,�� he said. ��Only 
trouble is, we never know exactly where we��re going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, 
they��re always patrolling the corridors at night.��

 ��No problem,�� said Harry. ��See you in a bit.�� 

He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned corners in 
unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall. 

��Get under here,�� Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both 
of them. He gave the wall a little push. 

It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside. Harry glanced back and saw that it had 
resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark corridor. Harry pulled Luna back into the 
shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder��s Map. Holding it 
close to his nose he searched, and located his and Luna��s dots at last. 

��We��re up on the fifth floor,�� he whispered, watching Filch moving away from them, a corridor 

ahead. ��Come on, this way.��

 They crept off. 

Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart hammered that 
fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares of 
moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft 
footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked. Harry and Luna walked, checking 
the Marauder��s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without 
drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst 
fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the 
poltergeist��s approach. 

��This way, Harry,�� breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral 
staircase. 

They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At last they 
reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole, nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, 
and a bronze knocker in the shape an eagle. 

Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, unconnected to arm or 
body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the

��421ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird��s called, a soft, musical voice said, ��Which came 

first, the phoenix or the flame?��

 ��Hmm ... What do you think, Harry?�� said Luna, looking thoughtful.

 ��What? Isn��t there a password?��

 ��Oh no, you��ve got to answer a question,�� said Luna.

 ��What if you get it wrong?�� 

��Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,�� said Luna. ��That way you learn, you 

see?��

 ��Yeah ... Trouble is, we can��t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.�� 

��No, I see what you mean,�� said Luna seriously. ��Well then, I think the answer is that a circle 

has no beginning.��

 ��Well reasoned,�� said the voice, and the door swung open. 

The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had 
ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with 
blue-and-bronze silks. By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding 
mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue 
carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue 
of white marble. 

Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna��s house. The statue 
stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble 
woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet 
slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. 
It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. 
Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw��s plinth to read them.

 ����Wit beyond measure is man��s greatest treasure.����

 ��Which makes you pretty skin, witless,�� said a cackling voice. 

Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The sloping-shouldered 
figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a 
stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm.

Chapter Thirty 
The Sacking of Severus Snape 


The moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry's 


scar burned 
savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and 

he was 
standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, 

and the sea 
was washing around him and there was a triumph in 

his heart �C 
They have the boy. 
A loud bang brought Harry back to where he 

stood. 
Disoriented, he raised his wand, but the witch 

before him 
was already falling forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled. 
��I've never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,�� said Luna, sounding mildly interested. 
��That was noisier than I though it would be.�� 

And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing 
louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories. Luna's spell had woken Ravenclaws 
sleeping above.

 ��Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!�� 

Luna's feet appeared out of nowhere, he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over 
them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the 
common room. There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious. 
Slowly they shuffled in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack 
them. Then one brave little first-year darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe. 

 ��I think she might be dead!�� he shouted with delight. 

��Oh look,�� whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. ��They're 
pleased!��

 ��Yeah... great... �� 

Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort's mind. 
He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave. He had chosen to make sure of the locker 
before coming... but that would not take him long. 

There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the other side,

��423ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker, ��Where do Vanished 
objects go?�� 

��I dunno, do I? Shut it!�� snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of the Carrow 
brother, Amycus, ��Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got him? Open the door!�� 

The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then without warning, there 
came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the door. 

��ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven't got Potter -d'you want to go the same way as the 
Malfoys? ANSWER ME!�� Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did 
not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began 
scampering back up the staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he 
ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a 
second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door. 

 ��May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?��

 ��Trying - to get - through this damned - door!�� shouted Amycus. ��Go and get Flitwick! Get him 
to open it, now!�� 

��But isn't your sister in there�� asked Professor McGonagall. ��Didn't Professor Flitwick let her 
in earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you 
needn't wake up half the castle.��

 ��She ain't answering, you old besomɨ��! You open it! Darn! Do it, now!�� 

��Certainly, if you wish it,�� said Professor McGonagall, with awful coldness. There was a 
genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again.

 ��Where do Vanished objects go?��

 ��Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything,�� replied Professor McGonagall.

 ��Nicely phrased,�� replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open. 

The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the 
threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny 
eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He let out a yell of fury and 
fear. 

��What've they done, the little whelps���� 
?�� he screamed. ��I'll Cruciate the lot of 'em till they 
tell me who did it -and what's the Dark Lord going to say?�� he shrieked, standing over his sister

and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist, ��We haven't got him, and they've gone and 
killed her!�� 

��She's only Stunned,�� said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had stooped down to 
examine Alecto. ��She'll be perfectly all right.�� 

��No she bludgering well won't!�� bellowed Amycus. ��Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! 
She's gone and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we've got Potter!��

 ��'Got Potter'?�� said Professor McGonagall sharply, ��What do you mean, 'got Potter'?�� 

��He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him if we caught 

him!��

 ��Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter belongs in my House!�� 

Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice, and affection 

for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him.

 ��We was told he might come in here!�� said Carrow. ��I dunno why, do I?�� 

Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. Twice they passed right 

over the place where Harry and Luna stood. 

��We can push it off on the kids,�� said Amycus, his pig like face suddenly crafty. ��Yeah, that's 
what we'll do. We'll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them kids up there�� -he looked up at 
the starry ceiling toward the dormitories -��and we'll say they forced her to press her Mark, and 
that's why he got a false alarm. He can punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what's the 
difference?�� 

��Only the difference between truth and lied, courage and cowardice,�� said Professor 
McGonagall, who had turned pale, ��a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable 
to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many 
ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.��

 ��Excuse me?�� 

Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, his face 
within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something 
disgusting she had found stuck to the lavatory seat. 

��It's not a case of what you'll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time's over. It's us what's in 
charge here now, and you'll back me up or you'll pay the price.��

��425ҳ��

And he spat in her face.

 Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, ��You shouldn't have done that.��

 As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, ��Crucio!�� 

The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, 
thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into 
the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. 

��I see what Bellatrix meant,�� said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, ��you need to 
really mean it.�� 

��Potter!�� whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. ��Potter-you're here! What -? 
How -?�� She struggled to pull herself together. ��Potter, that was foolish!��

 ��He spat at you,�� said Harry.

 ��Potter, I - that was very - gallant of you - but don't you realize -?�� 

��Yeah, I do,�� Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. ��Professor McGonagall, 

Voldemort's on the way.�� 

��Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?�� asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the 
Invisibility Cloak. The appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor 
McGonagall, who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at the neck of her old 
tartan dressing gown. 

��I don't think it makes any difference what we call him,�� Harry told Luna. ��He already knows 
where I am.�� 

In a distant part of Harry's brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, he could see 
Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat. He had nearly reached the 
island where the stone basin stood. 

 ��You must flee,�� whispered Professor McGonagall, ��Now Potter, as quickly as you can!�� 

��I can't,�� said Harry, ��There's something I need to do. Professor, do you know where the 
diadem of Ravenclaw is?�� 

��The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not -hasn't it been lost for centuries?�� She sat up a 
little straighter. ��Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle -�� 

��I had to,�� said Harry. ��Professor, there's something hidden here that I'm supposed to find, and 
it could be the diadem - if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick -��

��426ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass. Amycus was coming round. Before Harry 
or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death 
Eater, and said, ��Imperio.�� 

Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled obediently to 
Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. Then he lay down on the floor 
beside Alecto. 

Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared 
out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly together. 

��Potter,�� said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with superb indifference to the 
Carrows' predicament. ��if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does indeed know that you are here -�� 

As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry, setting his scar on fire, 
and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no 
golden locket lay safe beneath the surface. 

��Potter, are you all right.�� said a voice, and Harry came back. He was clutching Luna's shoulder 
to steady himself. 

��Time's running out, Voldemort's getting nearer, Professor, I'm acting on Dumbledore's orders, 
I must find what he wanted me to find! But we've got to get the students out while I'm searching 
the castle. It's me Voldemort wants, but he won't care about killing a few more or less, not now -�� 
not now he knows I'm attacking Horcruxes, Harry finished the sentence in his head. 

��You're acting on Dumbledore's orders?�� she repeated with a look of dawning wonder. Then 
she drew herself up to her fullest height. 

��We shall secure the school against He Who Must Not Be Named while you search for this this 
object.��

 ��Is that possible?�� 

��I think so,�� said Professor McGonagall dryly, ��we teachers are rather good at magic, you 

know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of 

course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape -��

 ��Let me -�� 

��-and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would 

indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo

��427ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the grounds -�� 

��There's a way,�� said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway leading into the 
Hog's Head. 

 ��Potter, we're talking about hundreds of students -�� 

��I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school 

boundaries they won't be interested in anyone who's Disapparating out of Hog's Head.�� 

��There's something in that,�� she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Carrows, and a silver net 
fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and hoisted them into the air, where they 
dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures. ��Come. We must alert 
the other Heads of House. You'd better put that Cloak back on.�� 

She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip burst three 
silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the 
spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and Luna hurried back down. 

Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them. Professor 
McGonagall's tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her 
under the Cloak. 

They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps joined theirs. Harry, 
whose scar was still prickling, heard them first. He felt in the pouch around his neck for the 
Marauder's Map, but before he could take it our, McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their 
company. She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, ��Who's there?��

 ��It is I,�� said a low voice. 

 From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape. 

Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him. He had forgotten the details of Snape's 
appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains 
around his thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, 
but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight.

 ��Where are the Carrows?�� he asked quietly.

 ��Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,�� said Professor McGonagall. 

Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as 
if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held his wand up too, ready to attack.

��428ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I was under the impression,�� said Snape, ��That Alecto had apprehended an intruder.��

 ��Really?�� said Professor McGonagall. ��And what gave you that impression?�� 

Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into 
his skin. 

��Oh, but naturally,�� said Professor McGonagall. ��You Death Eaters have your own private 
means of communication, I forgot.�� 

Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air all about her, and he 
was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing.

 ��I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors Minerva.��

 ��You have some objection?��

 ��I wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour?��

 ��I thought I heard a disturbance,�� said Professor McGonagall.

 ��Really? But all seems calm.��

 Snape looked into her eyes.

 ��Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have. I must insist -�� 

Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed. Her wand slashed through 
the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the 
swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance. She brandished 
her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket. Harry, about to curse Snape, was 
forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled 
the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape. 

Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which 
re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers. Snape avoided them 
only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one 
after another, into its breast. 

��Minerva!�� said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying 
spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their 
nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.

 ��No!�� squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. ��You'll do no more murder at Hogwarts!�� 

Flitwick's spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken shelter. With a clatter it

��429ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

came to life. 

Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers. 

Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When 
Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering 
after him. He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, 
��Coward! COWARD!��

 ��What's happened, what's happened?�� asked Luna. 

Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak 
behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were 
standing at a smashed window. 

 ��He jumped,�� said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room. 

��You mean he's dead?�� Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick's and Sprout's yells of 
shock at his sudden appearance. 

��No, he's not dead,�� said McGonagall bitterly. ��Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a 
wand... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.�� 

With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, bat-like shape flying through the 
darkness toward the perimeter wall. 

There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing. Slughorn had just caught 
up. 

��Harry!�� he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-green silk pajamas. ��My 
dear boy... what a surprise... Minerva, do please explain... Severus... what...?�� 

��Our headmaster is taking a short break,�� said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snapeshaped 
hole in the window. 

��Professor!�� Harry shouted, his hand on his forehead. He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding 
beneath him, and he felt a ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort 
lept from it with murder in his heart.

 ��Professor, we've got to barricade the school, he's coming now!�� 

��Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,�� she told the other teachers. Sprout and 
Flitwick gasped. Slughorn let out a low groan. ��Potter has work to do in the castle on 
Dumbledore's orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while

��430ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Potter does what he needs to do.�� 

��You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who 
indefinitely?�� squeaked Flitwick.

 ��But we can hold him up.�� said Professor Sprout. 

��Thank you, Pomona,�� said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a 
look of grim understanding. ��I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather 
our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are 
over age wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.�� 

��Agreed,�� said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. ��I shall meet you in the 
Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.�� 

And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, ��Tentacula, Devil's Snare. And 
Snargaluff pods... yes, I'd like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.�� 

��I can act from here,�� said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he pointed his 
wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry 
heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the 
grounds. 

��Professor,�� Harry said, approaching the little Charms master. ��Professor, I'm sorry to interrupt, 
but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?�� 

��-Protego Horribillis -the diadem of Ravenclaw?�� squeaked Flitwick. ��A little extra wisdom 
never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!��

 ��I only meant - do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it?��

 ��Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy.��

 Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then, was the Horcrux? 

��We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!�� said Professor 

McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her. 

 They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech. 

��My word,�� he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver. ��What a to-do (Informal) 
panic, fuss)! I'm not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, you 
know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in the most grievous peril -�� 

��I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes also.�� said Professor

��431ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

McGonagall. ��If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you 
attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we 
duel to kill.��

 ��Minerva!�� he said, aghast. 

��The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,�� interrupted Professor 
McGonagall. ��Go and wake your students, Horace.�� 

Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter. He and Luna stayed after Professor McGonagall, 
who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand. 

��Piertotum-oh, for heaven's sake, Filch, not now -�� 

The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting ��Students out of bed! Students 
in the corridors!�� 

��They're supposed to be, you blithering idiot!�� shouted McGonagall. ��Now go and do 
something constructive! Find Peeves!��

 'P-Peeves?�� stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before. 

��Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven't you been complaining about him for a quarter of a 
century? Go and fetch him, at once.�� 

Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, 
hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath. 

��And now -Piertotum Locomator!�� cried Professor McGonagall. And all along the corridor the 
statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the 
floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same. 

��Hogwarts is threatened!�� shouted Professor McGonagall. ��Man the boundaries, protect us, do 
your duty to our school!�� 

Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry, some of them 
smaller, others larger than life. There were animals too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished 
swords and spiked balls on chains. 

��Now, Potter,�� said McGonagall., ��you and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends 
and bring them to the Great Hall - I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.�� 

They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna turning back toward the concealed 
entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing

��432ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and 

prefects.

 ��That was Potter!��

 ��Harry Potter!�� 

��It was him, I swear, I just saw him!�� 

But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement, 

Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back 

down the steep staircase.

 ��Wh-?�� 

As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was packed, far more 
crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were 
Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley.

 ��Harry, what's happening?�� said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs. 

��Voldemort's on his way, they're barricading the school -Snape's run for it. What are you doing 
here? How did you know? 

��We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore's Army,�� Fred explained. ��You couldn't expect 
everyone to miss the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of 
snowballed.��

 ��What first, Harry?�� called George. ��What's going on?�� 

��They're evacuating the younger kids and everyone's meeting in the Great Hall to get 
organized,�� Harry said. ��We're fighting.�� 

There was a great roar and a surge toward the stairs, he was pressed back against the wall as 
they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army, and 
Harry's old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle. 

��Come on, Luna,�� Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand, she took it and followed 
him back up the stairs. 

The crowd was thinning. Only a little knot of people remained below in the Room of 
Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with Ginny. Around them 
stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill and Fleur.

��433ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��You're underage!�� Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached ��I won't permit 

it! The boys, yes, but you, you've got to go home!��

 ��I won't!��

 Ginny's hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother's grip. 

 ��I'm in Dumbledore's Army-��

 ��A teenagers' gang!��

 ��A teenagers' gang that's about to take him on, which no one else has dared to do!�� said Fred. 

��She's sixteen!�� shouted Mrs. Weasley. ��She's not old enough! What you two were thinking 

bringing her with you -��

 Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves. 

��Mom's right, Ginny,�� said Bill gently. ��You can't do this. Everyone underage will have to 
leave, it's only right.�� 

��I can't go home!�� Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. ��My whole family's here, I 
can't stand waiting there alone and not knowing and -�� 

Her eyes met Harry's for the first time. She looked at him beseechingly, but he shook his head 
and she turned away bitterly. 

��Fine,�� she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog's Head. ��I'll say good-by 
now, then, and -�� 

There was a scuffling and a great thump. Someone else had clambered out of the tunnel, 
overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up on the nearest chair, looked around through 
lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and said, ��Am I too late? Has it started. I only just found out, so I I 
-�� 

Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family. 
There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a 
wildly transparent attempt to break the tension. ��So- 'ow eez leetle Teddy?�� 

Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed to be solidifying, like 

ice.

 ��I - oh yes- he's fine!�� Lupin said loudly. ��yes, Tonks is with him- at her mother's -��

 Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen. 

��Here, I've got a picture?�� Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and

��434ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat 
fists at the camera. 

��I was a fool!�� Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph. ��I was an 
idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a �C a -��

 ��Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,�� said Fred.

 Percy swallowed. ��Yes, I was!��

 ��Well, you can't say fairer than that,�� said Fred, holding his hand out to Percy. 

Mrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, pushed Fred aside, and pulled Percy into a 

strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father.

 ��I'm sorry, Dad,�� Percy said. 

 Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son. 

 ��What made you see sense, Perce?�� inquired George. 

��It's been coming on for a while,�� said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner 
of his traveling cloak. ��But I had to find a way out and it's not so easy at the Ministry, they're 
imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off 
ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am.�� 

��Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,�� said George in a good 
imitation of Percy's most pompous manner. ��Now let's get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death 
Eaters'll be taken.�� 

��So, you're my sister in-law now?�� said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur as they hurried off 

toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and George. 

 ��Ginny!�� barked Mrs. Weasley.

 Ginny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliations to sneak upstairs too. 

��Molly, how about this,�� said Lupin. ��Why doesn't Ginny stay here , then at least she'll be on 

the scene and know what's going on, but she won't be in the middle of the fighting?��

 ��I -��

 ��That's a good idea,�� said Mr. Weasley firmly, ��Ginny, you stay in this room, you hear me?�� 

Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father's unusually stern gaze, she 
nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off to the stairs as well.

 ��Where's Ron?�� asked Harry, ��Where's Hermione?��

��435ҳ��

��They must have gone up the Great Hall already,�� Mr. Weasley called over his shoulder.

 ��I didn't see them pass me,�� said Harry.

 ��They said something about a bathroom,�� said Ginny, ��not long after you left.��

 ��A bathroom?�� 

Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of Requirement and 

checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty.

 ��You're sure they said bath -?�� 

But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished. He was looking through the 
high wrought-iron gates with winged boats on pillars at either side, looking through the dark 
grounds toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He 
was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder.

Chapter Thirty-One 
The Battle of Hogwarts 


The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark 


and scattered 
with stars, and below it the four long House tables 

were lined with 
disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others 

in dressing 
gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white 

figures of the 
school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead was fixed 

upon Professor 
McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised 

platform at the 
top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teaches, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, 
and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight. 

"... evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madame Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the 
word, you will organize your House and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation 
point. 

Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the walls, scanning the 
Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and 
shouted; "And what if we want to stay and fight?" 

 There was a smattering���� 
of applause.

 "If you are of age, you may stay." said Professor McGonagall.

 "What about our things?" called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. "Our trunks, our owls?" 

"We have no time to collect possessions." said Professor McGonagall. "The important thing is 
to get you out of here safely."

 "Where's Professor Snape?" shouted a girl from the Slytherin table. 

"He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk (Slang) leave hastily or in a rush; escape)." 
replied Professor McGonagall and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and 
Ravenclaws. 

Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and Hermione.

As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake. 

"We have already placed protection around the castle," Professor McGonagall was saying, "but 
it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move 
quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects -" 

But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. It was high, 
cold, and clear. There was no telling from where it came. It seemed to issue from the walls 
themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain dormant there for 
centuries. 

"I know that you are preparing to fight." There were screams amongst the students, some of 
whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound. "Your efforts are 
futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of 
Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood." 

There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that 
seems too huge to be contained by walls. 

"Give me Harry Potter," said Voldemort's voice, "and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry 
Potter and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded. You 
have until midnight."

 The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have 
found Harry, to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose 
from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and 
screamed, "But he's there! Potter's there. Someone grab him!" 

Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in front of him had 
risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the 
same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward 
Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled 
from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves. 

"Thank you, Miss Parkinson." said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. "You will leave 
the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow."

 Harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the 
other side of the Hall. 

��438ҳ��

"Ravenclaws, follow on!" cried Professor McGonagall. 

Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of 
older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed 
behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall's 
descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on their way.

 "Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!" 

 Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table.

 "Where are Ron and Hermione?"

 "Haven't you found -?" began Mr. Weasley, looking worried. 

But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who 
had remained behind. 

"We've only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast. A battle plan has been 
agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout 
and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers -Ravenclaw, 
Astronomy, and Gryffindor -where they'll have good overview, excellent positions from which to 
work spells. Meanwhile Remus" -he indicated Lupin -"Arthur" -he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, 
sitting at the Gryffindor table -"and I will take groups into the grounds. We'll need somebody to 
organize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school -" 

"Sounds like a job for us." called Fred, indicating himself and George, and Kingsley nodded his 

approval.

 "All right, leaders up here and we'll divide up the troops!" 

"Potter," said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the platform, 
jostling for position, receiving instructions, "Aren't you supposed to be looking for something?" 

 "What? Oh," said Harry, "oh yeah!" 

He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so 
that he could search for it. The inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven 
every other thought from his mind.

 "Then go, Potter, go!" 

 "Right - yeah -" 

He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the entrance hall still

��439ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with 
them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his 
thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his 
thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and 
Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt 
halfway along a passage, where he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the 
Marauder's Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron's of Hermione's names 
anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of 
Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over 
his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate.

 Voldemort thought I'd go to Ravenclaw Tower. 

There it was, a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto Carrow in the 
Ravenclaw common room, and there could be only one explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry 
already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House. 

But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem... and how 
could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found 
the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, 
when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory?

 In living memory... 

Beneath his fingers, Harry's eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the 
way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching 
toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs. 
Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own houses, there 
was much pushing and shouting; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the 
front of the queue, here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called 
desperately for friends or siblings. 

Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as 

loudly as he could over the clamor.

 "Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!" 

He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom of the stairs,

��440ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him.

 "Harry! My dear boy!" 

Nick made to grasp Harry's hands with both of his own; Harry felt as though they had been 

thrust into icy water. 

 "Nick, you've got to help me. Who's the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?" 

 Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.

 "The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require -" 

"It's got to be her - d'you know where she is?" 

 "Let's see...�� 

Nick's head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering over the heads of 

the swarming students. 

 "That's her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair." 

Harry looked in the direction of Nick's transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who 
caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall. 

Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he 
saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from him.

 "Hey - wait - come back!" 

She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry supposed that she was 
beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. 
Close in, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he 
had never spoken. 

 "You're the Gray Lady?"

 She nodded but did not speak.

 "The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?" 

 "That is correct."

 Her tone was not encouraging.

 "Please, I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem."

 A cold smile curved her lips. "I am afraid," she said, turning to leave, "that I cannot help you."

 "WAIT!" 

 He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him. He glanced

��441ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

at his watch as she hovered in front of him. It was a quarter to midnight.

 "This is urgent." he said fiercely. "If that diadem's at Hogwarts, I've got to find it, fast." 

"You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem." she said disdainfully. "Generations of 
students have badgered me -" 

"This isn't about trying to get better marks!" Harry shouted at her, "It's about Voldemort defeating 
Voldemort - or aren't you interested in that?" 

She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated 
as she replied, "Of course I - how dare you suggest -?"

 "Well, help me then!" 

Her composure was slipping. "It -it is not a question of -" she stammered. "-my mother's 

diadem?" 

 "Your mother's?" 

 She looked angry with herself. "When I lived," she said stiffly, "I was Helena Ravenclaw."

 "You're her daughter? But then, you must know what happed to it." 

"While the diadem bestows wisdom," she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together, "I 

doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord -" 

"Haven't I told you, I'm not interested in wearing it!" Harry said fiercely. "There's no time to 
explain -but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you've got to tell 
me anything you know about the diadem!" 

She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and a sense of hopelessness 
engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or 
Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and made to 
turn away when she spoke in a low voice.

 "I stole the diadem from my mother."

 "You - you did what?" 

"I stole the diadem." repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. "I sought to make myself 
cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it." 

He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask, he simply 
listened, hard, as she went on. 

"My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended that she had it

still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts. 

"Then my mother fell ill -fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy����ʵ 
,���� 
, she was desperate to 
see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned����ؾܾ� 
his 
advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so." 

 Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head. 

"He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became 
violent. The baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, 
he stabbed me."

 "The Baron? You mean -?" 

"The Bloody Baron, yes," said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal 
a single dark wound in her white chest. ��When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with 
remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these 
centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence ... as he should." she added bitterly.

 "And - and the diadem?" 

"It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward 
me. Concealed inside a hollow tree."

 "A hollow tree?" repeated Harry. "What tree? Where was this?" 

 "A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother's reach." 

"Albania," repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from confusion, and now he 
understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. "You've 
already told someone this story, haven't you? Another student?" 

 She closed her eyes and nodded.

 "I had... no idea... He was flattering. He seemed to... understand... to sympathize...�� 

Yes, Harry thought. Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaw's desire to 
possess fabulous objects to which she had little right. 

"Well, you weren't the first person Riddle wormed things out of." Harry muttered. "He could be 
charming when he wanted...�� 

So, Voldemort had managed to wheedle��ƭ the location of the lost diadem out of the Gray 
Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, 
perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes. 

��443ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

And wouldn't those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when, so much 
later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years? 

But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in that lowly tree. No, 
the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there �C 

 ��- the night he asked for a job!�� said Harry, finishing his thought.

 ��I beg your pardon?�� 

��He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!�� said Harry. 
Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. ��He must��ve hidden the diadem on his way 
up to, or down from, Dumbledore��s office! But it was well worth trying to get the job �C then he 
might��ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor��s sword as well �C thank you, thanks!�� 

Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded the corner back into the 
entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew 
what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it was... 

Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; that suggested that it was not in 
Ravenclaw Tower �C but if not there, where? What hiding place had Tom Riddle discovered inside 
Hogwarts Castle, that he believed would remain secret forever? 

Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down 
the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he 
leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall. 

Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at 
Harry. 
��Hagrid!�� Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound��s attentions as the enormous 

bearded figure clambered to his feet ��What the -?��

 ��Harry, yer here! Yer here!�� 

Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug, then ran back to 
the shattered window. 

��Good boy, Grawpy!�� he bellowed through the hole in the window. ��I��ll see yer in a moment, 
there��s a good lad!�� 

Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a 
weird, keening (2. lament, mourn) scream. He looked down at his watch. It was midnight. The

��444ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

battle had begun. 

 ��Blimey, Harry,�� panted Hagrid, ��this is it, eh? Time ter fight?��

 ��Hagrid, where have you come from?�� 

��Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,�� said Hagrid grimly. ��Voice carried, didn��t it? 
'Yet got till midnight ter gimme Potter.' Knew yeh mus�� be here, knew that mus�� be happenin��. Get 
down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an�� Grawpy an�� Fang. Smashed our way through the 
boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin�� us, Fang an�� me. Told him ter let me down at the 
castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exactly what I meant, bu�� �C where��s 
Ron an�� Hermione?��

 ��That,�� said Harry, ��is a really good question. Come on.�� 

They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping�����ıĵ��� beside them. Harry 
could hear movement through the corridors all around, running footsteps, shouts; through the 
windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds. 

��Where��re we goin��?�� puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry��s heels, making the floorboards 
quake. 

��I dunno exactly,�� said Harry, making another random turn, ��but Ron and Hermione must be 
around here somewhere.�� 

The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead. The two stone 
gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that 
had sailed through another broken window. Their remains stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry 
leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly. ��Oh, don��t mind me ... I��ll just be 
here and crumble.�� 

Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at 
Xenophilius��s house, wearing that mad headdress �C and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, 
with the stone diadem upon her white curls. 

And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigyФ�� 
;���� 
came 
back to him, that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a 
battered old hat. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly 
stumbled.

 He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him.

��445ҳ��

Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant enough to 
assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, 
Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, 
Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school �C here at least was a secret area he and 
Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered. 

He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a 
dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants. 

��Mandrakes!�� Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. ��Going to lob them over 
the walls �C they won��t like this!�� 

Harry knew now where to go. He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang galloping behind him. They 
passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in 
ruffs and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each others�� canvases, 
screaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, the whole 
castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it 
was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order. 

��It��s all righ��, Fang �C it��s all righ��!�� yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had taken flight as 
slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog, 
leaving Harry alone. 

He forged on��(��ͣ��)Ŭ��ǰ���� through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, 
and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadrigan, rushed from painting to 
painting beside him, clanking along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony 
cantering behind him.

 ��Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see them off!�� 

Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee 
Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a 
secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole. 

��Nice night for it!�� Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and 
terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls 
everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return 
them to their proper place.

��446ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Potter!��

 Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready.

 ��I��ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!�� 

��I know, we��re evacuating,�� Harry said, ��Voldemort��s �C�� 

���C attacking because they haven��t handed you over, yeah,�� said Aberforth. ��I��m not deaf, the 
whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins 
hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you��ve just sent to safety. Wouldn��t it have been a bit 
smarter to keep 'em here?�� 

��It wouldn��t stop Voldemort,�� said Harry, ��and your brother would never have done it.�� 

Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction. 

Your brother would never have done it... Well, it was the truth, Harry thought as he ran on 
again, Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom. 

And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw 
them, Ron and Hermione; both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with 
a broomstick under his arms.

 ��Where the hell have you been?�� Harry shouted. 

 ��Chamber of Secrets,�� said Ron. 

 ��Chamber �C what?�� said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them. 

��It was Ron, all Ron��s idea!�� said Hermione breathlessly. ��Wasn��t it absolutely brilliant? There 
we were, after we left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid 

of it? We still hadn��t got rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk!��

 ��What the �C?��

 ��Something to get rid of Horcruxes,�� said Ron simply. 

Harry��s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione��s arms, great curved fangs; 
torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk. {�Ƿ�Ӧ����Ron��s and Hermione��s arm} 

��But how did you get in there?�� he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. ��You need to speak 
Parseltongue!�� 

��He did!�� whispered Hermione. ��Show him, Ron!�� Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise. 

��It��s what you did to open the locket,�� he told Harry apologetically. ��I had to have a few goes 
to get it right, but,�� he shrugged modestly, ��we got there in the end.��

��447ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He was amazing!�� said Hermione. ��Amazing!��

 ��So ...�� Harry was struggling to keep up. ��So ...�� 

��So we��re another Horcrux down,�� said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled 
remains of Hufflepuff��s cup. ��Hermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn��t had the 
pleasure yet.�� 

��Genius!�� yelled Harry. 

��It was nothing,�� said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. ��So what��s new with 
you?�� 

As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead. All three of them looked up as dust fell 
from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream. 

��I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,�� said Harry, talking fast. ��He hid it 
exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone��s been hiding stuff for centuries. He 
thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.�� 

As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down 
the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was empty except for three women, Ginny, Tonks 
and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry recognized immediately as Neville��s 
grandmother. 

��Ah, Potter,�� she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. ��You can tell us what��s going 
on.�� 

��Is everyone okay?�� said Ginny and Tonks together.

 ����S far as we know,�� said Harry. ��Are there still people in the passage to the Hog��s Head?��

 He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it. 

��I was the last to come through,�� said Mrs. Longbottom. ��I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it 
open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?��

 ��He��s fighting,�� said Harry. 

��Naturally,�� said the old lady proudly. ��Excuse me, I must go and assist him.�� With surprising 

speed she trotted off toward the stone steps. 

 Harry looked at Tonks. 

 ��I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother��s?�� 

��I couldn��t stand not knowing �C�� Tonks looked anguished. ��She��ll look after him �C have you

seen Remus?�� 

��He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds �C��

 Without another word, Tonks sped off. 

��Ginny,�� said Harry, ��I��m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can 
come back in.��

 Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary. 

��And then you can come back in!�� he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks. 
��You��ve got to come back in!��

 ��Hang on a moment!�� said Ron sharply. ��We��ve forgotten someone!�� 

��Who?�� asked Hermione.

 ��The house-elves, they��ll all be down in the kitchen, won��t they?�� 

��You mean we ought to get them fighting?�� asked Harry. 

��No,�� said Ron seriously, ��I mean we should tell them to get out. We don��t want anymore 
Dobbies, do we? We can��t order them to die for us �C�� 

There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione��s arms. Running at Ron, she 
flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and 
broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her 
feet. 

��Is this the moment?�� Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and 
Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. ��Oi! 
There��s a war going on here!�� 

Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. 

��I know, mate,�� said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the 
head with a Bludger, ��so it��s now or never������ʧ����ʧ����, isn��t it?�� 

��Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?�� Harry shouted. ��D��you think you could just �C just 
hold it in until we��ve got the diadem?�� 

��Yeah �C right �C sorry �C�� said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink 
in the face. 

It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that 
they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated

severely. The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the 
nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he 
knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Looking down, Harry saw Grawp 
the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and 
roaring his displeasure.

 ��Let��s hope he steps on some of them!�� said Ron as more screams echoed from close by. 

��As long as it��s not any of our lot!�� said a voice, Harry turned and saw Ginny and Tonks, both 
with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched, 
Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below. 

��Good girl!�� roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth 
again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past. ��They look like they might be 
breaching the north battlements, they��ve brought giants of their own.��

 ��Have you seen Remus?�� Tonks called after him.

 ��He was dueling Dolohov,�� shouted Aberforth, ��haven��t seen him since!�� 

��Tonks,�� said Ginny, ��Tonks, I��m sure he��s okay �C��

 But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth. 

 Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 

��They��ll be all right,�� said Harry, though he knew they were empty words. ��Ginny, we��ll be 
back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe �C come on!�� he said to Ron and Hermione, 
and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do 
the bidding of the next entrant. 

I need the place where everything is hidden. Harry begged of it inside his head, and the door 
materialized on their third run past. 

The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind 
them. All was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its 
towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone students. 

��And he never realized anyone could get in?�� said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence. ��He 
thought he was the only one,�� said Harry. ��Too bad for him I��ve had to hide stuff in my time ... 
this way,�� he added. ��I think it��s down here.�� 

They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others�� footsteps echoing through the

��450ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats... 

��Somewhere near here,�� Harry muttered to himself. ��Somewhere ... somewhere ...�� 

Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized from his one 
previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to 
shiver. There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potions 
book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked 
like an ancient discolored tiara. 

He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained few feet away, when a voice behind 
him said, ��Hold it, Potter.�� 

He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him, shoulder 
to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the small space between their jeering faces he 
saw Draco Malfoy. 

��That��s my wand you��re holding, Potter,�� said Malfoy, pointing his own through the gap 
between Crabbe and Goyle. 

��Not anymore,�� panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. ��Winners, keepers, 
Malfoy. Who��s lent you theirs?��

 ��My mother,�� said Draco. 

Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. He could not hear 

Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem.

 ��So how come you three aren��t with Voldemort?�� asked Harry. 

��We��re gonna be rewarded,�� said Crabbe. His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous 
person. Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. Crabbe was speaking like a small child 
promised a large bag of sweets. ��We 'ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you 
to 'im.�� 

��Good plan,�� said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that he was this close, and 
was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging slowly backward 
toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it 
before the fight broke out ... 

 ��So how did you get in here?�� he asked, trying to distract them. 

��I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,�� said Malfoy, his voice brittle. ��I

��451ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

know how to get in.�� 

��We was hiding in the corridor outside,�� grunted Goyle. ��We can do Disslusion Charms now! 
And then,�� his face split into a gormless grin, ��you turned up right in front of us and said you was 
looking for a die-dum! What��s a die-dum?�� 

��Harry?�� Ron��s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry��s right. ��Are you 
talking to someone?�� 

With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of old furniture, 
of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, ��Descendo!�� 

The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where Ron stood. 

��Ron!�� Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed, and Harry heard 
innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall. He pointed his 
wand at the rampart, cried, ��Finite!�� and it steadied. 

��No!�� shouted Malfoy, staying (stop, restrain) Crabbe��s arm as the latter made to repeat his 
spell. ��If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!�� 

��What��s that matter?�� said Crabbe, tugging himself free. ��It��s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who 
cares about a die-dum?�� 

��Potter came in here to get it,�� said Malfoy with ill-disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness 
of his colleagues. ��so that must mean �C�� 

����Must mean?�� Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity. ��Who cares what you 
think? I don��t take your orders no more, Draco. You an�� your dad are finished.�� 

��Harry?�� shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wall. ��What��s going on?�� 

��Harry?�� mimicked Crabbe. ��What��s going on �C no, Potter! Crucio!�� 

Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe��s curse missed him but hit the stone bust, which flew into 
the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which 
the bust had rested. 

��STOP!�� Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room. ��The Dark 
Lord wants him alive �C�� 

��So? I��m not killing him, am I?�� yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy��s restraining arm. ��But if I 
can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what��s the diff �C?�� 

A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches, Hermione had run around the corner behind him

��452ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe��s head. It only missed because Malfoy pulled him out 

of the way. 

��It��s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!�� 

Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from 
his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy��s 
wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones. 

��Don��t kill him! DON��T KILL HIM!�� Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who were both 
aiming at Harry, their split second��s hesitation was all Harry needed. 

��Expelliarmus!�� 

Goyle��s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark (fortress wall) of objects 
beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of 
Hermione��s second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full 
Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed. 

Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, ��Avada Kedavra!�� again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid 
the jet of green light. The wand-less Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione 
charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she came. 

��It��s somewhere here!�� Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara 

had fallen. ��Look for it while I go and help R �C�� 

��HARRY!�� she screamed. 

A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment��s warning. He turned and saw both 

Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them. 

��Like it hot, scum?�� roared Crabbe as he ran. 

But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size were 
pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their 
touch. 

��Aguamenti!�� Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated 
in the air. 

��RUN!�� 

Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now 

looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It

��453ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge. As they turned a 
corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient (conscious), intent upon killing 
them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts, Flaming serpents, 
chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they 
were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, 
before being consumed by the inferno. 

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view, Harry, Ron and Hermione stopped dead; 
the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, 
and the heat was solid as a wall around them. 

��What can we do?�� Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. ��What can we do?�� 

��Here!�� 

Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to 
Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, 
with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a 
flaming raptor���� 
that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming 
overwhelming, Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contrabandΥ��Ʒ of generations 
of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the 
countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, 
or Goyle anywhere. He swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to 
find them, but there was nothing but fire. What a terrible way to die... He had never wanted this... 

��Harry, let��s get out, let��s get out!�� bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see where the 
door was through the black smoke. 

And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion, the 
thunder of devouring flame. 

��It��s �C too �C dangerous �C!�� Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses giving his eyes 
some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb 
or a face that was not yet charred like wood... 

And he saw them, Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched 
on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, 
but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good. Goyle was too heavy and

��454ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Malfoy��s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry��s. 

��IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I��LL KILL YOU, HARRY!�� roared Ron��s voice, and, as a great 
flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and 
rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry. 

��The door, get to the door, the door!�� screamed Malfoy in Harry��s ear, and Harry sped up, 
following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe, 
and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, 
as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration, cups and shields, a sparkling 
necklace, and an old, discolored tiara �C 

��What are you doing, what are you doing, the door��s that way!�� screamed Malfoy, but Harry 
made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering 
as it dropped toward the maw (throat of an animal) of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught 
it around his wrist �C 

Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight toward the 
place where, he prayed, the door stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was 
screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular 
patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they 
collided with the wall in the corridor beyond. 

Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. Harry rolled over 
and sat up. The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat 
panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious. 

��C-Crabbe,�� choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. ��C-Crabbe ...�� 

��He��s dead,�� said Ron harshly. 

There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge bangs shook the 
castle, and a great cavalcade [.k.vl'ke.d]�����н� 
;����� 
of transparent figures galloped past 
on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when 
the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around, The battle was still going on all around him. He 
could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him. 

��Where��s Ginny?�� he said sharply. ��She was here. She was supposed to be going back into the 
Room of Requirement.��

��455ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Blimey, d��you reckon it��ll still work after that fire?�� asked Ron, but he too got to his feet, 
rubbing his chest and looking left and right. ��Shall we split up and look �C?�� 

��No,�� said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly 
on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. ��Let��s stick together. I say we go �C Harry, what��s 
that on your arm?�� 

��What? Oh yeah �C�� 

He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot, but as 
he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it; WIT BEYOND 
MEASURE IS MAN��S GREATEST TREASURE. 

A blood-like substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem. Suddenly Harry 
felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard 
the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the 
thing that had just fragmented in his fingers. 

��It must have been Fiendfyre!�� whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the broken piece. 

��Sorry?�� 

��Fiendfyre �C cursed fire �C it��s one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, 
ever have dared use it, it��s so dangerous �C how did Crabbe know how to �C?�� 

��Must��ve learned from the Carrows,�� said Harry grimly. 

��Shame he wasn��t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,�� said Ron, whose 

hair, like Hermione��s, was singed, and whose face was blackened. ��If he hadn��t tried to kill us all, 

I��d be quite sorry he was dead.�� 

��But don��t you realize?�� whispered Hermione. ��This means, if we can just get the snake �C�� 

But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor. 
Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail, Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and 
Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling masked and hooded men. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help. Jets of light flew in every direction and the man 
dueling Percy backed off, fast. Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked 
hair. 

��Hello, Minister!�� bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his 
wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. ��Did I mention I��m

��456ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

resigning?�� 

��You��re joking, Perce!�� shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the 
weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes 
erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy 
with glee. 

��You actually are joking, Perce... I don��t think I��ve heard you joke since you were �C�� 

The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the 
two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a 
moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself 
flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood 
that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms, He heard the screams and yells 
of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them. 

And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness. He was half buried in the 
wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of 
the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding 
copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind 
neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more frightened than he had been 
that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life... 

And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded men were 
grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione��s hand as they 
staggered and stumbled over stone and wood. 

��No �C no �C no!�� someone was shouting. ��No! Fred! No!�� 

And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred��s eyes stared 
without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.

Chapter Thirty-Two 
The Elder Wand 


The world had ended, so why had the battle 


not ceased, 
the castle fallen silent in horror, and every 

combatant 
laid down their arms? 
Harry's mind was in free fall, spinning out of 

control, 
unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred 

Weasley 
could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses 

must be 
lying... 
And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them 
from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads. 

"Get down!" Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night, He and Ron had both 
grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred's body, shielding it from 
further harm, and when Harry shouted "Percy, come on, we've got to move!" he shook his head. 

"Percy!" Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron's face as he sezied his elder 
brother's shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. "Percy, you can't do anything for him! 
We're going to -" 

Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of 
a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall. One of Aragog's descendants had 
joined the fight. 

Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was blown backward, its 
legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness. 

"It brought friends!" Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the 
hole in the wall the curses had blasted. More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, 
liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired 
Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled 
back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry's head, so 
close he felt the force of them blow his hair. 

"Let's move, NOW!" 

��458ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred's body under the armpit. 
Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped, together, 
crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the 
way. 

"Here," said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He 
could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body 
was well-hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished but at the 
end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from 
windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could 
not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar, "ROOKWOOD!" and sprinted off in 
the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. 

"Harry, in here!" Hermione screamed. 

She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad 
second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to 
restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy. 

"Listen to me -LISTEN RON!" 

"I wanna help -I wanna kill Death Eaters -" 

His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief. 

"Ron, we're the only ones who can end it! Please �C Ron -we need the snake, we've got to kill the 
snake!" said Hermione. 

But Harry knew how Ron felt. Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of 
revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to 
find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not -but he 
could not permit that idea to form in his mind. 

"We will fight!" Hermione said. "We'll have to... to reach the snake! But let's not lose sight now 
of what we're supposed to be d -doing! We're the only ones who can end it!" 

She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she 
took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry. 
"You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he'll have the snake with him, won't he? Do it, 
Harry, look inside him!"

��459ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him 
Voldemort's thoughts. He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and bangs and 
all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood 
far, far away from them... 

He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on 
the walls and all the windows boarded up except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle 
were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the 
castle stood, but inside the room was dark except for a solitary oil lamp. He was rolling his wand 
between his figners, watching it, his thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he 
had ever found, the room, like the chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive 
to discover... He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem... although Dumbledore's 
puppet had come much farther than he ever expected... too far... 

"My Lord," said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned, there was Lucius Malfoy sitting in 
the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the 
boy's last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. "My Lord... please... my son...�� 

"If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the 

Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?" 

"No -never," whispered Malfoy. 

"You must hope not." 

"Aren't -aren't you afraid, my Lord that Potter might die at another hand but yours?" asked 
Malfoy, his voice shaking. "Wouldn't it be... forgive me... more prudent to call off this battle, enter 
the castle, and seek him y-yourself?" 

"Do not pretend Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has 
happened to your son. And I do not need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have 
come to find me." Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It troubled 
him... and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rearranged... "Go and fetch 
Snape." 

"Snape, m-my Lord?" 

"Snape. Now. I need him. There is a -service -I require from him. Go." 

Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room. Vodlemort continued to

��460ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers, staring at it. "It is the only way, Nagini," he 
whispered, and he looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, 
twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry, transparent 
sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank. 

With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes at the same moment his ears were assaulted 
with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle. 

"He's in the Shrieking Shack. The snake's with him, it's got some sort of magical protection 
around it. He's just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape." 

"Voldemort��s sitting in the shrieking Shack?" said Hermione, outraged. "He's not -he's not even 
FIGHTING?" 

"He doesn't think he needs to fight," said Harry. "He thinks I'm going to go to him." 

"But why?" 

"He knows I'm after Horcruxes -he's keeping Nagini close beside him -obviously I'm going to 
have to go to him to get near the thing -" 

"Right," said Ron, squaring his shoulders. "So you can't go, that's what he wants, what he's 
expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I'll go and get it -" 

Harry cut across Ron. "You two stay here, I'll go under the Cloak and I'll be back as soon as I -" 

"No," said Hermione, "it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and -" 

"Don't even think about it," Ron snarled at her. 

Before Hermione could get farther than "Ron, I'm just as capable -" the tapestry at the top of the 

staircase on which they stood was ripped open. 

"POTTER!" Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were fully 
raised, Hermione shouted "Glisseo!" The stairs beneath their feet flatteneed into a chute and she, 
Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters' 
Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom 
and spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall. 

"Duro!" cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening 
crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it. 

"Get back!" shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione hurled themselves against a door as a 
herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherdd by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She

��461ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

appeared not to notice them. Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she 

turned the corner, they heard her scream, "CHARGE!" 

"Harry, you get the Cloak on," said Hermione. "Never mind us -" 

But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were he doubted anyone would see their 
disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, and the shimmer of spells. 
They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits 
on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, 
while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won 
himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron and 
Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting so 
much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as 
they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great "Wheeeeee!" and looking 
up, Harry saw Peeves zoomign over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, 
whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. 

"ARGH!" A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the damp green roots were 
suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose. 

"Someone's invisible there!" shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing. Dean made the most of 
the Death Eater's momentary distraction, knocking him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov 
attempted to retaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him. 

"LET'S GO!" Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around 
themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of 
Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall. 

"I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!" Draco was on the upper landing, pleading 
with anoter masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked 
around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell 
backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused. 

"And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two-faced (hypocrite; disloyal) 
bastard!" Ron yelled. 

There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall, Death Eaters everywhere Harry 
looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling

Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying or dragging injured 
friends. Harry directed a Stunnning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit 
Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which 
looped���� 
itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase, glass shattered on the left, and the 
Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people 
slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the 
ground, and a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its 
teeth into one of the fallen. 

"NO!" shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, Fenrir Greyback was 
thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters 
and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on 
top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move. 

"I have more!" shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters. "More for any who want 
them! Here -" And with a move like a tennis serve���� 
, she heaved another enormous crystal 
sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall 
and smash through a window. 

At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders 
forced their way into the front hall. Screams of terror rent the air, the fighters scattered, Death 
Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming 
monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever. 

"How do we get out?" yelled Ron over all the screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione 
could answer they were bowled aside; Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing 
his flowery pink umbrella. 

"Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!" he yelled. 

"HAGRID, NO!" Harry forgot everything else, he sprinted out from under the cloak, running 
bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. 

"HAGRID, COME BACK!" But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen, 
Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they 
retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst.

��463ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"HAGRID!" 

Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did not care, He was 
springint down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with 
their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. 

"HAGRID!" 

He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the mdist of the spider swarm, but 
as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down 
out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up. A giant stood 
before him, twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its tree-like hairy shins 
illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive 
fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the 
shelter of the doorway. 

"Oh my -!" shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the 
giant now trying to seize people through the window above. 

"DON'T!" Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione's hand as she raised her wand. "Stun him and he'll 
crush half the castle -" 

"HAGGER?" Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry realzie 
that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan [g��.'g.nt...n] (enormous, huge) 
monster trying to crush people on the upper floors turned around and let out a rorar. The stone 
steps tremebled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp's lopsided mouth fell open, 
showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the 
savagery of lions. 

"RUN!" Harry roared; the ngiht was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and 
he seized Hermione's hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. 
Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward 
the forest before they were brought up shortֹ����ǰ again. 

The air around them had frozen, Harry's breath caught and solidified in his chest. Shapes moved 
out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the 
castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling... 

Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly

muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the 
night, and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead... 

"Come on, Harry!" said Hermione's voice from a very long way away. "Patronuses, Harry, come 
on!" he raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him. 

How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about? He felt as though his soul had already 
half left his body. 

"HARRY, COME ON!" screamed Hermione. 

A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry's 

despair, which was like a promise of a feast... 

He saw Ron's silver terrierһ�ֹ� 
burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw 
Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade, and his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost 
welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling... 

And then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads, the 
dementors fell back before the creatures' approach. Three more people had arrived out of the 
darkness to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast Patronuses, Luna, 
Ernie, and Seamus. 

"That's right," said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and 
this was simply spell practice for the D.A., "That's right, Harry... come on think of something 
happy...�� 

'Something happy?" he said, his voice cracked. 

"We're all still here," she whispered, "we��re still fighting. Come on, now." 

There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost 
him the stag burst from the end of Harry's wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors 
scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding 
battle were loud in his ears. 

"Can't thank you enough," said Ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and Seamus "you just saved 
-" 

With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came lurching out of the darkness from 
the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than any of them. 

"RUN!" Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They all scattered, and not a

542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

second too soon��ǰ 
;���� 
, for the next moment the creature's vast foot had fallen exactly where 
they had been standing. 

Harry looked round, Ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished 
back into the battle. 

"Let's get out of range!" yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed 
through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate 
the darkness. 

"The Whomping willow," said Harry, "go!" 

Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not 
look now, thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and 
outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, 
because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it. 

He sprinted, half-believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in 
the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the 
Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have 
risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great 
tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches. Panting 
and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow's swiping branches, peering through the 
darkness toward its tick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would 
paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath that she could not speak. 

"How -how're we going to get in?" panted Ron. "I can��t -see the place -if we jsut had -
Crookshanks again -" 

"Crookshanks?" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. "Are you a wizard, or 
what?" 

"Oh �C right �C yeah -" Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and 
said "Winguardium Leviosa!" 

The twig flew up from the gruond, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then 
zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow's ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a 
place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still. 

"Perfect!" panted Hermione.

��466ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Wait." 

For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air, Harry 
hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to come... Was he leading Ron and 
Hermione into a trap? 

But the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain, the only way forward was to kill the 

snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was, and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel... 

"Harry, we're coming, just get in there!" said Ron, pushing him forward. 

Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree's roots. It was a much tighter squeeze 
than it had been the last time they had entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged, they had had to 
double up to move throuhgh it nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to 
crawl. Harry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none 
came. They moved in silence, Harry's gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his 
fist. 

At last, the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. 

Hermione tugged at his ankle. "The Cloak!" she whispered. "Put the Cloak on!" 

He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand. With 
difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmered, "Nox," extinguishing his wandlight, and 
continued on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every 
second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light. 

And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled 
by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old 
crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap 
left between crate and wall. The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirlign and 
coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported 
in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. 
Then Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched, Snape was inches away from where he crouched, 
hidden. 

"... my Lord, their resistance is crumbling -" 

"-and it is doing so without your help," said Voldemort in his high, clear voice. "Skilled wizard 
though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there...

��467ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

almost." 

"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my Lord. Please." Snape 
strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering 
whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not 
think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away his position... Voldemort stood up. 
Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him 
gleaming slightly in the semidarkness. 

"I have a problem, Severus," said Voldemort softly. 

"My Lord?" said Snape. 

Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor's baton. 
"Why doesn't it work for me, Severus?" 

In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled or 
was it Voldemort's sibilant˻˻������ sigh lingering on the air? 

"My -my lord?" said Snape blankly. "I do not understand. You -you have performed 
extraordinary magic with that wand." 

"No," said Voldemort. "I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand... 
no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the 
one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago." 

Voldemort's tone was musing, calm, but Harry's scar had begun to throb and pulse. Pain was 

building in his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. 

"No difference," said Voldemort again. 

Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered whether Snape sensed danger, 
was trying to find the right words to reassure his master. 

Voldemort started to move around the room, Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, 
speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry. 

"I have thought long and hard, Severus... do you know why I have called you back from battle?" 

And for a moment Harry saw Snape's profile. His eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its 

enchanted cage. 

"No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter." 

"You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He does not need finding.

��468ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Potter will come to me. I knew his weakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the 
others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at 
any cost. He will come." 

"But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourself -" 

"My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends the 
more, the better -but do not kill him. But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry 
Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable." 

"My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But -let me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me 
bring him to you. I know I can -" 

"I have told you, no!" said Voldemort, and Harry caught the light of red in his eyes as he turned 
again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort's 
impatience in his burning scar. 

"My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!" 

"My Lord, there can be no question, surely -?" 

"-but there is a question, Severus. There is." Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly 
again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape. "Why did both the 

wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?" 

"I -I cannot answer that, my Lord." 

"Can't you?" 

The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry's head, he forced his own fist into his 
mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was 
Voldemort, looking into Snape's pale face. 

"My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice 
it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another's wand. I did 
so, but Lucius's wand shattered upon meeting Potter's." 

"I -I have no explanation, my Lord." Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes 
were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. 

"I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it 
from its previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore." 

And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape's face was like a death mask. It was marble

��469ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank 

eyes. 

"My Lord -let me go to the boy -" 

"All this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here," said Voldemort, his 
voice barely louder than a whisper, "wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be 
what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner... and I 
think I have the answer." 

Snape did not speak. 

"Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good 
and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen." 

"My Lord -" 

"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder 

Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you 

live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine." 

"My Lord!" Snape protested, raising his wand. 

"It cannot be any other way," said Voldemort. "I must master the wand, Severus. Master the 

wand, and I master Potter at last." 

And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Sanpe, who for a split 
second seemed to think he had been reprievedִ�л��� 
, but then Voldemort's intention became 
clear. The snake's cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than 
yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. 

"Kill." 

There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape's face losing the little color it had left; it whitened 
as his black eyes widened, as the snake's fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted 
cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. 

"I regret it," said Voldemort coldly. 

He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and 
take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage 
holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood 
gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance,

��470ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. 

Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes. He had drawn blood biting down 
on his knuckles in an effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between 
crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. 

"Harry!" breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate 
blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, 
he pulled himself up into the room. 

He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying man, he did not know 
what he felt as he saw Snape's white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his 
neck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose 
widening black eyes found Harry as he tried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the 
front of his robes and pulled him close. 

A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat. 

"Take... it... Take... it...�� 

Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it 
gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know 
what to do - 

A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hand by Hermione. Harry lfited the 
silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as 
though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes slackened. 

"Look... at... me...�� he whispered. 

The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair 
seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the 
floor, and Snape moved no more.

Chapter Thirty-Three 
The Prince��s Tale 


Harry remained kneeling at Snape��s side, 
down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold 
close to them that Harry jumped on his feet, the 
tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had 
room. 

Voldemort��s voice reverberated from the 


simply staring 
voice spoke so 
flask gripped 
reentered the 

walls and floor, 

and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the 
residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he 
stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow������� 
away. 

��You have fought,�� said the high, cold voice, ��valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value 
bravery. 

��Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. 
I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste.

 ��Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately.

 ��You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. 

��I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you 
rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that 
hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I 
shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, 
woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.��

 Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry.

 ��Don��t listen to him,�� said Ron. 

��It��ll be all right,�� said Hermione wildly. ��Let��s �C let��s get back to the castle, if he��s gone to the 
forest we��ll need to think of a new plan �C�� 

She glanced at Snape��s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed her. Harry 
gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, 
except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done.

��472ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron 
and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could. 

You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one 
hour in the Forbidden Forest... One hour... 

Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. It could only be an hour or so 
from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone clog 
(wooden shoe), the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of 
Grawp or of his attacker. 

The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or 
shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still 
scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters 
had been blown away.

 ��Where is everyone?�� whispered Hermione.

 Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. 

The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in groups, their 
arms around each other��s necks. The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by 
Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood 
and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. 

The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred��s body, because his 
family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred��s 
chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks. 

Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach 
Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who 
flung an arm around Ron��s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the 
family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred. Remus and Tonks, pale and still 
and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling. 

The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the 
doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see 
who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, 
when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died... 

��473ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks... He yearned not to feel... He 
wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him... 

The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in 
the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape��s last thoughts, and 
he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster��s office. 

 ��Password?�� 

��Dumbledore!�� said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to 
his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind. 

But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that hung all 
around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it 
seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could 
have a clear view of what was going on. 

Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore��s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the 
headmaster��s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had 
always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape��s memories into the wide basin with 
its runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else��s head would be a blessed relief... 
Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories 
swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, 
as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived. 

He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he 
saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant 
skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them 
from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched 
that it looked deliberate, too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a 
grown man, an odd smockŮʽ����-like shirt. 

Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, 
stringy. There was undisguised greed̰�� 
,̰�� 
in his thin face as he watched the younger of the 
two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. 

 ��Lily, don��t do it!�� shrieked the elder of the two. 

But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite

��474ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling 
on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze�߿���ǧ 
artist through the air, staying up far 
too long, landing far too lightly.

 ��Mummy told you not to!�� 

Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, making a 
crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. 

 ��Mummy said you weren��t allowed, Lily!��

 ��But I��m fine,�� said Lily, still giggling. ��Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.�� 

Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the 
girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape 
lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until 
Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, 
opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.

 ��Stop it!�� shrieked Petunia. 

��It��s not hurting you,�� said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to 
the ground. 

��It��s not right,�� said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower��s flight to the ground and 
lingered upon it. ��How do you do it?�� she added, and there was definite longing in her voice. 

��It��s obvious, isn��t it?�� Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped out from behind 
the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, 
remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the 
sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily.

 ��What��s obvious?�� asked Lily. 

Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering 
beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, ��I know what you are.��

 ��What do you mean?��

 ��You��re... you��re a witch,�� whispered Snape. 

 She looked affronted. ��That��s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!��

 She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. 

��No!�� said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did not take off the

��475ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He 
flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously bat-like, like his older self. 

The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles, as 
though it was the safe place in tag׽�Բ���Ϸ. 

��You are,�� said Snape to Lily. ��You are a witch. I��ve been watching you for a while. But 
there��s nothing wrong with that. My mum��s one, and I��m a wizard.��

 Petunia��s laugh was like cold water. 

��Wizard!�� she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his 
unexpected appearance. ��I know who you are. You��re that Snape boy! They live down Spinner��s 
End by the river,�� she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a 
poor recommendation. ��Why have you been spying on us?�� 

��Haven��t been spying,�� said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright 

sunlight. ��Wouldn��t spy on you, anyway,�� he added spitefully, ��you��re a Muggle.��

 Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone. 

��Lily, come on, we��re leaving!�� she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape 
as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the 
only one left to observe him, recognized Snape��s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape 
had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong... 

The scene dissolved and, before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was now in a small 
thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the 
trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the 
ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less pecular in the half light.

 ��... and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.��

 ��But I have done magic outside school!�� 

��We��re all right. We haven��t got wands yet. They let you off when you��re a kid and you can��t 
help it. But once you��re eleven,�� he nodded importantly, ��and they start training you, then you��ve 
got to go careful.�� 

There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry 
knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward 
the boy, and said, ��It is real, isn��t it? It��s not a joke? Petunia says you��re lying to me. Petunia says

��476ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

there isn��t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn��t it?��

 ��It��s real for us,�� said Snape. ��Not for her. But we��ll get the letter, you and me.��

 ��Really?�� whispered Lily. 

��Definitely,�� said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he struck an 

oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny.

 ��And will it really come by owl?�� Lily whispered. 

��Normally,�� said Snape. ��But you��re Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to 

come and explain to your parents.��

 ��Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?��

 Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark 

red hair. 

 ��No,�� he said. ��It doesn��t make any difference.��

 ��Good,�� said Lily, relaxing. It was clear that she had been worrying.

 ��You��ve got loads of magic,�� said Snape. ��I saw that. All the time I was watching you...�� 

His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was 

looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in 

the playground.

 ��How are things at your house?�� Lily asked. 

 A little crease appeared between his eyes.

 ��Fine,�� he said.

 ��They��re not arguing anymore?�� 

��Oh yes, they��re arguing,�� said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them 

apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. ��But it won��t be that long and I��ll be gone.��

 ��Doesn��t your dad like magic?��

 ��He doesn��t like anything, much,�� said Snape.

 ��Severus?��

 A little smile twisted Snape��s mouth when she said his name.

 ��Yeah?��

 ��Tell me about the dementors again.��

 ��What d��you want to know about them for?��

��477ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��If I use magic outside school �C�� 

��They wouldn��t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who do really bad 
stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You��re not going to end up in Azkaban, you��re too 
�C�� 

He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made 

him turn, Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing.

 ��Tuney!�� said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet.

 ��Who��s spying now?�� he shouted. ��What d��you want?�� 

Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling for something 
hurtful to say. 

��What is that you��re wearing, anyway?�� she said, pointing at Snape��s chest. ��Your mum��s 
blouse?�� 

There was a crack. A branch over Petunia��s head had fallen. Lily screamed. The branch caught 
Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears.

 ��Tuney!��

 But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. 

 ��Did you make that happen?��

 ��No.�� He looked both defiant and scared. 

 ��You did!�� She was backing away from him. ��You did! You hurt her!��

 ��No �C no, I didn��t!�� 

But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off 

after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused...

 And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around. He was on platform nine and three quarters, and 
Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who 
greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls 
stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister. Harry moved 
closer to listen. 

��... I��m sorry, Tuney, I��m sorry! Listen �C�� She caught her sister��s hand and held tight to it, even 
though Petunia tried to pull it away. ��Maybe once I��m there �C no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I��m 
there, I��ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!��

��478ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I don��t �C want �C to �C go!�� said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister��s 
grasp. ��You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a �C a...�� 

Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewing in their owners�� arms, over the 
owls, fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some already in their long 
black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad 
cries after a summer apart.

 ���C you think I want to be a �C a freak?��

 Lily��s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away.

 ��I��m not a freak,�� said Lily. ��That��s a horrible thing to say.�� 

��That��s where you��re going,�� said Petunia with relish. ��A special school for freaks. You and 
that Snape boy... weirdos, that��s what you two are. It��s good you��re being separated from normal 
people. It��s for our safety.�� 

Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an air of 
wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice 
was low and fierce. 

��You didn��t think it was such a freak��s school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged 

him to take you.��

 Petunia turned scarlet. ��Beg? I didn��t beg!��

 ��I saw his reply. It was very kind.��

 ��You shouldn��t have read �C�� whispered Petunia, ��that was my private �C how could you �C?��

 Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. 

Petunia gasped. ��That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!�� 

��No �C not sneaking �C�� Now Lily was on the defensive��������. ��Severus saw the envelope, 
and he couldn��t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that��s all! He says there must be 
wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of �C�� 

��Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!�� said Petunia, now as pale as she had 
been flushed. ��Freak!�� she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her parents stood... 

The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it 
clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken 
the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped, outside a

��479ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

compartment in which a group of rowdy��rough, noisy�� boys were talking. Hunched in a corner 
seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane. 
Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then 

looked back out of the window. She had been crying. 
��I don��t want to talk to you,�� she said in a constricted voice. 
��Why not?�� 
��Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.�� 
��So what?�� 
She threw him a look of deep dislike. ��So she��s my sister!�� 
��She��s only a �C�� He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without 

being noticed, did not hear him. 
��But we��re going!�� he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. ��This is it! We��re 

off to Hogwarts!�� 
She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. 
��You��d better be in Slytherin,�� said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little. 
��Slytherin?�� 
One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape 

until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely 
on the two beside the window, saw his father, slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that 
indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked. 

��Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I��d leave, wouldn��t you?�� James asked the boy lounging 

on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile. 
��My whole family have been in Slytherin,�� he said. 
��Blimey,�� said James, ��and I thought you seemed all right!�� 
Sirius grinned. ��Maybe I��ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you��ve got the 

choice?�� 
James lifted an invisible sword. 
��'Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad.�� 
Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. 
��Got a problem with that?��

��480ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No,�� said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. ��If you��d rather be brawny than brainy 

�C��

 ��Where��re you hoping to go, seeing as you��re neither?�� interjected Sirius. 

James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in 

dislike.

 ��Come on, Severus, let��s find another compartment.��

 ��Oooooo...��

 James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed. 

 ��See ya, Snivellus!�� a voice called, as the compartment door slammed...

 And the scene dissolved once more... 

Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt 

faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, ��Evans, Lily!�� 

He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. 
Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had 
touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, ��Gryffindor!�� 

Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it back to Professor 
McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at 
Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make 
room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, 
and firmly turned her back on him. 

The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily and Sirius at 
the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor 
McGonagall called Snape. 

Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. 

��Slytherin!�� cried the Sorting Hat. 

And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the 
Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, 
patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him...

 And the scene changed... 

Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to

��481ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were. 

A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting. 

 ��... thought we were supposed to be friends?�� Snape was saying, ��Best friends?�� 

��We are, Sev, but I don��t like some of the people you��re hanging round with! I��m sorry, but I 

detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he��s creepy! D��you know 

what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?��

 Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face. 

 ��That was nothing,�� said Snape. ��It was a laugh, that��s all �C��

 ��It was Dark Magic, and if you think that��s funny �C�� 

��What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?�� demanded Snape. His color rose again as 

he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.

 ��What��s Potter got to do with anything?�� said Lily. 

��They sneak out at night. There��s something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep 

going?��

 ��He��s ill,�� said Lily. ��They say he��s ill �C��

 ��Every month at the full moon?�� said Snape. 

��I know your theory,�� said Lily, and she sounded cold. ��Why are you so obsessed with them 

anyway? Why do you care what they��re doing at night?��

 ��I��m just trying to show you they��re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.��

 The intensity of his gaze made her blush. 

��They don��t use Dark Magic, though.�� She dropped her voice. ��And you��re being really 
ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the 
Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever��s down there �C�� 

Snape��s whole face contorted and he spluttered, ��Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the 

hero? He was saving his neck and his friends�� too! You��re not going to �C I won��t let you �C�� 

��Let me? Let me?�� Lily��s bright green eyes were slits. 

Snape backtracked at once. 

��I didn��t mean �C I just don��t want to see you made a fool of ... He fancies you, James Potter 
fancies you!�� The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. ��And he��s not... everyone 
thinks... big Quidditch hero �C�� Snape��s bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and

��482ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Lily��s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead. 

��I know James Potter��s an arrogant toerag,�� she said, cutting across Snape. ��I don��t need you to 
tell me that. But Mulciber��s and Avery��s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don��t understand 
how you can be friends with them.�� 

Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures (criticism) on Mulciber and Avery. The 
moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there 
was a new spring in Snape��s step... 

 And the scene dissolved... 

Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against 
the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the 
place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry 
kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into 
the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear 
it again... He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snape��s defense. Distantly he heard 
Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word, ��Mudblood.��

 The scene changed...

 ��I��m sorry.��

 ��I��m not interested.��

 ��I��m sorry!��

 ��Save your breath.��

 It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of 
the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.

 ��I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.��

 ��I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just �C�� 

��Slipped out?�� There was no pity in Lily��s voice. ��It��s too late. I��ve made excuses for you for 
years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little 
Death Eater friends �C you see, you don��t even deny it! You don��t even deny that��s what you��re all 
aiming to be! You can��t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?��

 He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.

 ��I can��t pretend anymore. You��ve chosen your way, I��ve chosen mine.��

��483ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No �C listen, I didn��t mean �C�� 

���C to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I 
be any different?��

 He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back 
through the portrait hole... 

The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform, Harry seemed to fly through 
shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn 
and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. The adult 
Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something 
or for someone... His fear infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, 
and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for �C 

Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air. Harry thought of lightning, but 

Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.

 ��Don��t kill me!��

 ��That was not my intention.�� 

Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the 

branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated 

from below in the light cast by his wand. 

 ��Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?��

 ��No �C no message �C I��m here on my own account!�� 

Snape was wringing his hands. He looked a little mad, with his straggling black hair flying 

around him.

 ��I �C I come with a warning �C no, a request �C please �C�� 

Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air 

around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other.

 ��What request could a Death Eater make of me?��

 ��The �C the prophecy... the prediction... Trelawney...��

 ��Ah, yes,�� said Dumbledore. ��How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?�� 

��Everything �C everything I heard!�� said Snape. ��That is why �C it is for that reason �C he thinks it 

means Lily Evans!��

��484ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��The prophecy did not refer to a woman,�� said Dumbledore. ��It spoke of a boy born at the end 
of July �C�� 

��You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down �C kill them 
all �C�� 

��If she means so much to you,�� said Dumbledore, ��surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? 
Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?��

 ��I have �C I have asked him �C�� 

��You disgust me,�� said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. 
Snape seemed to shrink a little, ��You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? 
They can die, as long as you have what you want?�� 

Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore. ��Hide them all, then,�� he croaked. 
��Keep her �C them �C safe. Please.��

 ��And what will you give me in return, Severus?�� 

��In �C in return?�� Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a 

long moment he said, ��Anything.�� 

The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore��s office, and something was making a 
terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was 
standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like 
a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.

 ��I thought... you were going... to keep her... safe...�� 

��She and James put their faith in the wrong person,�� said Dumbledore. ��Rather like you, 
Severus. Weren��t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?��

 Snape��s breathing was shallow. 

 ��Her boy survives,�� said Dumbledore.

 With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly. 

��Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and color of Lily 

Evans��s eyes, I am sure?��

 ��DON��T!�� bellowed Snape. ��Gone... dead...��

 ��Is this remorse, Severus?��

 ��I wish... I wish I were dead...��

��485ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��And what use would that be to anyone?�� said Dumbledore coldly. ��If you loved Lily Evans, if 
you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.�� 

Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore��s words appeared to take a long 
time to reach him.

 ��What �C what do you mean?��

 ��You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily��s son.��

 ��He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone �C��

 ��The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.�� 

There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own 
breathing. At last he said, ��Very well. Very well. But never �C never tell, Dumbledore! This must 
be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear... especially Potter��s son... I want your word!�� 

��My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?�� Dumbledore sighed, looking 
down into Snape��s ferocious, anguished face. ��If you insist...�� 

The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in front of 
Dumbledore.

 ���C Mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule breaker, delighted to find himself famous, 
attention-seeking and impertinent �C�� 

��You see what you expect to see, Severus,�� said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a 
copy of Transfiguration Today. ��Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and 
reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.�� 

Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, ��Keep an eye on Quirrell, won��t 
you?�� 

A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart 
in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed. 

 ��Well?�� murmured Dumbledore. 

��Karkaroff��s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how 
much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.�� Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore��s 
crooked-nosed profile. ��Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.�� 

��Does he?�� said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from 
the grounds. ��And are you tempted to join him?��

��486ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No,�� said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur��s and Roger��s retreating figures. ��I am not such a 
coward.�� 

��No,�� agreed Dumbledore. ��You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I 
sometimes think we Sort too soon...��

 He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken... 

And now Harry stood in the headmaster��s office yet again. It was nighttime, and Dumbledore 
sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand 
dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand 
at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down 
Dumbledore��s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore��s eyelids fluttered and opened. 

��Why,�� said Snape, without preamble, ��why did you put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely 
you realized that. Why even touch it?�� 

Marvolo Gaunt��s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of 
Gryffindor lay beside it.

 Dumbledore grimaced. ��I... was a fool. Sorely tempted...��

 ��Tempted by what?��

 Dumbledore did not answer. 

��It is a miracle you managed to return here!�� Snape sounded furious. ��That ring carried a curse 
of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for 
the time being �C�� 

Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one 
being shown an interesting curio. 

 ��You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?�� 

Dumbledore��s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. 
Snape hesitated, and then said, ��I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell 
forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.�� 

Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no 
concern to him. ��I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.�� 

��If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, buy you 
more time!�� said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. ��Did you

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

think that breaking the ring would break the curse?�� 

��Something like that... I was delirious, no doubt...�� said Dumbledore. With an effort he 
straightened himself in his chair. ��Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.�� 

Snape looked utterly perplexed. 

Dumbledore smiled. ��I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to 

have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.�� 

Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. 
Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore��s cursed hand, but the 
other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. 

Scowling, Snape said, ��The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely 
punishment for Lucius��s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco��s parents, while they watch him 
fail and pay the price.�� 

��In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,�� said 
Dumbledore. ��Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is 
yourself?��

 There was a short pause. 

 ��That, I think, is the Dark Lord��s plan.�� 

��Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at 
Hogwarts?��

 ��He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.�� 

��And if it does fall into his grasp,�� said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside�԰�, ��I 
have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at Hogwarts?��

 Snape gave a stiff nod. 

��Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened 

teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to 

accept, he likes you �C��

 ���C much less since his father has lost favor.�� 

��All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever 
schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are 
to save him from Lord Voldemort��s wrath.��

��488ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, ��Are you intending to let him 

kill you?��

 ��Certainly not. You must kill me.�� 

There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was 
gnawing a bit of cuttleboneī���. 

��Would you like me to do it now?�� asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. ��Or would you 
like a few moments to compose an epitaphĹ־��;����?�� 

��Oh, not quite yet,�� said Dumbledore, smiling. ��I daresay the moment will present itself in due 
course. Given what has happened tonight,�� he indicated his withered hand, ��we can be sure that it 
will happen within a year.��

 ��If you don��t mind dying,�� said Snape roughly, ��why not let Draco do it?�� 

��That boy��s soul is not yet so damaged,�� said Dumbledore. ��I would not have it ripped apart on 
my account.��

 ��And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?�� 

��You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and 
humiliation,�� said Dumbledore. ��I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is 
coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year��s league. I confess 
I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, 
Greyback is involved �C I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play 
with her food before she eats it.�� 

His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced Harry, as 

though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod. 

 Dumbledore seemed satisfied. ��Thank you, Severus...�� 

The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted 
castle grounds by twilight. 

��What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together?�� Snape asked 
abruptly.

 Dumbledore looked weary. 

��Why? You aren��t trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy will soon have spent 

more time in detention than out.��

��489ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He is his father over again �C�� 

��In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother��s. I spend time with 
Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.��

 ��Information,�� repeated Snape. ��You trust him... you do not trust me.�� 

��It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the 

boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.��

 ��And why may I not have the same information?�� 

��I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much 

time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.��

 ��Which I do on your orders!�� 

��And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the constant danger in which 
you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while 
withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you.�� 

��Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is 
mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord��s mind!�� 

��Voldemort fears that connection,�� said Dumbledore. ��Not so long ago he had one small taste 
of what truly sharing Harry��s mind means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He 
will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.��

 ��I don��t understand.�� 

��Lord Voldemort��s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry��s. 
Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame �C��

 ��Souls? We were talking of minds!��

 ��In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the other.�� 

Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close by the 

Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them.

 ��After you have killed me, Severus �C�� 

��You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!�� snarled Snape, and 
real anger flared in the thin face now. ��You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I 
have changed my mind!�� 

��You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services you owe me, I

��490ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?��

 Snape looked angry, mutinous. 

Dumbledore sighed. ��Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not 
complain that I have no confidence in you...�� 

They were back in Dumbledore��s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat 
quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking. 

��Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could 
he have the strength to do what must be done?��

 ��But what must he do?�� 

��That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a time �C after my 

death �C do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to 

fear for the life of his snake.��

 ��For Nagini?�� Snape looked astonished. 

��Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his 

bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell 

Harry.��

 ��Tell him what?��

 Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. ��Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort 
tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse 
rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort��s soul was blasted apart from the 
whole, and latched (fasten) itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building. Part of 
Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, 
and a connection with Lord Voldemort��s mind that he has never understood. And while that 
fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord 
Voldemort cannot die.�� 

Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they were so far away 

from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears. 

 ��So the boy... the boy must die?�� asked Snape quite calmly.

 ��And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.�� 

Another long silence. Then Snape said, ��I thought... all those years... that we were protecting

��491ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

him for her. For Lily.�� 

��We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try 
his strength,�� said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. ��Meanwhile, the connection between them 
grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth. Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know 
him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly 
mean the end of Voldemort.��

 Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.

 ��You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?��

 ��Don��t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?��

 ��Lately, only those whom I could not save,�� said Snape. He stood up. ��You have used me.��

 ��Meaning?�� 

��I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was 
supposed to be to keep Lily Potter��s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a 
pig for slaughter �C�� 

��But this is touching, Severus,�� said Dumbledore seriously. ��Have you grown to care for the 
boy, after all?��

 ��For him?�� shouted Snape. ��Expecto Patronum!�� 

From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe. She landed on the office floor, bounded once 

across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her 

silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. 

 ��After all this time?��

 ��Always,�� said Snape. 

And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his 

desk. 

��You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry��s departure from his aunt and 
uncle��s,�� said Dumbledore. ��Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so 
well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry��s 
safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the 
chase, be sure to act your part convincingly... I am counting upon you to remain in Lord 
Voldemort��s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the

��492ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Carrows...�� 

Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus��s face 
looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration. 

��You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,�� Snape murmured, ��that they use decoys. 
Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It��s the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have 
suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?��

 ��I understand,�� murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused... 

Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night. He was 
accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really 
George... A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin��s 
back.

 ��Sectumsempra!�� shouted Snape. 

 But the spell, intended for the Death Eater��s wand hand, missed and hit George instead �C 

And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius��s old bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his 
hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words, 

could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind��s going, 
personally! 
Lots of love, 
Lily 

Snape took the page bearing Lily��s signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then 
he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily 
laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of 
drawers... 

And now Snape stood again in the headmaster��s study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into 

his portrait.

 ��Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood �C��

 ��Do not use that word!��

 ���C the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her!�� 

��Good. Very good!�� cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster��s chair. ��Now, 

Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor �C and he

��493ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry��s mind and see you acting for him 
�C�� 

��I know,�� said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side. It 
swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor. 

��And you still aren��t going to tell me why it��s so important to give Potter the sword?�� said 
Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes. 

��No, I don��t think so,�� said Dumbledore��s portrait. ��He will know what to do with it. And 
Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley��s 
mishap �C��

 Snape turned at the door. 

 ��Don��t worry, Dumbledore,�� he said coolly. ��I have a plan...�� 

And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the 
carpeted floor in exactly the same room Snape might just have closed the door.

Chapter Thirty-Four 
The Forest Again 


Finally, the truth. Lying with his face 
the dusty carpet of the office where he had

last that he was not supposed to survive. His 
walk calmly into Death��s welcoming arms. 
way, he was to dispose of Voldemort��s 
links to life, so that when at last he flung 


pressed into 
once thought 
understood at 
job was to 
Along the 
remaining 
himself 

across Voldemort��s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and 
the job that ought to have been done in Godric��s Hollow would be finished. Neither would live, 
neither could survive. 

He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of death, it 
pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats 
were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for 
the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest? 

Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding inside him. 
Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he 
had never really thought of the thing itself. His will to live had always been so much stronger than 
his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was 
over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself, dying. 

If he could only have died on that summer��s night when he had left number four, Privet Drive, 
for the last time, when the noble phoenix feather wand had saved him! If he could only have died 
like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched 
himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved ... He envied even his parents�� deaths now. 
This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. He felt 
his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him; 
the portraits on the walls were all empty. 

Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own

��495ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and 
nerve and pounding heart? It would all be gone ... or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath 
came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes. 

Dumbledore��s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan, Harry had 
simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had never questioned his own 
assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his life span had always been 
determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of 
destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only 
Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the 
dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not 
be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort. 

And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep going to the 
end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn��t he? 
Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that 
he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead 
in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind��s eye, and for a moment he could hardly 
breathe. Death was impatient ... 

But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed. The snake survived. One Horcrux 
remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean 
an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it ... Ron and Hermione would know what 
needed to be done, of course ... That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in 
two others ... so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on ... 

Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the 
incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. I must die. It must end. 

Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as though he had 
parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes and no explanations, he was determined 
of that. This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop 
him would waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his 
seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed. 

��496ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had 
little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime��s beats before the end. He did not 
look back as he closed the office door. 

The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died. The 
portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its 
remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were 
crammed. 

Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, at last 
walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to 
be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he 
reached the front doors easily. 

Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in 
from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach, Colin Creevey, 
though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was 
tiny in death. 

��You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,�� said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin 
over his shoulder in a fireman��s lift and carried him into the Great Hall. 

Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his 
hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off on the steps again into the darkness to recover 
more bodies. 

Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving around, 
trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the 
people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt 
he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would 
he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this. 

He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the morning, and the 
deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath, waiting to see 
whether he could do what he must.

 Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body.

 ��Neville.��

��497ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!�� 

Harry had pulled off the Cloak. The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born out of a desire 
to make absolutely sure.

 ��Where are you going, alone?�� Neville asked suspiciously.

 ��It��s all part of the plan,�� said Harry. ��There��s someting I��ve got to do. Listen - Neville -�� 

��Harry!�� Neville looked suddenly scared. ��Harry, you��re not thinking of handing yourself 
over?�� 

��No,�� Harry lied easily. ��'Course not ... this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a 
while. You know Voldemort��s snake. Neville? He��s got a huge snake ... Calls it Nagini ...��

 ��I��ve heard, yeah ... What about it?��

 ��It��s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they -�� 

The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible to keep 
talking. But he pulled himself together again. This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep 
a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that 
three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take Harry��s place. There would 
still be three in the secret.

 ��Just in case they��re - busy - and you get the chance -��

 ��Kill the snake?��

 ��Kill the snake,�� Harry repeated.

 ��All right, Harry. You��re okay, are you?��

 ��I��m fine. Thanks, Neville.��

 But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on. 

 ��We��re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?��

 ��Yeah, I -�� 

The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could not go on. Neville did 
not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to 
look for more bodies. 

Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone else was moving not far 
away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he 
realized it was Ginny.

��498ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother.

 ��It��s all right,�� Ginny was saying. ��It��s ok. We��re going to get you inside.��

 ��But I want to go home,�� whispered the girl. ��I don��t want to fight anymore!��

 ��I know,�� said Ginny, and her voice broke. ��It��s going to be all right.�� 

Ripples of cold undulated (cause to move in waves) over Harry��s skin. He wanted to shout out 
to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was 
going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home... 

But he was home. Hogwards was the first and best home he had known. He and Voldemort and 
Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here. 

Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With a huge effort Harry 
forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed, and wondered whether she 
had sensed someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back. 

Hagrid��s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang scrabbling at 
the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper 
kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting 
slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert ... 

 He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped. 

A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, and he was not 
sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had not strength left for a Patronus. He could no 
longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the 
smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious. To think that people had years and 
years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same 
time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was 
ended, the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. 

The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he 
pulled it out. 

I open at the close. 

Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as slowly as 
possible, it seemed to have sped up, and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have 
bypassed thought. This was the close. This was the moment.

��499ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, ��I am about to die.�� 

The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco��s wand beneath the 
Cloak, and murmured, ��Lumos.�� 

The black stone with is jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the 
Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. 
The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible. 

And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about bringing them 

back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them. They were fetching him.

 He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times. 

He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail 
bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the 
forest. He opened his eyes and looked around. 

They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most closely the 
Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. 
Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him. And on 
each face, there was the same loving smile. 

James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, 
and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley��s. 

Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life. He loped 
(move with a fast relaxed stride) with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face. 

Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker. He looked 
happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings. 

Lily��s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew closer to him, and her 
green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at 
him enough. 

 ��You��ve been so brave.��

 He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to stand and look 
at her forever, and that would be enough. 

 ��You are nearly there,�� said James. ��Very close. We are so proud of you.��

 ��Does it hurt?��

��500ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The childish question had fallen from Harry��s lips before he could stop it.

 ��Dying? Not at all,�� said Sirius. ��Quicker and easier than falling asleep.��

 ��And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,�� said Lupin.

 ��I didn��t want you to die,�� Harry said. These words came without his volition. ��Any of you. I��m 
sorry -�� 

He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him. ��-right after you��d had your 
son ... Remus, I��m sorry.�� 

��I am sorry too,�� said Lupin. ��Sorry I will never know him ... but he will know why I died and I 
hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.�� 

A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at Harry��s 
brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision. 

 ��You��ll stay with me?��

 ��Until the very end,�� said James.

 ��They won��t be able to see you?�� asked Harry.

 ��We are part of you,�� said Sirius. ��Invisible to anyone else.��

 Harry looked at his mother.

 ��Stay close to me,�� he said quietly. 

And he set off. The dementors�� chill did not overcome him; he passed through it with his 
companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they marched through the old 
trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. 
Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the 
forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him. Beside him, 
making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his 
courage, and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other. 

His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without conscious 
instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who 
walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the 
castle, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled 
and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort ... 

A thud and a whisper. Some other living creature had stirred close by. Harry stopped under the

Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too. 

��Someone there,�� came a rough whisper close at hand. ��He��s got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it 
be -?�� 

Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree, their wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and 
Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and 
Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything.

 ��Definitely heard something,�� said Yaxley. ��Animal, d��you reckon?�� 

��That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,�� said Dolohov, glancing over his 
shoulder.

 Yaxley looked down at his watch. 

 ��Time��s nearly up. Porter��s had his hour. He��s not coming.��

 ��Better go back,�� said Yaxley. ��Find out what the plan is now.�� 

He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, knowing that 
they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled 
at him, and his father nodded encouragement. 

They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov 
stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had 
once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarms of descendants he had 
spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause. 

A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a crowd of 
completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and hooded; others 
showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the 
scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; 
the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked 
defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. 

Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his white hands 
folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently 
in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting 
in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini 
floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.

��502ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up. 

 ��No sign of him, my Lord,�� said Dolohov. 

Voldemort��s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly he 
drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers. 

 ��My Lord -�� 

Bellatrix had spoken. She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little bloody but 
otherwise unharmed. 

Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but eyed him in 
worshipful fascination. 

��I thought he would come,�� said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on the leaping 
flames. ��I expected him to come.�� 

Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing itself against 
his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. His hands were 
sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He 
did not want to be tempted to fight. 

 ��I was, it seems ... mistaken,�� said Voldemort.

 ��You weren��t.�� 

Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster. He did not want to sound 
afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers, and out of the corner of his 
eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that 
moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them. 

The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose 
together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood, 
but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the 
fire between them.

 Then a voice yelled, ��HARRY! NO!�� 

He turned. Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His massive body shook the 
branches overhead as he struggled, desperate.

 ��NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT��RE YEH - ?��

 ��QUIET!�� shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand, Hagrid was silenced.

��503ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, her breast 
heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the 
glittering cage behind Voldemort��s head.

 Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no attempt to draw it. He knew that the 
snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses 
would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted 
his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless 
smile curled the lipless mouth. 

��Harry Potter,�� he said very softly. His voice might have been part of the spitting fire. ��The 
Boy Who Lived.�� 

None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting, Everything was waiting. Hagrid was 
struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing 
look, and the feel of her lips on his... 

Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, 
wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it 
to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear...

 He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone.

Chapter Thirty-Five 
King's Cross 


He lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was 


perfectly 
alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He 

was not 
perfectly sure that he was there himself. 
A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to 

him that he 
must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he 

was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing 
against which he lay existed too. 

Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. 
Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. 
He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered 
that he had eyes. 

He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His 
surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into 
surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply 
there, a flat, blank something on which to be. 

He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses 
anymore.

 Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him, the small soft 
thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly 
indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, 
shameful.

 For the first time, he wished he were clothed. 

Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. He took 
them and pulled them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had 
appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. 

He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he 
looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight.

��505ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering 
noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. 

Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his 
eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear 
domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for �C 

He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, 
naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed��Ƥ 
-looking, and it lay 
shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for 
breath. 

He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach 
it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near 
enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to 
comfort it, but it repulsed him.

 ��You cannot help.�� 

He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly���õ� and upright, 
wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. 

��Harry.�� He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. 
��You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.�� 

Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay 
whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance 
away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into 
the other, staring at his old headmaster��s face. Dumbledore��s long silver hair and beard, the 
piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose, everything was as he had 
remembered it. And yet ... 

 ��But you��re dead,�� said Harry.

 ��Oh yes,�� said Dumbledore matter-of-factly.

 ��Then ... I��m dead too?�� 

��Ah,�� said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. ��That is the question, isn��t it? On the 
whole, dear boy, I think not.��

 They looked at each other, the old man still beaming.

��506ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Not?�� repeated Harry.

 ��Not,�� said Dumbledore. 

��But...�� Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be 
there. ��But I should have died �C I didn��t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!��

 ��And that,�� said Dumbledore, ��will, I think, have made all the difference.�� 

Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light; like fire, Harry had never seen the 

man so utterly, so palpably content.

 ��Explain,�� said Harry.

 ��But you already know,�� said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together.

 ��I let him kill me,�� said Harry. ��Didn��t I?��

 ��You did,�� said Dumbledore, nodding. ��Go on!��

 ��So the part of his soul that was in me ...�� 

Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of 

encouragement on his face.

 ��... has it gone?�� 

��Oh yes!�� said Dumbledore. ��Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your 
own, Harry.�� 

��But then ...�� Harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled 
under the chair. ��What is that, Professor?��

 ��Something that is beyond either of our help,�� said Dumbledore. 

��But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,�� Harry started again, ��and nobody died for me this 
time �C how can I be alive?�� 

��I think you know,�� said Dumbledore. ��Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, 
in his greed and his cruelty.�� 

Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which 
they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, 
he and Dumbledore and the stunted�谭 
...�ķ���creatures under the chair were the only beings 
there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

 ��He took my blood,�� said Harry. 

��Precisely!�� said Dumbledore. ��He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your

��507ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

blood in his veins, Harry, Lily��s protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he 
lives!�� 

��I live ... while he lives? But I thought ... I thought it was the other way around! I thought we 
both had to die? Or is it the same thing?�� 

He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and 
glanced back at it yet again.

 ��Are you sure we can��t do anything?��

 ��There is no help possible.��

 ��Then explain ... more,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. 

��You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered 
his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the 
murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was 
even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, 
the would-be victim who had survived. 

��And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not 
value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children��s tales, of love, loyalty, and 
innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power 
beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. 

��He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the 
enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrafice alive, 
and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort��s one last hope for 
himself.��

 Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.

 ��And you knew this? You knew �C all along?�� 

��I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,�� said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in 
silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and 
tremble. 

��There��s more,�� said Harry. ��There��s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he 
borrowed?��

 ��As to that, I cannot be sure.��

��508ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Have a guess, then,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. 

��What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together 
into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is 
unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted or explained it to 
Voldemort. 

��Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when 
he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to 
strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother��s sacrafice into himself. If he could only have 
understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to 
touch your blood... But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, 
and might never have murdered at all. 

��Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more 
securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a 
wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The 
cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had 
never expected. 

��He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the 
possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, 
your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, 
something that echoed the relationship between their masters. 

��I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort��s wand that 
night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him 
when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated 
some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius��s wand had 
ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of 
Voldemort��s own deadly skill, What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy��s stand?��

 ��But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?�� asked Harry. 

��My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-
advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. 
Otherwise it was a wand like any other ... though a good one, I am sure,�� Dumbledore finished

��509ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

kindly. 

Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things 
like time here.

 ��He killed me with your wand.�� 

��He failed to kill you with my wand,�� Dumbledore corrected Harry. ��I think we can agree that 
you are not dead �C though, of course,�� he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, ��I do not 
minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.�� 

��I feel great at the moment, though,�� said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. 
��Where are we, exactly?�� 

��Well, I was going to ask you that,�� said Dumbledore, looking around. ��Where would you say 
that we are?�� 

Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an 
answer ready to give. 

��It looks,�� he said slowly, ��like King��s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there 
are no trains as far as I can see.��

 ��King��s Cross station!�� Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. ��Good gracious, really?��

 ��Well, where do you think we are?�� asked Harry, a little defensively.

 ��My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.�� 

Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then 
remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location. 

��The Deathly Hallows,�� he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from 
Dumbledore��s face. 

 ��Ah, yes,�� he said. He even looked a little worried. 

 ��Well?�� 

For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. 

He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. 

��Can you forgive me?�� he said. ��Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? 
Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my 
mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better 
man.��

��510ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��What are you talking about?�� asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore��s tone, by the sudden tears 

in his eyes.

 ��The Hallows, the Hallows,�� murmured Dumbledore. ��A desperate man��s dream!��

 ��But they��re real!�� 

��Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,�� said Dumbledore. ��And I was such a fool. But you 

know, don��t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.��

 ��What do I know?�� 

Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue 

eyes.

 ��Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?�� 

��Of course you were,�� said Harry. ��Of course �C how can you ask that? You never killed if you 
could avoid it!�� 

��True, true,�� said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. ��Yet I too sought a 
way to conquer death, Harry.�� 

��Not the way he did,�� said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, 
beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. ��Hallows, not 
Horcruxes.��

 ��Hallows,�� murmured Dumbledore, ��not Horcruxes. Precisely.��

 There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. 

 ��Grindelwald was looking for them too?�� he asked.

 Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. 

��It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,�� he said quietly. ��Two clever, arrogant boys 
with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric��s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, 
because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had 
died.��

 ��So it��s true?�� asked Harry. ��All of it? The Peverell brothers �C�� 

��-were the three brothers of the tale?�� said Dumbledore, nodding. ��Oh yes, I think so. Whether 
they met Death on a lonely road ... I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply 
gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them 
being Death��s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such

��511ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

creations. 

��The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to 
daughter, right down to Ignotus��s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the 
village of Godric��s Hollow.��

 Dumbledore smiled at Harry.

 ��Me?�� 

��You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your 
parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his 
undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to 
examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could 
not help taking a closer look... It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, 
perfect in every respect ... and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!��

 His tone was unbearably bitter. 

��The Cloak wouldn��t have helped them survive, though,�� Harry said quickly. ��Voldemort knew 
where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn��t have made them curse-proof.��

 ��True,�� sighed Dumbledore. ��True.��

 Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him.

 ��So you��d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?��

 ��Oh yes,�� said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry��s eyes. ��You 

know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.��

 ��But I don��t despise you �C�� 

��Then you should,�� said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. ��You know the secret of my 
sister��s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father 
sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own 
life to care for Ariana.

 ��I resented it, Harry.�� 

Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry��s head, into the 
distance.

 ��I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. 

��Do not misunderstand me,�� he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again.

��512ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I loved them, I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more 
selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. 

��So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a 
wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! 
And then of course, he came...��

 Dumbledore looked directly into Harry��s eyes again. 

��Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles 
forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of 
the revolution.

 ��Oh, I had a few scruples�˼�. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for 
the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I 
know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If 
the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. 

��And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they 
fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The 
Resurrection Stone �C to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, 
I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. 

��And the Cloak ... somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could 
conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can 
be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might 
be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for 
the legend said that the man who had united all three objects would then be truly master of death, 
which we took to mean ��invincible.�� 

��Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel 
dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. 

��And then ... you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, 
and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not 
want to hear that I could not set forth and seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow 
(under one��s care, ����). 

��The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in

��513ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana ... after all my mother��s 
care and caution ... lay dead upon the floor.�� 

Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to 
find that he could touch him, He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained 
control. 

��Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for 
seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams 
in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and 
learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. 

��Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense 
power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. 
Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.��

 ��But you��d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scimgeour!�� burst out Harry. 

��Would I?�� asked Dumbledore heavily. ��I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, 
that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those 
who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have 
leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle����, ����because they must, and find to their 
own surprise that they wear it well.

 ��I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher �C��

 ��You were the best -�� 

��-you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, 
Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than 
I feared him. 

��Oh, not death,�� said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry��s questioning look. ��Not what he could 
do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. 
It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually 
cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly, you would be right, Harry. I 
dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not 
merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her 
life.

��I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it 
would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, 
and I had to do what I could.

 ��Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.�� 

Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana 
dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last 
he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of Erised, and why 
Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. 

They sat in silence for a long time, and the whipmerings of the creature behind them barely 
disturbed Harry anymore. 

At last he said, ��Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, 
pretended he had never had it.��

 Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. 

��They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that is true. 
I would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to 
Voldemort was his attempt to make amends ... to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow ...�� 

��... or maybe from breaking into your tomb?�� suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his 
eyes.

 After another short pause Harry said, ��You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.��

 Dumbledore nodded. 

��When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts -the 
Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons -I 
lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a 
curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and 
my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry, I was... 

��I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite 

the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.��

 ��Why?�� said Harry. ��It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What��s wrong with that?��

 ��Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest 

of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not boast of it, and not to kill

with it. I was permitted to tame and use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. 

��But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiousity, and so it could never have worked for me as it 
works for you, its true owners. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who 
are at peace, rather than enable my self-sacrafice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the 
Hallows.�� 

Dumbledore patted Harry��s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not 

help himself. How could he remain angry with Dumbledore now?

 ��Why did you have to make it so difficult?��

 Dumbledore��s smile was tremulous. 

��I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head 
might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those 
tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If 
you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, 
because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and 
understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.��

 ��And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?�� 

��I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a 
Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry. I doubt that he would have been interested 
in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom 
would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.��

 ��But you expected him to go after the wand?�� 

��I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort��s in the graveyard of 
Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had 
kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that 
explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead 
of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you 
possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any 
other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He 
believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor 
Severus ...��

��If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn��t 

you?��

 ��I admit that was my intention,�� said Dumbledore, ��but it did not work as I intended, did it?��

 ��No,�� said Harry. ��That bit didn��t work out.�� 

The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking 

for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in 

the long minutes, like softly falling snow. 

 ��I��ve got to go back, haven��t I?��

 ��That is up to you.��

 ��I��ve got a choice?�� 

��Oh yes,�� Dumbledore smiled at him. ��We are in King��s Cross you say? I think that if you 

decided not to go back, you would be able to ... let��s say ... board a train.��

 ��And where would it take me?��

 ��On,�� said Dumbledore simply.

 Silence again.

 ��Voldemort��s got the Elder Wand.��

 ��True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.��

 ��But you want me to go back?�� 

��I think,�� said Dumbledore, ��that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be 
finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from 
returning here than he does.�� 

Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath 
the distant chair. 

��Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love. By 
returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems 
to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.�� 

Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the 
forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading 
back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they 
looked for a long moment into each other��s faces.

��Tell me one last thing,�� said Harry, ��Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?�� 

Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry��s ears even though 
the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. 

��Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it is not 
real?��

Chapter Thirty-Six 
The Flaw in the Plan 



He was lying facedown on the ground again. 


The smell of the 
forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold 

hard ground 
beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses 

which have been 
knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his 

temple. Every 
inch of him ached, and the place where Killing 

Curse had hit him 
felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did 

not stir, but he 
remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an akward angle and his mouth 
gaping. 

He had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried 

footsteps, whispers, and solicitous (anxious, concerned) murmurs filled the air.

 "My Lord... my Lord...�� 

It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but 
allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed 
beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight 
cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, 
stuffed out of sight. 

"My Lord...��

 "That will do���ˣ�����," said Voldemort's voice. 

More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate to see what 
was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a milimeter. 

Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from 
him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside 
Voldemort. 

Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters had been 
huddled around Voldemort, who seem to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when 
he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both 
of them had briefly fallen unconcious and both of them had now returned...

��519ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"My Lord, let me -" 

"I do not require assitance," said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry 
pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. "The boy ... Is he dead?" 

There was a complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their 
concentraded gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or 
an eyelid might twitch. 

"You," said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shrick of pain. "Examine him. Tell 
me whether he is dead." 

Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart 
thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though 
it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not 
gone to plan ... 

Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, and felt his heart. He could 

hear the woman's fast breathing, her pounding of life against his ribs. 

"Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?" 

The whisper was barely audible, her lips were an inch from his scar, her head bent so low that 

her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers. 

"Yes," he breathed back. 

He felt the hand on his chest contract, her nails pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had 

sat up. 

 "He is dead!" Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. 

And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his 

eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. 

Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would 
be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no 
longer cared whether Voldemort won. 

"You see?" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. "Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no 
man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!" 

Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied (sully tarnish; 
stain, disgrace) upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove

��520ҳ��

Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet 
the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses 
flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, 
and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of 
laughter. 

"Now," said Voldemort, "we go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. 
Who shall drag the body? No - Wait -" 

There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the ground 
trembling beneath him. 

"You carry him," Voldemort said. "He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick 
up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable -" 

Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous 
hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms 
trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid 
cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate��ʾ 
,���� 
to 
Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. 

"Move," said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-
growing trees, back through the forest. 

Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent (motionless, inactive), his mouth 
lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, 
and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck 
of Harry Potter... 

The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and 
falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the 
jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open 
ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed 
eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. 

 "BANE!" 

Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open. "Happy now, are yeh, that yeh 
didn't fight, yeh cowardly bunch o' nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter's - d-dead ...?" 

��521ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs 
were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters 
called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening 
of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. 

 "Stop." 

Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, because he 
lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping 
breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. 

The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father's 
stag kept guardian in his heart. 

Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a 
moment later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground, crashing upon 
Harry's eardrums. 

"Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down 
your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. 

"The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and 
the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, 
woman or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle 
now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and 
sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build togheter." 

There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry 
did not dare open his eyes again. 

"Come," said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. 
Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front them, wearing the great 
snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility 
of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who 
marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness ... 

 "Harry," sobbed Hagrid. "Oh, Harry ... Harry ...�� 

Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his 
ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs

��522ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

of life from those within. 

 "Stop." 

The Death Eaters came to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the opne front 
doors of the school. He could see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light 
streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had 
tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms.

 "NO!" 

The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor 
McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another women laughing nearby, and knew that 
Bellatrix gloried��ϲ in McGonagall's despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the 
open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to 
face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for themselves. He saw Voldemort 
standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head with a single white finger. He closed his 
eyes again.

 "No!" 

"No!"

 "Harry! HARRY!" 

Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry wanted nothing 
more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd 
of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eathers, until - 

"SILENCE!" cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was 

forced upn them all. "It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!"

 Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. 

"You see?" said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the 
place where he lay. "Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, 
ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!" 

"He beat you!" yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting 
and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.

 "He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds," said Voldemort, and there was a 
relish in his voice for the lie. "killed while trying to save himself - " 

��523ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

But Voldemort broke off, Harry heard a scuffle (quarrel, minor fight) and a shout, then another 
bang, a flash of light, and grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had 
broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort. Harry saw the figure hit the ground. 
Disarmed. Voldemort throwing the challenger's wand aside and laughing. 

"And who is this?" he said in his soft snake's hiss. "Who has volunteered to demonstrate what 

happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?" 

 Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. 

"It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much 

trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?" 

"Ah, yes, I remember," said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to 
his feet, unarmed and unproctected, standing in the no-man's-land��յش� 
between the survivors 
and the Death Eaters. "But you are a pureblood, aren't you, my brave boy?" Voldemort asked 
Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled in fists. 

 "So what if I am?" said Neville loudly. 

"You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable 
Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom." 

"I'll join you when hell freezes over," said Neville. "Dumbledore's Army!" he shouted, and 
there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed 
unable to hold. 

"Very well," said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in 
the most powerful curse. "If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On 
your head," he said quietly, "be it." 

Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of 
one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through 
the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end 
and it dangled, emtpy and ragged, the Sorting Hat. 

"There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School," said Voldemort. "There will be no more 
Houses. The emblem, shield and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slythering, will suffice 
everyone. Won't they, Neville Longbottom?" 

He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto Neville's

��524ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

head, so that it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in 
front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of 
Hogwarts at bay. 

"Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue 
to oppose me," said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst 
into flames. 

Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry 

could not bear it, He must act - 

 And then many things happened at the same moment. 

They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of 
people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war 
cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castel and yelled, 
"HAGGER!" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's giants. They ran at Grawp like bull 
elephants making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were 
suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled 
the Invisibilty Cloak from inside his robes, swunt it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville 
moved too. 

In one swift, fluid motin, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming hat 
fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle - 

The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the 
sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampending centaurs, and yet, it seemd to draw every eye. 
With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head, which spun high into the air, 
gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort's mouth was open in a scream 
of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's body thudded to the ground at his feet. 

Hidden beneath the Invisibilty Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and 
Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand. Then, over the screams and roars and the 
thunderous stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid's yell came loudets of all.

 "HARRY!" Hagrid shouted. "HARRY - WHERE'S HARRY?" 

Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing 
the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearar thundered the reinforcements that had come from

��525ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatues soaring around the heads of Voldemort's 
giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and 
pummeled them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike were being 
forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, 
and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the 
retreating crowd. 

Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffetted into the entrance hall. He was 
searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed 
into the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and 
right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and 
Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing 
inside it. 

And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw 
Charlie Weasly overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emeral pyjamas. They 
seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts 
student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. 
The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as 
behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges. 

The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving 
knives�����õĲ͵� 
and cleaver (heavy butcher knife), and at their head, the locker of Regulus 
Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din, 
"Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of 
brave Regulus! Fight!" 

They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive 
with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of 
numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else 
simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde. 

 But it was not over yet, Harry sped between duelers, past struggling prisoners, and into he Great 
Hall.

��526ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting (smite -hit, strike) 
all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the 
Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. 

Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a 
scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone 
wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir 
Greyback. Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and 
Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. 

Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, Kingsley all at once, and there was a cold 
hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him. 

Bellatrix was still fighing too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled 
three at once, Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to 
them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed 
death by an inch. 

He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few 

steps he was knocked sideways.

 "NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!" 

Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms, Bellatrix spun on the spot, 

roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger. 

"OUT OF MY WAY!" shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a simple swipe of her 
wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed 
and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from 
both wands, the floor around the withces' feet became hot and cracked; both woman were fighting 
to kill. 

"No!" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. "Get back! 
Get back! She is mine!" 

Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three 
opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack 
and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. 

"What will happen to your children when I've killed you?" taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her

��527ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

master, capering (jump about) as Molly's curses danced around her. "When Mummy's gone the 
same way as Freddie?" 
"You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!" screamed Mrs. Weasley. 
Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled 
backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. 
Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, 
directly over her heart. 

Bellatrix's gloating smile froze, her eyes seemd to bulge. For the tiniest space of time she knew 
what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemord 
screamed. 

Harry felt as though he turned into slow motin, he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn 
blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, 
best leutenant exploded with the force of a bomb, Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at 
Molly Weasley. 

"Protego!" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and 
Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. 
The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of "Harry!" "HE'S ALIVE!" were 
stifled at once. 
The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked 
at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other. 
"I don't want anyone else to try to help," Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice 

carried like a trumpet call. "It's got to be like this. It's got to be me."

 Voldemort hissed. 

"Potter doesn't mean that," he said, his red eyes wide. "This isn't how he works, is it? Who are 
you going to use as a shield today, Potter?" 

"Nobody," said Harry simply. "There are no more Horcruxes. It's just you and me. Neither can 
live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good." 

"One of us?" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake 
that was about to strike. "You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, 
and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings��Ļ�����?"

"Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?" asked Harry. They were still moving 
sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and 
for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. "Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? 
Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?" 

"Accidents!" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was 
frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. 
"Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men 
and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!" 

"You won't be killing anyone else tonight," said Harry as they circled, and stared into each 
other's eyes, green into red. "You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I 
was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people -" 

 "But you did not!" 

"-I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. 
Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. 
You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?"

 "You dare -" 

"Yes, I dare," said Harry. "I know things you don't know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important 
things that you don't. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?" 

Voldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily 
mesmerized at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final 
secret.

 "Is it love again?" said Voldemort, his snake's face jeering. "Dumbledore favorite solution, love, 
which he claimed conqered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and 
breaking like and old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Modblood 
mother like a cockroack, Potter -and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time 
and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?" 

"Just one thing," said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart 
by nothing but the last secret. 

"If it is not love that will save you this time," said Voldemort, "you must believe that you have 
magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?"

��529ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I believe both," said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snake-like face, though it was 
instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his 
screams; humorles and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. 

"You think you know more magic than I do?" he said. "Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has 
performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?" 

"Oh he dreamed of it," said Harry, "but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what 
you've done." 

"You mean he was weak!" screamed Voldemort. "Too weak to dare, too weak to take what 
might have been his, what will be mine!"

 "No, he was cleverer than you," said Harry, "a better wizard, a better man."

 "I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!"

 "You thought you did," said Harry, "but you were wrong." 

For the frist time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew 

breath as one. 

"Dumbledore is dead!" Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though they would cause him 
undurable pain. "His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, 
Potter, and he will not return!" 

"Yes, Dumbledore is dead," said Harry calmly, "but you didn't have him killed. He chose his 
own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you 
thought was your servant." 

"What childish dream is this?" said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did 
not waver from Harry's. 

"Severus Snape wasn't yours," said Harry. "Snape was Dumbledore's. Dumbledore's from the 
moment you starting hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you 
can't understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?" 

Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each 
other apart. 

"Snape's Patronus was a doe," said Harry, "the same as my mother's, because he loved her for 
nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized," he said as 
he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, "he asked you to spare her life, didn't he?" 

��530ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"He desired her, that was all," sneered Voldemort, "but when she had gone, he agreed that there 
were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him -" 

"Of course he told you that," said Harry, "but he was Dumbledore's spy from the moment you 
threatened her, and he's been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying 
when Snape finished him!" 

"It matters not!" shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but 
now let out a cackle of mad laughter. "It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore's, or 
what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape's 
supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! 

"Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be 
the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy -I reached the wand before 
you could get your hands on it. I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape 
three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! 
Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!"

 "Yeah, it did." said Harry. "You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise you think what 

you've done ... Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle ..." 

 "What is this?" 

Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had socked 
Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes 
whiten. 

"It's your one last chance," said Harry, "it's all you've got left ... I've seen what you'll be 
otherwise ... Be a man... try... Try for some remorse ..." 

 ��You dare -?�� said Voldemort again. 

��Yes, I dare,�� said Harry, ��because Dumbledore��s last plan hasn��t backfired on me at all. It��s 
backfired on you, Riddle.�� 

Voldemort��s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco��s very tightly. 
The moment, he knew, was seconds away. 

��That wand still isn��t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. 
Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.��

 ��He killed -��

��531ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Aren��t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore��s death was planned 
between them! Dumbledore instended to die, undefeated, the wand��s last true master! If all had 
gone as planned, the wand��s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from 
him!�� 

��But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!�� Voldemort��s voice shook with 
malicious pleasure. ��I stole the wand from its last master��s tomb! I removed it against the last 
master��s wishes! Its power is mine!�� 

��You still don��t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn��t enough! Holding it, using it, 
doesn��t make it really yours. Didn��t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard ... The 
Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a 
hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing 
exactly what he had done, or that the world��s most dangerous wand had given him its 
allegiance ...�� 

Voldemort��s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building 

inside the wand pointed at his face.

 ��The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.��

 Blank shock showed in Voldemort��s face for a moment, but then it was gone. 

��But what does it matter?�� he said softly. ��Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference 
to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand. We duel on skill alone ... and after I have 
killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy ...�� 

��But you��re too late,�� said Harry. ��You��ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered 
Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him.��

 Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. 

��So it all comes down to this, doesn��t it?�� whispered Harry. ��Does the wand in your hand know 

its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does ... I am the true master of the Elder Wand.�� 

A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun 
appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so 
that Voldemort��s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled 
his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco��s wand:

 ��Avada Kedavra!��

��532ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Expelliarmus!�� 

The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead 
center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw 
Voldemort��s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, 
spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the 
master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the 
unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms 
splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane 
finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and 
unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two 
wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy��s shell. 

One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended, and then the tumult broke 
around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce 
new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron 
and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts 
that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and 
Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word 
that anyone was shouting, not tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some 
part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the 
reason it was over at last... 

The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was 
an indispensible part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and 
celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their 
guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to 
occur to no one. 

He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear 
the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and 
down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being 
captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley

��533ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. 

They moved Voldemort��s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away form the bodies of 
Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had 
replaced the House tables, but now nobody was sitting according to House anymore. All were 
jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze 
lay recovering in the corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were 
throwing food into his laughing mouth. 

After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.

 ��I��d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,�� she said. 

 ��I��d love some,�� he replied.

 ��I��ll distract them all,�� she said. ��Use your cloak.�� 

And before he could say a word, she had cried, ��Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!�� and 
pointed out the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over 
himself, and got to his feet. 

Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; 
she was sitting with her head on her mother��s shoulder. There would be time to talk later, hours 
and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside 
his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he 
walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they 
were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked, he 
saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most.

 ��It��s me,�� he muttered, crouching down between them. ��Will you come with me?�� 

They stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks 
were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains 
occurred every few steps as their climbed. 

Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a 
victory song of his own composition: 

We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter��s the one, 

And Voldy��s gone moldy, so now let��s have fun! 

��Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn��t it?�� said Ron, pushing

��534ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

open a door to let Harry and Hermione through. 

Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and 
the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. 
Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an 
explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the 
truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the 
forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement, when at last they 
arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their 
destination. 

Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster��s study had been 
knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it 
would be able to distinguish passwords anymore.

 ��Can we go up?�� he asked the gargoyle.

 ��Feel free,�� groaned the statue. 

They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an 
escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. 

He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an 
earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth 
of Voldemort. 

But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts 
were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they 
reached through their frames to grip each other��s hands; they danced up and down on their chairs 
in which they have been painted, Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was 
waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Niggelus called, in his high, reedy voice, ��And let it be noted 
that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!�� 

But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the 
headmaster��s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long 
silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry with the same balm 
as phoenix song. 

At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping

��535ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, 
and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one 
last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. 

��The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,�� he began, ��I dropped it in the forest. I don��t know 
exactly where, but I��m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?�� 

��My dear boy, I do,�� said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. 
��A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone 
know else know where it fell?��

 ��No one,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.

 ��I��m going to keep Ignotus��s present, though,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.

 ��But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!��

 ��And then there��s this.�� 

Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even 
in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. 

 ��I don��t want it.�� said Harry.

 ��What?�� said Ron loudly. ��Are you mental?��

 ��I know it��s powerful,�� said Harry wearily. ��But I was happier with mine. So ...�� 

He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly still 
just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be 
repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would. 

He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster��s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder 
Wand, and said, ��Reparo.�� 

As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He 
picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and 
hand were rejoicing at their reunion. 

��I��m putting the Elder Wand,�� he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous 
affection and admiration, ��back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like 
Ignotus, its power will be broken, won��t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. 
That��ll be the end of it.��

 Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other.

��536ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Are you sure?�� said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at 

the Elder Wand. 

 ��I think Harry��s right,�� said Hermione quietly. 

��That wand��s more trouble than it��s worth.�� said Harry. ��And quite honestly,�� he turned away 
from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in 
Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, ��I��ve had 
enough trouble for a lifetime.��

Epilogue 
Nineteen Years Later 


Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The 


morning of 
the first of September was crisp as an apple, and as the 

little family 
bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great 

sooty station, 
the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians 

sparkled like 
cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top 

of the laden 
trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them 

hooted 
indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's 
arm.

 "It won't be long, and you'll be going too," Harry told her. 

 "Two years," sniffed Lily. "I want to go now!" 

The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier 
between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; 

his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. 

 "I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!"

 "James, give it a rest!" said Ginny. 

"I only said he might be," said James, grinning at his younger brother. "There's nothing wrong 

with that. He might be in Slytherin." 

But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With 
a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his 
mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. 

"You'll write to me, won't you?" Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the 

momentary absence of his brother.

 "Every day, if you want us to," said Ginny. 

"Not every day," said Albus quickly, "James says most people only get letters from home about 

once a month."

 "We wrote to James three times a week last year," said Ginny.

 "And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts," Harry put in. "He likes

��538ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

a laugh, your brother." 

Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the 
barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and 
three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet 
Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had 
already disappeared. 

"Where are they?" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made 

their way down the platform.

 "We'll find them," said Ginny reassuringly. 

But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their 

owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head Percy discoursing (discuss) 

loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello.

 "I think that's them, Al," said Ginny suddenly. 

A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their 

faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.

 "Hi," said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. 

Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed (smile with joy) at 
him. 

"Parked all right, then?" Ron asked Harry. "I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a 
Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner."

 "No, I didn't," said Hermione, "I had complete faith in you." 

"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him," Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted 
Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. "I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I 
can use a Supersensory Charm for that." 

Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated 
discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts. 

 "If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you," said Ron, "but no pressure." 

 "Ron!" 

 Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. 

"He doesn't mean it," said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention.

��539ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned 

for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.

 "Look who it is." 

Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. 
His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled 
Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny 
staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. 

"So that's little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure you beat him in every test, 
Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains."

 "Ron, for heaven's sake," said Hermione, half stern, half amused. "Don't try to turn them against 
each other before they've even started school!" 

"You're right, sorry," said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, "Don't get too friendly 
with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood." 

"Hey!" James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was 
evidently bursting with news. 

"Teddy's back there," he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing 
clouds of steam. "Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging Victoire!"

 He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.

 "Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked Teddy what he was 

doing -" 

 "You interrupted them?" said Ginny. "You are so like Ron -" 

"-and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!" 
James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. 

"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!" whispered Lily ecstatically. "Teddy would really 
be part of the family then!" 

"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week," said Harry "Why don't we just 
invite him to live with us and have done with it?" 

"Yeah!" said James enthusiastically. "I don't mind sharing with Al. Teddy could have my 
room!" 

"No," said Harry firmly, "you and Al will share a room only when I want the house

demolished."

 He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's.

 "It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board."

 "Don't forget to give Neville our love!" Ginny told James as she hugged him.

 "Mum! I can't give a professor love!"

 "But you know Neville -" 

 James rolled his eyes. 

"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology 
and give him love." 

Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus. 
"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals." 

 "I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!" 

But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then 
leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his 
friends. 

"Thestrals are nothing to worry about," Harry told Albus. "They're gentle things, there's nothing 
scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the 
boats."

 Ginny kissed Albus good-bye.

 "See you at Christmas." 

"Bye, Al," said Harry as his son hugged him. "Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next 
Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And don't let James 

wind you up." 

 "What if I'm in Slytherin?" 

The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could 
have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. 

Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three 
children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. 

"Ablus Severus," Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful 
enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, "you were named for two

��541ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever 

knew." 

 "But just say -" 

"-then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, 

Al. But if it matters to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat 

takes your choice into account."

 "Really?"

 "It did for me," said Harry. 

He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when 
he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of 
parents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the 
carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest 
them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. 

"Why are they all staring?" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other 
students.

 "Don't let it worry you," said Ron. "It's me, I'm extremely famous." 

Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. 

The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already 
ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little 
bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. 

The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand 
was still raised in farewell. 

"He'll be alright," murmured Ginny. 

As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on 

his forehead. "I know he will." 

The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. 

All was well.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 
By 

J. K. Rowling 
Oh, the torment bred in the race, 
the grinding scream of death


 

and the stroke that hits the vein, 
the haemorrhage none can staunch, the grief, 
the curse no man can bear. 


But there is a cure in the house 
and not outside it, no, 
not from others but from them, 

their bloody strife. We sing to you, 
dark gods beneath the earth. 
Now hear, you blissful powers underground - 

answer the call, send help. 
Bless the children, give them Triumph now. 

Aeschylus, The Libation Bearers 


Death is but crossing the world, as friends do the seas; they live in one another still. 
For they must needs be present, that love and live in that which is omnipresent. 
In this divine glass they see face to face; and their converse is free, as well as pure. 
This is the comfort of friends, that though they may be said to die, yet their friendship and 


society are, in the best sense, ever present, because immortal. 

William Penn, from More Fruits of Solitude

Chapter One 

The Dark Lord Ascending 

The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the 
narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands 
directed at each other's chests; then, recognizing each other, they 
stowed (put away, store) their wands beneath their cloaks and 
started walking briskly in the same direction. 

"News?" asked the taller of the two. 

"The best," replied Severus Snape. 

The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles (thorny bush), on the right by 
a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they 
marched. 

"Thought I might be late," said Yaxley, his blunt features (��ƽ������ /��� vs. sharp features 
[������ brutish�����ݣ��� chapter 12, p283]) sliding in and out of sight as the branches of 
overhanging trees broke the moonlight. "It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will 
be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?" 

Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the 
lane. The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of imposing 
wrought-iron gates barring the men's way. Neither of them broke step. In silence both raised their 
left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal was smoke. 

The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men's footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to 
their right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his companion's head, but the source of 
the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top 
of the hedge. 

��He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks ...�� Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak 
with a snort. 

A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights 
glinting in the diamond [���� ] paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond 
the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped

��3ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it. 

The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet 
covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the wall followed Snape 
and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next 
room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle. 

The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room��s usual 
furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire 
beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece��¯̨ surmounted (be on top of) by a gilded mirror. 
Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the 
lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently 
unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended 
by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table 
below. None of the people seated underneath this singular sight were looking at it except for a pale 
young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing 
upward every minute or so. 

 ��Yaxley. Snape,�� said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. ��You are very nearly late.�� 

The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the 
new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette���� . As they drew nearer, however, his face 
shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose 
pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow. 

��Severus, here,�� said Voldemort, indicating the seat on his immediate right. ��Yaxley �C beside 
Dolohov.��

 The two men took their allotted places. Most of the eyes around the table followed Snape, and it 
was to him that Voldemort spoke first. 

 ��So?�� 

��My Lord, the Order of the Phoenix intends to move Harry Potter from his current place of 
safety on Saturday next, at nightfall.�� 

The interest around the table sharpened palpably: Some stiffened, others fidgeted, all gazing at 
Snape and Voldemort. 

��Saturday ... at nightfall,�� repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon Snape��s black ones

��4ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves 
would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into 
Voldemort��s face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort��s lipless mouth curved into something 
like a smile.

 ��Good. Very good. And this information comes �C��

 ���C from the source we discussed,�� said Snape. 

 ��My Lord.�� 

Yaxley had leaned forward to look down the long table at Voldemort and Snape. All faces 
turned to him.

 ��My Lord, I have heard differently.�� 

Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, ��Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that 

Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen.��

 Snape was smiling. 

��My source told me that there are plans to lay a false trail; this must be it. No doubt a 

Confundus Charm has been placed upon Dawlish. It would not be the first time; he is known to be 

susceptible.��

 ��I assure you, my Lord, Dawlish seemed quite certain,�� said Yaxley. 

��If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain,�� said Snape. ��I assure you, Yaxley, the 
Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we 
have infiltrated the Ministry.�� 

��The Order��s got one thing right, then, eh?�� said a squat man sitting a short distance from 
Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there����;���� along the table. 

Voldemort did not laugh. His gaze had wandered upward to the body revolving slowly 
overhead, and he seemed to be lost in thought. 

��My Lord,�� Yaxley went on, ��Dawlish believes an entire party of Aurors will be used to 
transfer the boy �C�� 

Voldemort held up a large white hand, and Yaxley subsided at once, watching resentfully as 
Voldemort turned back to Snape.

 ��Where are they going to hide the boy next?�� 

��At the home of one of the Order,�� said Snape. ��The place, according to the source, has been

��5ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little 
chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before 
next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the 
enchantments to break through the rest.�� 

��Well, Yaxley?�� Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely in his red 

eyes. ��Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?��

 Once again, all heads turned. Yaxley squared his shoulders. 

��My Lord, I have good news on that score. I have �C with difficulty, and after great effort �C 
succeeded in placing an Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse.�� 

Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a 
long, twisted face, clapped him on the back. 

��It is a start,�� said Voldemort. ��But Thicknesse is only one man. Scrimgeour must be 
surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister��s life will set me back a 
long way.�� 

��Yes �C my Lord, that is true �C but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the 
Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-
ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to 
bring Scrimgeour down.�� 

��As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest,�� said 
Voldemort. ��At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If 
we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels.�� 

��We are at an advantage there, my Lord,�� said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some 
portion of approval. ��We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical 
Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately.�� 

��He will not do either,�� said Snape. ��The Order is eschewing any form of transport that is 

controlled or regulated by the Ministry; they mistrust everything to do with the place.��

 ��All the better,�� said Voldemort. ��He will have to move in the open. Easier to take, by far.�� 

Again, Voldemort looked up at the slowly revolving body as he went on, ��I shall attend to the 

boy in person. There have been too many mistakes where Harry Potter is concerned. Some of them

��6ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

have been my own. That Potter lives is due more to my errors than to his triumphs.�� 

The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her 
expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter��s continued existence. Voldemort, 
however, seemed to be speaking more to himself than to any of them, still addressing the 
unconscious body above him. 

��I have been careless, and so have been thwarted by luck and chance, those wreckers of all but
���� the best-laid plans. But I know better now. I understand those things that I did not 
understand before. I must be the one to kill Harry Potter, and I shall be.��

 At these words, seemingly in response to them, a sudden wail sounded, a terrible, drawn-out cry 
of misery and pain. Many of those at the table looked downward, startled, for the sound had 
seemed to issue from below their feet. 

��Wormtail,�� said Voldemort, with no change in his quiet, thoughtful tone, and without 
removing his eyes from the revolving body above, ��have I not spoken to you about keeping our 
prisoner quiet?�� 

��Yes, m-my Lord,�� gasped a small man halfway down the table, who had been sitting so low in 
his chair that it appeared, at first glance, to be unoccupied. Now he scrambled from his seat and 
scurried from the room, leaving nothing behind him but a curious gleam of silver. 

��As I was saying,�� continued Voldemort, looking again at the tense faces of his followers, ��I 
understand better now. I shall need, for instance, to borrow a wand from one of you before I go to 
kill Potter.�� 

The faces around him displayed nothing but shock; he might have announced that he wanted to 
borrow one of their arms. 

��No volunteers?�� said Voldemort. ��Let��s see ... Lucius, I see no reason for you to have a wand 
anymore.�� 

Lucius Malfoy looked up. His skin appeared yellowish and waxy in the firelight, and his eyes 
were sunken and shadowed. When he spoke, his voice was hoarse.

 ��My Lord?��

 ��Your wand, Lucius. I require your wand.��

 ��I ...�� 

Malfoy glanced sideways at his wife. She was staring straight ahead, quite as pale as he was,

��7ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

her long blonde hair hanging down her back, but beneath the table her slim fingers closed briefly 
on his wrist. At her touch, Malfoy put his hand into his robes, withdrew a wand, and passed it 
along to Voldemort, who held it up in front of his red eyes, examining it closely.

 ��What is it?��

 ��Elm, my Lord,�� whispered Malfoy.

 ��And the core?��

 ��Dragon �C dragon heartstring.�� 

��Good,�� said Voldemort. He drew out his wand and compared the lengths. Lucius Malfoy made 
an involuntary movement; for a fraction of a second, it seemed he expected to receive Voldemort��s 
wand in exchange for his own. The gesture was not missed by Voldemort, whose eyes widened 
maliciously.

 ��Give you my wand, Lucius? My wand?��

 Some of the throng sniggered. 

��I have given you your liberty, Lucius, is that not enough for you? But I have noticed that you 
and your family seem less than happy of late ... What is it about my presence in your home that 

displeases you, Lucius?��

 ��Nothing �C nothing, my Lord!��

 ��Such lies, Lucius ... �� 

The soft voice seemed to hiss on even after the cruel mouth had stopped moving. One or two of 
the wizards barely repressed a shudder as the hissing grew louder; something heavy could be heard 
sliding across the floor beneath the table. 

The huge snake emerged to climb slowly up Voldemort��s chair. It rose, seemingly endlessly, 
and came to rest across Voldemort��s shoulders: its neck the thickness of a man��s thigh; its eyes, 
with their vertical slits for pupils, unblinking. Voldemort stroked the creature absently with long 
thin fingers, still looking at Lucius Malfoy. 

��Why do the Malfoys look so unhappy with their lot (fate, destiny)? Is my return, my rise to 
power, not the very thing they professed to desire for so many years?�� 

��Of course, my Lord,�� said Lucius Malfoy. His hand shook as he wiped sweat from his upper 
lip. ��We did desire it �C we do.�� 

To Malfoy��s left, his wife made an odd, stiff nod, her eyes averted from Voldemort and the

��8ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

snake. To his right, his son, Draco, who had been gazing up at the inert body overhead, glanced 
quickly at Voldemort and away again, terrified to make eye contact. 

��My Lord,�� said a dark woman halfway down the table, her voice constricted with emotion, ��it 
is an honor to have you here, in our family��s house. There can be no higher pleasure.�� 

She sat beside her sister, as unlike her in looks, with her dark hair and heavily lidded eyes, as 
she was in bearing and demeanor; where Narcissa sat rigid and impassive, Bellatrix leaned toward 
Voldemort, for mere words could not demonstrate her longing for closeness. 

��No higher pleasure,�� repeated Voldemort, his head tilted a little to one side as he considered 

Bellatrix. ��That means a great deal, Bellatrix, from you.��

 Her face flooded with color; her eyes welled with tears of delight.

 ��My Lord knows I speak nothing but the truth!�� 

��No higher pleasure ... even compared with the happy event that, I hear, has taken place in your 

family this week?��

 She stared at him, her lips parted, evidently confused. 

 ��I don��t know what you mean, my Lord.�� 

��I��m talking about your niece, Bellatrix. And yours, Lucius and Narcissa. She has just married 

the werewolf, Remus Lupin. You must be so proud.�� 

There was an eruption of jeering laughter from around the table. Many leaned forward to 
exchange gleeful looks; a few thumped the table with their fists. The giant snake, disliking the 
disturbance, opened its mouth wide and hissed angrily, but the Death Eaters did not hear it, so 
jubilant were they at Bellatrix and the Malfoys�� humiliation. Bellatrix��s face, so recently flushed 
wit happiness, had turned an ugly, blotchy red. 

��She is no niece of ours, my Lord,�� she cried over the outpouring of mirth. ��We �C Narcissa and 
I �C have never set eyes on our sister since she married the Mudblood. This brat has nothing to do 
with either of us, nor any beast she marries.�� 

��What say you, Draco?�� asked Voldemort, and though his voice was quiet, it carried clearly 
through the catcalls and jeers. ��Will you babysit the cubs?�� 

The hilarity mounted; Draco Malfoy looked in terror at his father, who was staring down into 
his own lap, then caught his mother��s eye. She shook her head almost imperceptibly, then resumed 
her own deadpan (expressionless) stare at the opposite wall.

��9ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Enough,�� said Voldemort, stroking the angry snake. ��Enough.��

 And the laughter died at once. 

��Many of our oldest family trees become a little diseased over time,�� he said as Bellatrix gazed 
at him, breathless and imploring, ��You must prune�޼�֦ yours, must you not, to keep it 
healthy? Cut away those parts that threaten the health of the rest.�� 

��Yes, my Lord,�� whispered Bellatrix, and her eyes swam with tears of gratitude again. ��At the 
first chance!�� 

��You shall have it,�� said Voldemort. ��And in your family, so in the world ... we shall cut away 
the canker����;����that infects us until only those of the true blood remain ...�� 

Voldemort raised Lucius Malfoy��s wand, pointed it directly at the slowly revolving figure 
suspended over the table, and gave it a tiny flick. The figure came to life with a groan and began to 
struggle against invisible bonds. 

 ��Do you recognize our guest, Severus?�� asked Voldemort. 

Snape raised his eyes to the upside down face. All of the Death Eaters were looking up at the 
captive now, as though they had been given permission to show curiosity. As she revolved to face 
the firelight, the woman said in a cracked and terrified voice, ��Severus! Help me!��

 ��Ah, yes,�� said Snape as the prisoner turned slowly away again. 

��And you, Draco?�� asked Voldemort, stroking the snake��s snout with his wand-free hand. 
Draco shook his head jerkily. Now that the woman had woken, he seemed unable to look at her 
anymore. 

��But you would not have taken her classes,�� said Voldemort. ��For those of you who do not 
know, we are joined here tonight by Charity Burbage who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.�� 

There were small noises of comprehension around the table. A broad, hunched woman with 
pointed teeth cackled. 

��Yes ... Professor Burbage taught the children of witches and wizards all about Muggles ... how 
they are not so different from us ... ��

 One of the Death Eaters spat on the floor. Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape again.

 ��Severus ... please ... please ... �� 

��Silence,�� said Voldemort, with another twitch of Malfoy��s wand, and Charity fell silent as if

��10ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

gagged. ��Not content with corrupting and polluting the minds of Wizarding children, last week 
Professor Burbage wrote an impassioned defense of Mudbloods in the Daily Prophet. Wizards, she 
says, must accept these thieves of their knowledge and magic. The dwindling of the purebloods is, 
says Professor Burbage, a most desirable circumstance ... She would have us all mate with 
Muggles ... or, no doubt, werewolves ... �� 

Nobody laughed this time. There was no mistaking the anger and contempt in Voldemort��s 
voice. For the third time, Charity Burbage revolved to face Snape. Tears were pouring from her 
eyes into her hair. Snape looked back at her, quite impassive, as she turned slowly away from him 
again.

 ��Avada Kedavra�� 

The flash of green light illuminated every corner of the room. Charity fell, with a resounding 
crash, onto the table below, which trembled and creaked. Several of the Death Eaters leapt back in 
their chairs. Draco fell out of his onto the floor. 

��Dinner, Nagini,�� said Voldemort softly, and the great snake swayed and slithered from his 
shoulders onto the polished wood.

Chapter Two 
In Memorandum 

Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand 
swearing under his breath, he shouldered open 
door. There was a crunch of breaking china. He 
on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the 
his bedroom door. 
in his left and 
his bedroom 
had trodden 
floor outside 
"What the -?" 

He looked around, the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of 
tea was Dudley's idea of a clever booby trap���� . Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry 
scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already 
crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run 
his finger under the tap. 

It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to 
perform magic... but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have 
defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came to think of it �C 
particularly in light of his immediate plans �C this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. 
Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop 
up as much of the tea as he could before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind 
him. 

Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he 
had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed 
off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced��...�Ż� or updated them, leaving a 
layer of general debris at the bottom �C old quills, desiccated (dry up,) beetle eyes, single socks that 
no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch������ , experienced 
a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood. 

He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped

��12ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT 
CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold 
locket inside which a note signed R.A.B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge 
that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment of the 
enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt 
cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather's last gift 
except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering gritɰ��. 

Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his 
own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning's 
Daily prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter 
memories -the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned by 
attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk. 

It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items, and sort the 
remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. His school and 
Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to 
be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of 
night, probably, as if they were evidence of some dreadful crime. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility 
Cloak, potion-making kit������ , certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, 
a stack of letters, and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the 
Marauder's Map and the locket with the note signed R.A.B. inside it. The locket was accorded this 
place of honor not because it was valuable �C in all usual senses it was worthless �C but because of 
what it had cost to attain it. 

This left a sizable stack of newspapers sitting on his desk beside his snowy owl, Hedwig, one 
for each of the days Harry had spent at Privet Drive this summer. 

He got up off the floor, stretched, and moved across to his desk. Hedwig made no movement as 
he began to flick through newspapers, throwing them into the rubbish pile one by one. The owl 
was asleep or else faking; she was angry with Harry about the limited amount of time she was 
allowed out of her cage at the moment.

��13ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

As he neared the bottom of the pile of newspapers, Harry slowed down, searching for one 
particular issue that he knew had arrived shortly after he had returned to Privet Drive for the 
summer; he remembered that there had been a small mention on the front about the resignation of 
Charity Burbage, the Muggle Studies teacher at Hogwarts. At last he found it. Turning to page ten, 
he sank into his desk chair and reread the article he had been looking for. 

ALBUS DUMBLEDORE REMEMBERED 

By Elphias Doge 

I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual 
attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. I had 
contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was no longer 
contagious, my pock-marked���� visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to 
approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted 
notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage 
and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles. 

Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had 
committed this crime; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured 
me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the 
sad business, though many attempted to make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to��inclined to, willing to�� praise his father's action and assumed that Albus too was a 
Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mistaken. As anybody who knew Albus 
would attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, his determined 
support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years. 

In a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. 
By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, 
but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of 
us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example, not to mention his 
help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me later in 
life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.

��14ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular 
correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, 
the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the 
magical theoretician���ۼ� . Several of his papers found their way into learned 
publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical 
Potioneer. Dumbledore's future career seemed likely to be meteoric��fast and brilliant��, 
and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister of Magic. 
Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job, 
however, he never had Ministerial ambitions. 

Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus's brother, Aberforth, arrived at 
school. They were not alike: Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to 
settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite 
wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along as 
comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be 
admitted that living in Albus's shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable 
experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and 
cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother. 

When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then-traditional tour of the 
world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate 
careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, 
died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my 
departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra's funeral, then left for what was now 
to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to 
them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me. 

That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, describing, 
perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in 
Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his day-
to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in 
my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward the end of my year's travels,

��15ҳ��

that another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana. 

Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so soon after 
the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of her brothers. All those closest to 
Albus �C and I count myself one of that lucky number �C agree that Ariana's death, and 
Albus's feeling of personal responsibility for it (though, of course, he was guiltless), left 
their mark upon him forevermore. 

I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person's 
suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less light-hearted. To add to his 
misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and 
Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would lift �C in later years they 
reestablished, if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial (friendly) one.) However, 
he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to 
mention them. 

Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore's 
innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery of 
the twelve uses of dragon's blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he 
displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They 
say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald 
in 1945. Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they 
watched these two extraordinary wizards to battle. Dumbledore's triumph and its 
consequences for the Wizarding world are considered a turning point in magical history to 
match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He Who 
Must Not Be Named. 

Albus Dumbledore was never proud or vain; he could find something to value in anyone, 
however apparently insignificant or wretched, and I believe that his early losses endowed 
him with great humanity and sympathy. I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but 
my loss is nothing compared to the Wizarding World's. That he was the most inspiring and 
best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question. He died as he lived, working 
always for the greater good and, to his last hour, as willing to stretch out a hand to a small

boy with dragon pox as he was on the day I met him. 

Harry finished reading, but continued to gaze at the picture accompanying the obituary. 
Dumbledore was wearing his familiar, kindly smile, but as he peered over the top of his half-moon 
spectacles, he gave the impression, even in newsprint, of X-raying Harry, whose sadness mingled 
with a sense of humiliation. 

He had thought he knew Dumbledore quite well, but ever since reading this obituary he had 
been forced to recognize that he had barely known him at all. Never once had he imagined 
Dumbledore's childhood or youth; it was as though he had sprung into being as Harry had known 
him, venerable and silver-haired and old. The idea of a teenage Dumbledore was simply odd, like 
trying to imagine a stupid Hermione or a friendly Blast-Ended Skrewt. 

He had never thought to ask Dumbledore about his past. No doubt it would have felt strange, 
impertinent even, but after all it had been common knowledge that Dumbledore had taken part in 
that legendary duel with Grindelwald, and Harry had not thought to ask Dumbledore what that had 
been like, nor about any of his other famous achievements. No, they had always discussed Harry, 
Harry's past, Harry's future, Harry's plans... and it seemed to Harry now, despite the fact that his 
future was so dangerous and so uncertain, that he had missed irreplaceable opportunities when he 
had failed to ask Dumbledore more about himself, even though the only personal question he had 
ever asked his headmaster was also the only one he suspected that Dumbledore had not answered 
honestly, 

"What do you see when you look in the mirror?" 

"I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks." 

After several minutes' thought, Harry tore the obituary out of the Prophet, folded it carefully, 
and tucked it inside the first volume of Practical Defensive Magic and its Use against the Dark 
Arts. Then he threw the rest of the newspaper onto the rubbish pile and turned to face the room. It 
was much tidier. The only things left out of place were today's Daily Prophet, still lying on the 
bed, and on top of it, the piece of broken mirror. 

Harry moved across the room, slid the mirror fragment off today's Prophet, and unfolded the 
newspaper. He had merely glanced at the headline when he had taken the rolled-up paper from the

��17ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

delivery owl early that morning and thrown it aside, after noting that it said nothing about 
Voldemort. Harry was sure that the Ministry was leaning on (depend on) the Prophet to suppress 
news about Voldemort. It was only now, therefore, that he saw what he had missed. 

Across the bottom half of the front page a smaller headline was set over a picture of 
Dumbledore striding along, looking harried, 

DUMBLEDORE �C THE TRUTH AT LAST? 

Coming next week, the shocking story of the flawed genius considered by many to be the 
greatest wizard of his generation. Stripping away the popular image of serene, silver-
bearded wisdom, Rita Skeeter reveals the disturbed childhood, the lawless youth, the lifelong 
feuds, and the guilty secrets that Dumbledore carried to his grave, WHY was the man 
tipped to be the Minister of Magic content to remain a mere headmaster? WHAT was the 
real purpose of the secret organization known as the Order of the Phoenix? HOW did 
Dumbledore really meet his end? 

The answers to these and many more questions are explored in the explosive new biography, 
The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, by Rita Skeeter, exclusively interviewed by Berry 
Braithwaite, page 13, inside. 

Harry ripped open the paper and found page thirteen. The article was topped with a picture 
showing another familiar face, a woman wearing jeweled glasses with elaborately curled blonde 
hair, her teeth bared in what was clearly supposed to be a winning smile, wiggling her fingers up at 
him. Doing his best to ignore this nauseating image, Harry read on. 

In person, Rita Skeeter is much warmer and softer than her famously ferocious quill-
portraits might suggest. Greeting me in the hallway of her cozy home, she leads me 
straight into the kitchen for a cup of tea, a slice of pound cake and, it goes without saying, 
a steaming vat of freshest gossip. 

"Well, of course, Dumbledore is a biographer's dream," says Skeeter. "Such a long, full 
life. I'm sure my book will be the first of very, very many." 

Skeeter was certainly quick off the mark. Her nine-hundred-page book was completed in 
a mere four weeks after Dumbledore's mysterious death in June. I ask her how she

��18ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

managed this superfast feat. 

"Oh, when you've been a journalist as long as I have, working to a deadline is second 

nature. I knew that the Wizarding world was clamoring for the full story and I wanted to be 

the first to meet that need." 

I mention the recent, widely publicized remarks of Elphias Doge, Special Advisor to the 

Wizengamot and longstanding friend of Albus Dumbledore's, that "Skeeter's book contains 

less fact than a Chocolate Frog card." 

Skeeter throws back her head and laughs. 

"Darling Dodgy! I remember interviewing him a few years back about merpeople rights, 

bless him. Completely gaga (fool, senile person), seemed to think we were sitting at the 

bottom of Lake Windermere, kept telling me to watch out for trout." 

And yet Elphias Doge's accusations of inaccuracy have been echoed in many places. 

Does Skeeter really feel that four short weeks have been enough to gain a full picture of 

Dumbledore's long and extraordinary life? 

"Oh, my dear," beams Skeeter, rapping me affectionately across the knuckles (rap across 
the knuckles �C���� ), "you know as well as I do how much information can be generated 
by a fat bag of Galleons, a refusal to hear the word 'no,' and a nice sharp Quick-Quotes 
Quill! People were queuing to dish the dirt on Dumbledore anyway. Not everyone thought 
he was so wonderful, you know �C he trod on an awful lot of important toes. But old Dodgy 
Doge can get off his high hippogriff, because I've had access to a source most journalists 
would swap their wands for, one who has never spoken in public before and who was close 
to Dumbledore during the most turbulent and disturbing phase of his youth." 

The advance publicity for Skeeter's biography has certainly suggested that there will be 

shocks in store for those who believe Dumbledore to have led a blameless life. What were 

the biggest surprises she uncovered, I ask? 

"Now, come off it. Betty, I'm not giving away all the highlights before anybody's bought 

the book!" laughs Skeeter. "But I can promise that anybody who still thinks Dumbledore 

was white as his beard is in for a rude awakening! Let's just say that nobody hearing him

rage against You-Know-Who would have dreamed that he dabbled���� ;ǳ�� in the Dark 
Arts himself in his youth! And for a wizard who spent his later years pleading for 
tolerance, he wasn't exactly broad-minded when he was younger! Yes, Albus Dumbledore 
had an extremely murky past, not to mention that very fishy family, which he worked so 
hard to keep hushed up." 

I ask whether Skeeter is referring to Dumbledore's brother, Aberforth, whose conviction 
by the Wizengamot for misuse of magic caused a minor scandal fifteen years ago. 

"Oh, Aberforth is just the tip of the dung heap,�� laughs Skeeter. "No, no, I'm talking 
about much worse than a brother with a fondness for fiddling about with goats, worse even 
than the Muggle-maiming father �C Dumbledore couldn't keep either of them quiet anyway, 
they were both charged by the Wizengamot. No, it's the mother and the sister that intrigued 
me, and a little digging uncovered a positive nest of nastiness �C but, as I say, you'll have to 
wait for chapters nine to twelve for full details. All I can say now is, it's no wonder 
Dumbledore never talked about how his nose got broken." 

Family skeletons notwithstanding, does Skeeter deny the brilliance that led to 
Dumbledore's many magical discoveries? 

"He had brains," she concedes, "although many now question whether he could really 
take full credit for all of his supposed achievements. As I reveal in chapter sixteen, Ivor 
Dillonsby claims he had already discovered eight uses of dragon's blood when 
Dumbledore 'borrowed' his papers." 

But the importance of some of Dumbledore's achievements cannot, I venture, be denied. 
What of his famous defeat of Grindelwald? 

"Oh, now, I'm glad you mentioned Grindelwald," says Skeeter with such a tantalizing 
smile. "I'm afraid those who go dewy-eyed over Dumbledore's spectacular victory must 
brace themselves for a bombshell �C or perhaps a Dungbomb. Very dirty business indeed. 
All I'll say is, don't be so sure that there really was a spectacular duel of legend. After 
they've read my book, people may be forced to conclude that Grindelwald simply conjured 
a white handkerchief from the end of his wand and came quietly!"

��20ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Skeeter refuses to give any more away on this intriguing subject, so we turn instead to 
the relationship that will undoubtedly fascinate her readers more than any other. 

"Oh yes," says Skeeter, nodding briskly, "I devote an entire chapter to the whole Potter-
Dumbledore relationship. It's been called unhealthy, even sinister. Again, your readers will 
have to buy my book for the whole story, but there is no question that Dumbledore took an 
unnatural interest in Potter from the word go��һ��ʼ . Whether that was really in the 
boy's best interests �C well, we'll see. It's certainly an open secret that Potter has had a most 
troubled adolescence." 

I ask whether Skeeter is still in touch with Harry Potter, whom she so famously 
interviewed last year, a breakthrough piece in which Potter spoke exclusively of his 
conviction that You-Know-Who had returned. 

"Oh, yes, we've developed a closer bond," says Skeeter. "Poor Potter has few real 
friends, and we met at one of the most testing moments of his life �C the Triwizard 
Tournament. I am probably one of the only people alive who can say that they know the 
real Harry Potter." 

Which leads us neatly to the many rumors still circulating about Dumbledore's final 
hours. Does Skeeter believe that Potter was there when Dumbledore died? 

"Well, I don't want to say too much �C it's all in the book �C but eyewitnesses inside 
Hogwarts castle saw Potter running away from the scene moments after Dumbledore fell, 
jumped, or was pushed. Potter later gave evidence against Severus Snape, a man against 
whom he has a notorious grudge. Is everything as it seems? That is for the Wizarding 
community to decide �C once they've read my book." 

On that intriguing note, I take my leave. There can be no doubt that Skeeter has quilled an 

instant bestseller. Dumbledore's legion of admirers, meanwhile, may well be trembling at what is 

soon to emerge about their hero. 

Harry reached the bottom of the article, but continued to stare blankly at the page. Revulsion 

and fury rose in him like vomit; he balled up the newspaper and threw it, with all his force, at the 

wall, where it joined the rest of the rubbish heaped around his overflowing bin. 

��21ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He began to stride blindly around the room, opening empty drawers and picking up books only 
to replace them on the same piles, barely conscious of what he was doing, as random phrases from 
Rita's article echoed in his head, An entire chapter to the whole Potter-Dumbledore relationship ... 
It's been called unhealthy, even sinister ... He dabbled in the Dark Arts himself in his youth ... I've 
had access to a source most journalists would swap their wands for... 

"Lies!" Harry bellowed, and through the window he saw the next-door neighbor, who had 
paused to restart his lawn mower, look up nervously. 

Harry sat down hard on the bed. The broken bit of mirror danced away from him; he picked it 
up and turned it over in his fingers, thinking, thinking of Dumbledore and the lies with which Rita 
Skeeter was defaming him. 

A flash of brightest blue. Harry froze, his cut finger slipping on the jagged edge of the mirror 
again. He had imagined it, he must have done. He glanced over his shoulder, but the wall was a 
sickly peach color of Aunt Petunia's choosing. There was nothing blue there for the mirror to 
reflect. He peered into the mirror fragment again, and saw nothing but his own bright green eye 
looking back at him. 

He had imagined it, there was no other explanation; imagined it, because he had been thinking 
of his dead headmaster. If anything was certain, it was that the bright blue eyes of Albus 
Dumbledore would never pierce him again.

Chapter Three 

The Dursleys Departing 

The sound of the front door slamming echoed 


up the stairs 
and a voice roared, ��Oi! You!�� 
Sixteen years of being addressed thus left 

Harry in no 
doubt whom his uncle was calling, nevertheless, 

he did not 
immediately respond. He was still gazing at the 

mirror 
fragment in which, for a split second, he had 

thought he 

saw Dumbledore��s eye. It was not until his uncle bellowed, "BOY!" that Harry got slowly to his 
feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack 
filled with things he would be taking with him. 

��You took you time!�� roared Vernon Dursley when Harry appeared at the top of the stairs, ��Get 
down here. I want a word!�� 

Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans' pockets. When he reached the living room 
he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for traveling; Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up 
jacket, Aunt Petunia in a neat salmon-colored coat and Dudley, Harry��s large, blond, muscular 
cousin, in his leather jacket.

 ��Yes?�� asked Harry. 

��Sit down!�� said Uncle Vernon. Harry raised his eyebrows. ��Please!�� added Uncle Vernon, 
wincing slightly as though the word was sharp in his throat. 

Harry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt 
Petunia and Dudley, following his movement with anxious expressions. Finally, his large purple 
face crumpled with concentration. Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke. 

"I've changed my mind,�� he said. 

"What a surprise," said Harry. 

"Don't you take that tone��" began Aunt Petunia in a shrill voice, but Vernon Dursley waved 
her down. 

"It's all a lot of claptrap (nonsense),�� said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy little eyes. 
"I've decided I don't believe a word of it. We��re staying put, we��re not going anywhere.��

��23ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. Vernon Dursley 
had been changing his mind every twenty four hours for the past four weeks, packing and 
unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry��s favorite moment had been the 
one when Uncle Vernon, unaware the Dudley had added his dumbbells���� to his case since the 
last time it been repacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot (British) luggage 
compartment of a car) and collapsed with a yelp of pain and much swearing. 

��According to you,�� Vernon Dursley said, now resuming his pacing up and down the living 

room, ��we �C Petunia, Dudley and I �C are in danger. From �C from �C�� 

��Some of 'my lot' right?�� said Harry 

��Well, I don��t believe it,�� repeated Uncle Vernon, coming to a halt in front of Harry again. "I 

was awake half the night thinking it all over, and I believe it's a plot to get the house." 

"The house?" repeated Harry. "What house?" 

"This house!" shrieked Uncle Vernon, the vein his forehead starting to pulse. "Our house! 
House prices are skyrocketing around here! You want us out of the way and then you're going to 
do a bit of hocus pocus and before we know it the deeds will be in your name and �C" 

��Are you out of your mind?" demanded Harry. "A plot to get this house? Are you actually as 
stupid as you look?" 

"Don't you dare -!" squealed Aunt Petunia, but again Vernon waved her down. Slights on his 
personal appearance were, it seemed, as nothing to the danger he had spotted. 

"Just in case you've forgotten," said Harry, "I've already got a house, my godfather left me one. 
So why would I want this one? All the happy memories?" 

There was silence. 

Harry thought he had rather impressed his uncle with this argument. 

"You claim," said Uncle Vernon, starting to pace yet again, "that this Lord Thing �C" 

"-Voldemort," said Harry impatiently, "and we've been through this about a hundred times 
already. This isn't a claim, it's fact. Dumbledore told you last year, and Kingsley and Mr. Weasley 
�C" 

Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his uncle was attempting 
to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry's summer holidays, of 
two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley

��24ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

had come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys. Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr. 
Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been 
expected to delight Uncle Vernon. 

"-Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well," Harry pressed on remorselessly, "Once 
I'm seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as 
me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I 
am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I'd come and try to rescue you." 

Uncle Vernon's and Harry's eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant they were both 
wondering the same thing. 

Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, "You've got to go into hiding and the Order 
wants to help. You're being offered serious protection, the best there is." 

Uncle Vernon said nothing but continued to pace up and down. Outside the sun hung low over 
the privet hedges. The next door neighbor's lawn mower stalledϨ�� again. 

"I thought there was a Ministry of Magic?" asked Vernon Dursley abruptly. 

"There is," said Harry, surprised. 

"Well, then, why can't they protect us? It seems to me that, as innocent victims, guilty of nothing 
more than harboring a marked man, we ought to qualify for government protection!" 

Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in 
the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted. 

"You heard what Mr. Weasley and Kingsley said," Harry replied. "We think the Ministry has 
been infiltrated." 

Uncle Vernon strode back to the fireplace and back breathing so strongly that his great black 
mustache rippled his face still purple with concentration. 

"All right," he said. Stopping in front of Harry get again. "All right, let's say for the sake of 
argument we accept this protection. I still don't see why we can't have that Kingsley bloke." 

Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had also been addressed 
half a dozen times. 

"As I've told you," he said through gritted teeth, "Kingsley is protecting the Mug �C I mean, your 
Prime Minister." 

"Exactly �C he's the best!" said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank television screen. The

��25ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime 
Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of 
dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had 
caused the Dursleys to take to (like) Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any 
other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with earring in. 

"Well, he's taken,�� said Harry. "But Hestia Jones and Dedalus Diggle are more than up to the 
job �C" 

"If we'd even seen CVs (Curriculum Vitae -���˼��� ) ...�� began Uncle Vernon, but Harry lost 
patience. 

Getting to his feet, he advanced on his uncle, now pointing at the TV set himself. 

"These accidents aren't accidents �C the crashed and explosions and derailments and whatever 
else has happened since we last watched the news. People are disappearing and dying and he's 
behind it �C Voldemort. I've told you this over and over again, he kills Muggles for fun. Even the 
fogs �C they're caused by dementors, and if you can't remember what they are, ask your son!" 

Dudley's hands jerked upward to cover his mouth. With his parents' and Harry's eyes upon him, 
he slowly lowered them again and asked, "There are... more of them?" 

"More?" laughed Harry. "More than the two that attacked us, you mean? Of course there are, 
there are hundreds, maybe thousands by this time, seeing as they feed��send�� off fear and 
despair -" 

"All right, all right," blustered Vernon Dursley. "You've made your point �C" 

"I hope so," said Harry, "because once I'm seventeen, all of them �C Death Eaters, dementors, 
maybe even Inferi �C which means dead bodies enchanted by a Dark wizard �C will be able to find 
you and will certainly attack you. And if you remember the last time you tried to outrun wizards, I 
think you'll agree you need help." 

There was a brief silence in which the distant echo of Hagrid smashing down a wooden front 
door seemed to reverberate through the intervening years. Aunt Petunia was looking at Uncle 
Vernon; Dudley was staring at Harry. Finally Uncle Vernon blurted out, "But what about my 
work? What about Dudley's school? I don't suppose those things matter to a bunch of layabout 
(idler, bum) wizards �C" 

"Don't you understand?" shouted Harry. "They will torture and kill you like they did my

parents!" 

"Dad," said Dudley in a loud voice, "Dad �C I'm going with these Order people." 

"Dudley," said Harry, "for the first time in your life, you're talking sense." 

He knew the battle was won. If Dudley was frightened enough to accept the Order's help, his 
parents would accompany him. There could be no question of being separated from their 
Duddykins. Harry glanced at the carriage clock on the mantelpiece. 

"They'll be here in about five minutes,�� he said, and when none of the Dursleys replied, he left 
the room. The prospect of parting �C probably forever �C from his aunt, uncle and cousin was one 
that he was able to contemplate quite cheerfully but there was nevertheless a certain awkwardness 
in the air. What did you say to one another at the end of sixteen years' solid dislike? 

Back in his bedroom, Harry fiddled aimlessly with his rucksack then poked a couple of owl nuts 

through the bars of Hedwig's cage. They fell with dull thuds to the bottom where she ignored them. 

"We're leaving soon, really soon," Harry told her. "And then you'll be able to fly again." 

The doorbell rang. Harry hesitated, then headed back out of his room and downstairs. It was too 
much to expect Hestia and Dedalus to cope with the Dursleys on their own. 

"Harry Potter!" squeaked an excited voice, the moment Harry had opened the door; a small man 
in a mauve [m.uv]����ɫ�� top hat that was sweeping him a deep bow. "An honor as ever!" 

"Thanks, Dedalus," said Harry, bestowing a small and embarrassed smile upon the dark haired 
Hestia. "It's really good of you to do this... They're through here, my aunt and uncle and cousin...�� 

"Good day to you, Harry Potter's relatives!" said Dedalus happily striding into the living room. 
The Dursleys did not look at all happy to be addressed thus; Harry half expected another change of 
mind. Dudley shrank neared to his mother at the sight of the witch and wizard. 

"I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told you, is a simple one," 
said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. "We shall be 
leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic in your house �C Harry being still 
underage it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him �C we shall be driving, say, ten 
miles or so before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you. You know how to 
drive, I take it?" He asked Uncle Vernon politely. 

"Know how to �C? Of course I ruddy well know how to drive!" spluttered�����ܻ���˵ Uncle 
Vernon. 

��27ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Very clever of you, sir, very clever. I personally would be utterly bamboozled (confuse, 
bewilder) by all those buttons and knobs," said Dedalus. He was clearly under the impression that 
he was flattering Vernon Dursley, who was visibly losing confidence in the plan with every word 
Dedalus spoke. 

"Can't even drive," he muttered under his breath, his mustache rippling indignantly, but 
fortunately neither Dedalus nor Hestia seemed to hear him. 

"You, Harry," Dedalus continued, "will wait here for your guard. There has been a little change 
in the arrangements �C" 

��What d'you mean?" said Harry at once. "I thought Mad-Eye was going to come and take me by 
Side Along-Apparition?" 

"Can't do it," said Hestia tersely, "Mad-Eye will explain." 

The Dursleys, who had listened to all of this with looks of utter incomprehension on their faces, 
jumped as a loud voice screeched, "Hurry up!" Harry looked all around the room before realizing 
the voice had issued from Dedalus's pocket watch. 

"Quite right, we��re operating to a very tight schedule," said Dedalus nodding at his watch and 
tucking it back into his waist coat. "We are attempting to time your departure from the house with 
your family's Disapparition, Harry, thus the charm breaks the moment you all head for safety." He 
turned to the Dursleys, "Well, are we all packed and ready to go?" 

None of them answered him. Uncle Vernon was still staring appalled at the bulge in Dedalus's 
waistcoat pocket. 

"Perhaps we should wait outside in the hall, Dedalus," murmured Hestia. She clearly felt that it 
would be tactless for them to remain the room while Harry and the Dursleys exchanged loving, 
possibly tearful farewells. 

"There's no need," Harry muttered, but Uncle Vernon made any further explanation unnecessary 

by saying loudly, 

"Well, this is good-bye then, boy." 

He swung his right arm upward to shake Harry's hand, but at the last moment seemed unable to 
face it, and merely closed his fist and began swinging it backward and forward like a metronome��
����. 

"Ready, Duddy?" asked Petunia, fussily checking the clasp of her handbag so as to avoid

��28ҳ��

looking at Harry altogether. 

Dudley did not answer but stood there with his mouth slightly ajar, reminding Harry a little of 
the giant, Grawp. 

"Come along, then," said Uncle Vernon. 

He had already reached the living room door when Dudley mumbled, "I don't understand." 

"What don't you understand, popkin?" asked Petunia looking up at her son. 

Dudley raised a large, hamlike hand to point at Harry. 

"Why isn't he coming with us? 

Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia froze when they stood staring at Dudley as though he had just 

expressed a desire to become a ballerina. 

"What?" said Uncle Vernon loudly. 

"Why isn't he coming too?" asked Dudley. 

"Well, he -doesn't want to," said Uncle Vernon, turning to glare at Harry and adding, "You 
don't want to, do you?" 

"Not in the slightest," said Harry. 

"There you are�ⲻ����," Uncle Vernon told Dudley. "Now come on we're off." 

He marched out of the room. They heard the front door open, but Dudley did not move and after 
a few faltering steps Aunt Petunia stopped too. 

"What now?" barked Uncle Vernon, reappearing in the doorway. 

It seemed that Dudley was struggling with concepts too difficult to put into words. After several 
moments of apparently painful internal struggle he said, "But where's he going to go?" 

Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon looked at each other. It was clear that Dudley was frightening 
them. 

Hestia Jones broke the silence. "But... surely you know where your nephew is going?" she asked 
looking bewildered. 

"Certainly we know," said Vernon Dursley. "He's off with some of your lot, isn't he? Right, 
Dudley, let's get in the car, you heard the man, we're in a hurry.�� 

Again, Vernon Dursley marched as far as the front door, but Dudley did not follow. 

"Off with some of our lot?" Hestia looked outraged. 

Harry had met this attitude before. Witches and wizards seemed stunned that his close living

��29ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

relatives took so little interest in the famous Harry Potter. 

"It's fine," Harry assured her. "It doesn't matter, honestly." 

"Doesn't matter?" repeated Hestia, her voice rising considerably. "Don't these people realize 

what you've been through? What danger you are in? The unique position you hold in the hearts of 

the anti-Voldemort movement?" 

"Er �Cno, they don't," said Harry. "They think I'm a waste of space, actually but I'm used to �C" 

"I don't think you're a waste of space (person who is stupid or useless)." 

If Harry had not seen Dudley's lips move, he might not have believed it. As it was, he stared at 

Dudley for several seconds before accepting that it must have been his cousin who had spoken; for 

one thing, Dudley had turned red. 

Harry was embarrassed and astonished himself. "Well... er... thanks, Dudley." 

Again, Dudley appeared to grapple with thoughts too unwieldy (heavy, awkward) for expression 

before mumbling, "You saved my life," 

"Not really," said Harry. "It was your soul the dementor would have taken...�� 

He looked curiously at his cousin. They had had virtually no contact during this summer or last, 
as Harry had come back to Privet Drive so briefly and kept to his room so much. It now dawned on 
(begin to understand) Harry, however, that the cup of cold tea on which he had trodden that 
morning might not have been a booby trap at all. 

Although rather touched, he was nevertheless quite relieved that Dudley appeared to have 
exhausted his ability to express his feelings. After opening his mouth once or twice more, Dudley 
subsided into scarlet-faced silence. 

Aunt Petunia burst into tears. Hestia Jones gave her an approving look that changed to outrage 
as Aunt Petunia ran forward and embraced Dudley rather than Harry. 

"S-so sweet, Dudders...�� she sobbed into his massive chest. "S-such a lovely b-boy... s-saying 
thank you...�� 

"But he hasn't said thank you at all!" said Hestia indignantly. "He only said he didn't think Harry 
was a waste of space!" 

"Yeah, but coming from Dudley that's like 'I love you,'" said Harry, torn between annoyance and 
a desire to laugh as Aunt Petunia continued to clutch at Dudley as if he had just saved Harry from 
a burning building.

"Are we going or not?" roared Uncle Vernon, reappearing yet again at the living room door. "I 
thought we were on a tight schedule!" 

"Yes �C yes, we are," said Dedalus Diggle, who had been watching these exchanged with an air 
of bemusement and now seemed to pull himself together. "We really must be off. Harry -" 

He tripped������ forward and wrung Harry's hand with both of his own. 

"-good luck. I hope we meet again. The hopes of the Wizarding world rest upon your 

shoulders." 

"Oh," said Harry, "right. Thanks." 

"Farwell, Harry," said Hestia also clasping his hand. "Our thoughts go with you." 

"I hope everything's okay," said Harry with a glance toward Aunt Petunia and Dudley. 

"Oh, I'm sure we shall end up the best of chums," said Diggle slightly, waving his hat as he left 
the room. Hestia followed him. 

Dudley gently released himself from his mother's clutches and walked toward Harry who had to 
repress an urge to threaten him with magic. Then Dudley held out his large, pink hand. 

"Blimey, Dudley," said Harry over Aunt Petunia's renewed sobs, "did the dementors blow a 
different personality into you?" 

"Dunno," muttered Dudley, "See you, Harry." 

"Yea ...�� said Harry, taking Dudley's hand and shaking it. "Maybe. Take care, Big D." 

Dudley nearly smiled, then lumbered from the room. Harry heard his heavy footfalls on the 

graveled drive, and then a car door slammed. 

Aunt Petunia, whose face had been buried in her handkerchief, looked around at the sound. She 
did not seem to have expected to find herself alone with Harry. Hastily stowing her wet 
handkerchief into her pocket, she said, "Well �C good-bye" and marched towards the door without 
looking at him. 

"Good-bye," said Harry. 

She stopped and looked back. For a moment Harry had the strangest feeling that she wanted to 
say something to him. 

She gave him an odd, tremulous look and seemed to teeter on the edge of speech, but then, with 
a little jerk of her head, she hustled out of the room after he husband and son.

Chapter Four 

The Seven Potters 

Harry ran back upstairs to his bedroom, 


arriving at the 
window just in time to see the Dursleys' car 

swinging out 
of the drive and off up the road. Dedalus��s top 

hat was 
visible between Aunt Petunia and Dudley in the 

backseat. The 
car turned right at the end of Privet Drive, its 

windows 
burned scarlet for a moment in the now setting 

sun, and then 
it was gone. 

Harry picked up Hedwig��s cage, his Firebolt, and his rucksack, gave his unnaturally tidy 
bedroom one last sweeping look, and then made his ungainly way back downstairs to the hall, 
where he deposited cage, broomstick, and bag near the foot of the stairs. The light was fading 
rapidly, the hall full of shadows in the evening light. It felt most strange to stand here in the silence 
and know that he was about to leave the house for the last time. 

Long ago, when he had been left alone while the Dursleys went out to enjoy themselves, the 
hours of solitude had been a rare treat. Pausing only to sneak something tasty from the fridge, he 
had rushed upstairs to play on Dudley��s computer, or put on the television and flicked through the 
channels to his heart��s content. It gave him an odd, empty feeling remembering those times; it was 
like remembering a younger brother whom he had lost. 

��Don��t you want to take a last look at the place?�� he asked Hedwig, who was still sulking with 
her head under her wing. ��We��ll never be here again. Don��t you want to remember all the good 
times? I mean, look at this doormat. What memories ... Dudley sobbed on it after I saved him from 
the dementors ... Turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it? ... And last summer, 
Dumbledore walked through that front door ...�� 

Harry lost the thread of his thoughts for a moment and Hedwig did nothing to help him retrieve 
it, but continued to sit with her head under her wing. Harry turned his back on the front door. 

��And under here, Hedwig�� �C Harry pulled open a door under the stairs �C ��is where I used to 
sleep! You never knew me then �C Blimey, it��s small, I��d forgotten ... �� 

Harry looked around at the stacked shoes and umbrellas remembering how he used to wake

��32ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

every morning looking up at the underside of the staircase, which was more often than not adorned 
with a spider or two. 

Those had been the days before he had known anything about his true identity; before he had 
found out how his parents had died or why such strange things often happened around him. But 
Harry could still remember the dreams that had dogged him, even in those days, confused dreams 
involving flashes of green light and once �C Uncle Vernon had nearly crashed the car when Harry 
had recounted it �C a flying motorbike ... 

There was a sudden, deafening roar from somewhere nearby. Harry straightened up with a jerk 
and smacked the top of his head on the low door frame. Pausing only to employ a few of Uncle 
Vernon��s choicest swear words, he staggered back into the kitchen, clutching his head and staring 
out of the window into the back garden. 

The darkness seemed to be rippling, the air itself quivering. Then, one by one, figures began to 
pop���� into sight as their Disillusionment Charms lifted. Dominating the scene was Hagrid, 
wearing a helmet and goggles and sitting astride an enormous motorbike with a black sidecar 
attached. All around him other people were dismounting from brooms and, in two cases, skeletal, 
black winged horses. 

Wrenching open the back door, Harry hurtled into their midst. There was a general cry of 
greeting as Hermione flung her arms around him, Ron clapped him on the back, and Hagrid said, 
��All righ��, Harry? Ready fer the off?�� 

��Definitely,�� said Harry, beaming around at them all. ��But I wasn��t expecting this many of 
you!�� 

��Change of plan,�� growled Mad-Eye, who was holding two enormous bulging sacks, and 
whose magical eye was spinning from darkening sky to house to garden with dizzying rapidity. 
��Let��s get undercover before we talk you through it.�� 

Harry led them all back into the kitchen where, laughing and chattering, they settled on chairs, 
sat themselves upon Aunt Petunia��s gleaming work surfaces, or leaned up against her spotless 
appliances; Ron, long and lanky; Hermione, her bushy hair tied back in a long plait; Fred and 
George, grinning identically; Bill, badly scarred and long-haired; Mr. Weasley, kind-faced, 
balding, his spectacles a little awry; Mad-Eye, battle-worn, one-legged, his bright blue magical eye 
whizzing in its socket; Tonks, whose short hair was her favorite shade of bright pink; Lupin,

��33ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

grayer, more lined; Fleur, slender and beautiful, with her long silvery blonde hair; Kingsley, bald 
and broad-shouldered; Hagrid, with his wild hair and beard, standing hunchbacked to avoid hitting 
his head on the ceiling; and Mundungus Fletcher, small, dirty, and hangdog��������� ;�ͼ��� , 
with his droopy beady hound��s eyes and matted hair. Harry��s heart seemed to expand and glow at 
the sight. He felt incredibly fond of all of them, even Mundungus, whom he had tried to strangle 
the last time they had met. 

��Kingsley, I thought you were looking after the Muggle Prime Minister?�� he called across the 

room.

 ��He can get along without me for one night,�� said Kingsley, ��You��re more important.�� 

��Harry, guess what?�� said Tonks from her perch on top of the washing machine, and she 

wiggled her left hand at him; a ring glistened there. 

 ��You got married?�� Harry yelped, looking from her to Lupin.

 ��I��m sorry you couldn��t be there, Harry, it was very quiet.��

 ��That��s brilliant, congrat �C�� 

��All right, all right, we��ll have time for a cozy catch-up later,�� roared Moody over the hubbub 

(disturbance, commotion), and silence fell in the kitchen. 

Moody dropped his sacks at his feet and turned to Harry. ��As Dedalus probably told you, we 
had to abandon Plan A. Pius Thicknesse has gone over, which gives us a big problem. He��s made it 
an imprisonable offense to connect this house to the Floo Network, place a Portkey here, or 
Apparate in or out. All done in the name of your protection, to prevent You-Know-Who getting in 
at you. Absolutely pointless, seeing as your mother��s charm does that already. What he��s really 
done is to stop you getting out of here safely.��

 ��Second problem, you��re underage, which means you��ve still got the Trace on you.��

 ��I don��t �C�� 

��The Trace, the Trace!�� said Mad-Eye impatiently. ��The charm that detects magical activity 
around under-seventeens, the way the Ministry finds out about underage magic! If you, or anyone 
around you, casts a spell to get you out of here, Thicknesse is going to know about it, and so will 
the Death Eaters. 

��We can��t wait for the Trace to break, because the moment you turn seventeen you��ll lose all 
the protection your mother gave you. In short, Pius Thicknesse thinks he��s got you cornered good

��34ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and proper.��

 Harry could not help but agree with the unknown Thicknesse.

 ��So what are we going to do?�� 

��We��re going to use the only means of transport left to us, the only ones the Trace can��t detect, 
because we don��t need to cast spells to use them, brooms, thestrals, and Hagrid��s motorbike.�� 

Harry could see flaws in this plan; however, he held his tongue to give Mad-Eye the chance to 
address them. 

��Now, your mother��s charm will only break under two conditions, when you come of age, or -�� 
Moody gestured around the pristine��immaculate�� kitchen, ��-you no longer call this place 
home. You and your aunt and uncle are going your separate ways tonight, in the full understanding 
that you��re never going to live together again, correct?��

 Harry nodded. 

��So this time, when you leave, there��ll be no going back, and the charm will break the moment 
you get outside its range. We��re choosing to break it early, because the alternative is waiting for 
You-Know-Who to come and seize you the moment you turn seventeen. 

��The one thing we��ve got on our side is that You-Know-Who doesn��t know we��re moving you 
tonight. We��ve leaked a fake trail to the Ministry. They think you��re not leaving until the thirtieth. 
However, this is You-Know-Who we��re dealing with, so we can��t rely on him getting the date 
wrong; he��s bound to have a couple of Death Eaters patrolling the skies in this general area, just in 
case. So, we��ve given a dozen different houses every protection we can throw at them. They all 
look like they could be the place we��re going to hide you, they��ve all got some connection with the 
Order, my house, Kingsley��s place, Molly��s Auntie Muriel��s �C you get the idea.��

 ��Yeah,�� said Harry, not entirely truthfully, because he could still spot a gaping hole in the plan. 

��You��ll be going to Tonks��s parents. Once you��re within the boundaries of the protective 
enchantments we��ve put on their house you��ll be able to use a Portkey to the Burrow. Any 
questions?�� 

��Er �C yes,�� said Harry. ��Maybe they won��t know which of the twelve secure houses I��m 
heading for at first, but won��t it be sort of obvious once�� �C he performed a quick headcount �C 
��fourteen of us fly off toward Tonks��s parents?�� 

��Ah,�� said Moody, ��I forgot to mention the key point. Fourteen of us won��t be flying to

��35ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Tonks��s parents. There will be seven Harry Potters moving through the skies tonight, each of them 
with a companion, each pair heading for a different safe house.�� 

From inside his cloak Moody now withdrew a flask of what looked like mud. There was no 
need for him to say another word; Harry understood the rest of the plan immediately.

 ��No!�� he said loudly, his voice ringing through the kitchen. ��No way!��

 ��I told them you��d take it like this,�� said Hermione with a hint of complacency.

 ��If you think I��m going to let six people risk their lives -!��

 ��- because it��s the first time for all of us,�� said Ron. 

 ��This is different, pretending to be me �C�� 

��Well, none of us really fancy it, Harry,�� said Fred earnestly. ��Imagine if something went 

wrong and we were stuck as specky, scrawny gits forever.��

 Harry did not smile. ��You can��t do it if I don��t cooperate, you need me to give you some hair.�� 

��Well, that��s the plan scuppered (British) destroy),�� said George. ��Obviously there��s no chance 
at all of us getting a bit of your hair unless you cooperate.�� 

��Yeah, thirteen of us against one bloke who��s not allowed to use magic; we��ve got no chance,�� 
said Fred.

 ��Funny,�� said Harry, ��really amusing.�� 

��If it has to come to force, then it will,�� growled Moody, his magical eye now quivering a little 
in its socket as he glared at Harry. ��Everyone here��s overage, Potter, and they��re all prepared to 
take the risk.�� 

Mundungus shrugged and grimaced; the magical eye swerved sideways to glance at him out of 
the side of Moody��s head. 

��Let��s have no more arguments. Time��s wearing onʱ������� . I want a few of your hairs, 
boy, now.��

 ��But this is mad, there��s no need �C�� 

��No need!�� snarled Moody. ��With You-Know-Who out there and half the Ministry on his side? 
Potter, if we��re lucky he��ll have swallowed the fake bait and he��ll be planning to ambush you on 
the thirtieth, but he��d be mad not to have a Death Eater or two keeping an eye out, it��s what I��d do. 
They might not be able to get at you or this house while your mother��s charm holds, but it��s about 
to break and they know the rough position of the place. Our only chance is to use decoysȦ�� ,��

��36ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

ƭ. Even You-Know-Who can��t split himself into seven.��

 Harry caught Hermione��s eye and looked away at once. 

 ��So, Potter �C some of your hair, if you please.��

 Harry glanced at Ron, who grimaced at him in a just-do-it sort of way.

 ��Now!�� barked Moody. 

With all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head, grabbed a hank (coil) 
of hair, and pulled. 

��Good,�� said Moody, limping forward as he pulled the stopper out of the flask of potion. 
��Straight in here, if you please.�� 

Harry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made contact with its surface, 
the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at once, it turned a clear, bright gold. 

��Ooh, you look much tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry,�� said Hermione, before catching 
sight of Ron��s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly, and saying, ��Oh, you know what I mean �C 
Goyle��s potion tasted like bogies.��

 ��Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please,�� said Moody.

 Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Fleur lined up in front of Aunt Petunia��s gleaming sink. 

 ��We��re one short,�� said Lupin. 

��Here,�� said Hagrid gruffly, and he lifted Mundungus by the scruff of the neck and dropped 
him down beside Fleur, who wrinkled her nose pointedly and moved along to stand between Fred 

and George instead.

 ��I��m a soldier, I��d sooner be a protector,�� said Mundungus. 

��Shut it,�� growled Moody. ��As I��ve already told you, you spineless worm, any Death Eaters we 
run into will be aiming to capture Potter, not kill him. Dumbledore always said You-Know-Who 
would want to finish Potter in person. It��ll be the protectors who have got the most to worry about, 
the Death Eaters��ll want to kill them.�� 

Mundungus did not look particularly reassured, but Moody was already pulling half a dozen 
eggcup-sized glasses from inside his cloak, which he handed out, before pouring a little Polyjuice 
Potion into each one. 

 ��Altogether, then ... �� 

Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, Fleur, and Mundungus drank. All of them gasped and grimaced

��37ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

as the potion hit their throats; At once, their features began to bubble and distort like hot wax. 
Hermione and Mundungus were shooting upward; Ron, Fred, and George were shrinking; their 
hair was darkening, Hermione��s and Fleur��s appearing to shoot backward into their skulls. 

Moody, quite unconcerned, was now loosening the ties of the large sacks he had brought with 
him. When he straightened up again, there were six Harry Potters gasping and panting in front of 
him.

 Fred and George turned to each other and said together, ��Wow �C we��re identical!�� 

��I dunno, though, I think I��m still better-looking,�� said Fred, examining his reflection in the 
kettle. 

��Bah,�� said Fleur, checking herself in the microwave door, ��Bill, don��t look at me �C I��m 
��ideous.�� 

��Those whose clothes are a bit roomy, I��ve got smaller here,�� said Moody, indicating the first 
sack, ��and vice versa. Don��t forget the glasses, there��s six pairs in the side pocket. And when 
you��re dressed, there��s luggage in the other sack.�� 

The real Harry thought that this might just be the most bizarre thing he had ever seen, and he 
had seen some extremely odd things. He watched as his six doppelgangersĳ�˵ĸ��� (���Ե�
��) rummaged in the sacks, pulling out sets of clothes, putting on glasses, stuffing their own things 
away. He felt like asking them to show a little more respect for privacy as they all began stripping 
off with impunity (without punishment), clearly more at ease with displaying his body than they 
would have been with their own. 

 ��I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo,�� said Ron, looking down at his bare chest.

 ��Harry, your eyesight really is awful,�� said Hermione, as she put on glasses. 

Once dressed, the fake Harrys took rucksacks and owl cages, each containing a stuffed snowy 
owl, from the second sack. 

��Good,�� said Moody, as at last seven dressed, bespectacled, and luggage-laden Harrys faced 

him. ��The pairs will be as follows, Mundungus will be traveling with me, by broom �C��

 ��Why��m I with you?�� grunted the Harry nearest the back door. 

��Because you��re the one that needs watching,�� growled Moody, and sure enough, his magical 
eye did not waver from Mundungus as he continued, ��Arthur and Fred �C�� 

��I��m George,�� said the twin at whom Moody was pointing. ��Can��t you even tell us apart when

��38ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

we��re Harry?��

 ��Sorry, George �C��

 ��I��m only yanking your wand, I��m Fred really �C�� 

��Enough messing around!�� snarled Moody. ��The other one �C George or Fred or whoever you 

are �C you��re with Remus. Miss Delacour �C��

 ��I��m taking Fleur on a thestral,�� said Bill. ��She��s not that fond of brooms.�� 

Fleur walked over to stand beside him, giving him a soppy (overly sentimental), slavish look 

that Harry hoped with all his heart would never appear on his face again.

 ��Miss Granger with Kingsley, again by thestral �C�� 

Hermione looked reassured as she answered Kingsley��s smile; Harry knew that Hermione too 
lacked confidence on a broomstick. 

��Which leaves you and me, Ron!�� said Tonks brightly, knocking over a mug tree�ұ��� as she 
waved at him.

 Ron did not look quite as pleased as Hermione. 

��An�� you��re with me, Harry. That all righ��?�� said Hagrid, looking a little anxious. ��We��ll be on 

the bike, brooms an�� thestrals can��t take me weight, see. Not a lot o�� room on the seat with me on 

it, though, so you��ll be in the sidecar.��

 ��That��s great,�� said Harry, not altogether truthfully. 

��We think the Death Eaters will expect you to be on a broom,�� said Moody, who seemed to 
guess how Harry was feeling. ��Snape��s had plenty of time to tell them everything about you he��s 
never mentioned before, so if we do run into any Death Eaters, we��re betting they��ll choose one of 
the Potters who looks at home on a broomstick. All right then,�� he went on, tying up the sack with 
the fake Potters�� clothes in it and leading the way back to the door, ��I make it three minutes until 
we��re supposed to leave. No point locking the back door, it won��t keep the Death Eaters out when 
they come looking. Come on ...�� 

Harry hurried to gather his rucksack, Firebolt, and Hedwig��s cage and followed the group to the 
dark back garden. 

On every side broomsticks were leaping into hands; Hermione had already been helped up onto 
a great black thestral by Kingsley, Fleur onto the other by Bill. Hagrid was standing ready beside 
the motorbike, goggles on. 

��39ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Is this it? Is this Sirius��s bike?�� 

��The very same,�� said Hagrid, beaming down at Harry. ��An�� the last time yeh was on it, Harry, 
I could fit yeh in one hand!�� 

Harry could not help but feel a little humiliated as he got into the sidecar. It placed him several 
feet below everybody else, Ron smirked at the sight of him sitting there like a child in a bumper 
car. Harry stuffed his rucksack and broomstick down by his feet and rammed Hedwig��s cage 
between his knees. He was extremely uncomfortable. 

��Arthur��s done a bit o�� tinkerin��,�� said Hagrid, quite oblivious to Harry��s discomfort. He settled 
himself astride the motorcycle, which creaked slightly and sank inches into the ground. ��It��s got a 
few tricks up its sleeves (concealed, hidden) now. Tha�� one was my idea.�� He pointed a thick 
finger at a purple button near the speedometer. 

"Please be careful, Hagrid." said Mr. Weasley, who was standing beside them, holding his 
broomstick. "I'm still not sure that was advisable and it's certainly only to be used in emergencies." 

"All right, then." said Moody. "Everyone ready, please. I want us all to leave at exactly the same 
time or the whole point of the diversion's lost." 

Everybody motioned their heads. 

"Hold tight now, Ron," said Tonks, and Harry saw Ron throw a forcing, guilty look at Lupin 
before placing his hands on each side of her waist. Hagrid kicked the motorbike into life, it roared 
like a dragon, and the sidecar began to vibrate. 

��Good luck, everyone,�� shouted Moody. ��See you all in about an hour at the Burrow. On the 
count of three. One ... two .. THREE.��

 There was a great roar from the motorbike, and Harry felt the sidecar give a nasty lurch. He was 
rising through the air fast, his eyes watering slightly, hair whipped back off his face. Around him 
brooms were soaring upward too; the long black tail of a thestral flicked past. His legs, jammed 
into the sidecar by Hedwig��s cage and his rucksack, were already sore and starting to go numb. So 
great was his discomfort that he almost forgot to take a last glimpse of number four Privet Drive. 
By the time he looked over the edge of the sidecar he could no longer tell which one it was. 

And then, out of nowhere, out of nothing, they were surrounded. At least thirty hooded figures, 
suspended in midair, formed a vast circle in the middle of which the Order members had risen, 
oblivious �C 

��40ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Screams, a blaze of green light on every side, Hagrid gave a yell and the motorbike rolled over. 
Harry lost any sense of where they were. Streetlights above him, yells around him, he was clinging 
to the sidecar for dear life. Hedwig's cage, the Firebolt, and his rucksack slipped from beneath his 
knees �C 

"No �C HELP!" 

The broomstick spun too, but he just managed to seize the strap of his rucksack and the top of 
the cage as the motorbike swung the right way up again. A second's relief, and then another burst 
of green light. The owl screeched and fell to the floor of the cage. 

"No �C NO!" 

The motorbike zoomed forward; Harry glimpsed hooded Death Eaters scattering as Hagrid 
blasted through their circle. 

"Hedwig �C Hedwig �C" 

But the owl lay motionless and pathetic as a toy on the floor of her cage. He could not take it in, 
and his terror for the others was paramount. He glanced over his shoulder and saw a mass of 
people moving, flares of green light, two pairs of people on brooms soaring off into the distance, 
but he could not tell who they were �C 

"Hagrid, we've got to go back, we've got to go back!" he yelled over the thunderous roar of the 
engine, pulling out his wand, ramming Hedwig's cage into the floor, refusing to believe that she 
was dead. "Hagrid, TURN AROUND!" 

"My job's ter get you there safe, Harry!" bellow Hagrid, and he opened the throttle����. 

"Stop �C STOP!" Harry shouted, but as he looked back again two jets of green light flew past his 
left ear, Four Death Eaters had broken away from the circle and were pursuing them, aiming for 
Hagrid's broad back. Hagrid swerved, but the Death Eaters were keeping up with the bike; more 
curses shot after them, and Harry had to sink low into the sidecar to avoid them. Wriggling around 
he cried, "Stupefy!" and a red bolt of light shot from his own wand, cleaving a gap between the 
four pursuing Death Eaters as they scattered to avoid it. 

"Hold on, Harry, this'll do for 'em!" roared Hagrid, and Harry looked up just in time to see 
Hagrid slamming a thick finger into a green button near the fuel gauge. 

A wall, a solid black wall, erupted out of the exhaust pipe. Craning his neck, Harry saw it 
expand into being in midair. Three of the Death Eaters swerved and avoided it, but the fourth was

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

not so lucky; He vanished from view and then dropped like a boulder from behind it, his 
broomstick broken into pieces. One of his fellows slowed up to save him, but they and the airborne 
wall were swallowed by darkness as Hagrid leaned low over the handlebars and sped up. 

More Killing Curses flew past Harry's head from the two remaining Death Eaters' wands; they 
were aiming for Hagrid. Harry responded with further Stunning Spells, Red and green collided in 
midair in a shower of multicolored sparks, and Harry thought wildly of fireworks, and the Muggles 
below who would have no idea what was happening �C 

"Here we go again, Harry, hold on!" yelled Hagrid, and he jabbed at a second button. This time 
a great net burst from the bike's exhaust, but the Death Eaters were ready for it. Not only did they 
swerve to avoid it, but the companion who had slowed to save their unconscious friend had caught 
up. He bloomed suddenly out of the darkness and now three of them were pursuing the motorbike, 
all shooting curses after it. 

"This'll do it, Harry, hold on tight!" yelled Hagrid, and Harry saw him slam his whole hand onto 
the purple button beside the speedometer. 

With an unmistakable bellowing roar, dragon fire burst from the exhaust, white-hot and blue, 
and the motorbike shot forward like a bullet with a sound of wrenching metal. Harry saw the Death 
Eaters swerve out of sight to avoid the deadly trail of flame, and at the same time felt the sidecar 
sway ominously, its metal connections to the bike had splintered with the force of acceleration. 

"It's all righ', Harry!" bellowed Hagrid, now thrown flat onto the back by the surge of speed; 
nobody was steering now, and the sidecar was starting to twist violently in the bike's slipstream. 

"I'm on it, Harry, don' worry!" Hagrid yelled, and from inside his jacket pocket he pulled his 
flowery pink umbrella. 

"Hagrid! No! Let me!" 

"REPARO!" 

There was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely. Harry sped 

forward, propelled by the impetus of the bike's flight, then the sidecar began to lose height �C 

In desperation Harry pointed his wand at the sidecar and shouted, "Wingardium Leviosa!" 

The sidecar rose like a cork, unsteerable but at least still airborne. He had but a split second's 
relief, however, as more curses streaked past him, the three Death Eaters were closing in. 

"I'm comin', Harry!" Hagrid yelled from out of the darkness, but Harry could feel the sidecar

��42ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

beginning to sink again, Crouching as low as he could, he pointed at the middle of the oncoming 
figures and yelled, "Impedimenta!" 

The jinx hit the middle Death Eater in the chest; for a moment the man was absurdly spreadeagled 
in midair as though he had hit an invisible barrier, one of his fellows almost collided with 
him �C 

Then the sidecar began to fall in earnest, and the remaining Death Eater shot a curse so close to 

Harry that he had to duck below the rim of the car, knocking out a tooth on the edge of his seat �C 

"I'm comin', Harry, I'm comin'!" 

A huge hand seized the back of Harry's robes and hoisted him out of the plummeting sidecar; 
Harry pulled his rucksack with him as he dragged himself onto the motorbike's seat and found 
himself back-to-back with Hagrid. As they soared upward, away from the two remaining Death 
Eaters, Harry spat blood out of his mouth, pointed his wand at the falling sidecar, and yelled, 
"Confringo!" 

He knew a dreadful, gut-wrenching pang for Hedwig as it exploded; the Death Eater nearest it 
was blasted off his broom and fell from sight; his companion fell back and vanished. 

"Harry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry," moaned Hagrid, "I shouldn'ta tried ter repair it meself �C yeh've got 
no room �C" 

"It's not a problem, just keep flying!" Harry shouted back, as two more Death Eaters emerged 
out of the darkness, drawing closer. 

As the curses came shooting across the intervening space again, Hagrid swerved and zigzagged, 
Harry knew that Hagrid did not dare use the dragon-fire button again, with Harry seated so 
insecurely. Harry sent Stunning Spell after Stunning Spell back at their pursuers, barely holding 
them off. He shot another blocking jinx at them, the closest Death Eater swerved to avoid it and his 
hood slipped, and by the red light of his next Stunning Spell, Harry saw the strangely blank face of 
Stanley Shunpike �C Stan �C 

"Expelliarmus!" Harry yelled. 

"That's him, it's him, it's the real one!" 

The hooded Death Eater's shout reached Harry even above the thunder of the motorbike's 
engine. Next moment, both pursuers had fallen back and disappeared from view. 

"Harry, what's happened?" bellowed Hagrid. "Where've they gone?" 

��43ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I don't know!" 

But Harry was afraid. The hooded Death Eater had shouted, "It's the real one!"; how had he 
known? He gazed around at the apparently empty darkness and felt its menace. Where were they? 

He clambered around on the seat to face forward and seized hold of the back of Hagrid's jacket. 

"Hagrid, do the dragon-fire thing again, let's get out of here!" 

"Hold on tight, then, Harry!" 

There was a deafening, screeching roar again and the white-blue fire shot from the exhaust, 

Harry felt himself slipping backwards off what little of the seat he had. Hagrid flung backward 

upon him, barely maintaining his grip on the handlebars �C 

"I think we've lost 'em Harry, I think we've done it!" yelled Hagrid. 

But Harry was not convinced; Fear lapped at him as he looked left and right for pursuers he was 

sure would come... Why had they fallen back? One of them had still had a wand... It's him... it's the 

real one... They had said it right after he had tried to Disarm Stan.. 

"We're nearly there, Harry, we've nearly made it!" shouted Hagrid. 

Harry felt the bike drop a little, though the lights down on the ground still seemed remote as 
stars. 

Then the scar on his forehead burned like fire, as a Death Eater appeared on either side of the 
bike, two Killing Curses missed Harry by millimeters, cast from behind �C 

And then Harry saw him. Voldemort was flying like smoke on the wind, without broomstick or 
thestral to hold him, his snake-like face gleaming out of the blackness, his white fingers raising his 
wand again �C 

Hagrid let out a bellow of fear and steered the motorbike into a vertical dive. Clinging on for 
dear life, Harry sent Stunning Spells flying at random into the whirling night. He saw a body fly 
past him and knew he had hit one of them, but then he heard a bang and saw sparks from the 
engine; the motorbike spiraled through the air, completely out of control �C 

Green jets of light shot past them again. Harry had no idea which way was up, which down, His 
scar was still burning; he expected to die at any second. A hooded figure on a broomstick was feet 
from him, he saw it raise its arm �C 

"NO!" 

With a shout of fury Hagrid launched himself off the bike at the Death Eater; to his horror,

��44ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry saw both Hagrid and the Death Eater, falling out of sight, their combined weight too much 

for the broomstick �C 

Barely gripping the plummeting bike with his knees, Harry heard Voldemort scream, "Mine!" 

It was over, He could not see or hear where Voldemort was; he glimpsed another Death Eater 

swooping out of the way and heard, "Avada �C" 

As the pain from Harry's scar forced his eyes shut, his wand acted of its own accord. He felt it 
drag his hand around like some great magnet, saw a spurt of golden fire through his half-closed 
eyelids, heard a crack and a scream of fury. The remaining Death Eater yelled; Voldemort 
screamed, "NO!" Somehow, Harry found his nose an inch from the dragon-fire button. He punched 
it with his wand-free hand and the bike shot more flames into the air, hurtling straight toward the 
ground. 

"Hagrid!" Harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life. "Hagrid �C Accio Hagrid!" 

The motorbike sped up, sucked towards the earth. Face level with the handlebars, Harry could 
see nothing but distant lights growing nearer and nearer, He was going to crash and there was 
nothing he could do about it. Behind him came another scream, "Your wand, Selwyn, give me your 
wand!" 

He felt Voldemort before he saw him. Looking sideways, he stared into the red eyes and was 
sure they would be the last thing he ever saw, Voldemort preparing to curse him once more. 

And then Voldemort vanished. Harry looked down and saw Hagrid spread-eagled on the ground 
below him. He pulled hard at the handlebars to avoid hitting him, groped for the brake, but with an 
earsplitting, ground trembling crash, he smashed into a muddy pond.

Chapter Five 
Fallen Warrior 



"Hagrid?" 

Harry struggled to raise himself out of the debris 


of metal and 
leather that surrounded him; his hands sank into 

inches of 
muddy water as he tried to stand. He could not 

understand 
where Voldemort had gone and expected him to 

swoop out of 
the darkness at any moment. Something hot and wet 

was trickling 
down his chin and from his forehead. He crawled out of the 

pond and stumbled toward the great dark mass on the ground that was Hagrid. 

"Hagrid? Hagrid, talk to me �C" 

But the dark mass did not stir. 

"Who's there? Is it Potter? Are you Harry Potter?" 

Harry did not recognize the man's voice. Then a woman shouted. "They've crashed. Ted! 

Crashed in the garden!" 

Harry's head was swimming. 

"Hagrid," he repeated stupidly, and his knees buckled. 

The next thing he knew, he was lying on his back on what felt like cushions, with a burning 
sensation in his ribs and right arm. His missing tooth had been regrown. The scar on his forehead 
was still throbbing. 

"Hagrid?" 

He opened his eyes and saw that he was lying on a sofa in an unfamiliar, lamplit sitting room. 
His rucksack lay on the floor a short distance away, wet and muddy. A fair-haired, big-bellied man 
was watching Harry anxiously. 

"Hagrid's fine, son," said the man, "the wife's seeing to him now. How are you feeling? 
Anything else broken? I've fixed your ribs, your tooth, and your arm. I'm Ted, by the way, Ted 
Tonks �C Dora's father." 

Harry sat up too quickly. Lights popped in front of his eyes and he felt sick and giddy.

��46ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Voldemort �C" 

"Easy, now," said Ted Tonks, placing a hand on Harry's shoulder and pushing him back against 
the cushions. "That was a nasty crash you just had. What happened, anyway? Something go wrong 
with the bike? Arthur Weasley overstretch himself again, him and his Muggle contraptions?" 

"No," said Harry, as his scar pulsed like an open wound. "Death Eaters, loads of them �C we were 
chased �C" 

"Death Eaters?" said Ted sharply. "What d'you mean, Death Eaters? I thought they didn't know 
you were being moved tonight, I thought �C" 

"They knew," said Harry. 

Ted Tonks looked up at the ceiling as though he could see through it to the sky above. 

"Well, we know our protective charms hold, then, don't we? They shouldn't be able to get within 

a hundred yards of the place in any direction." 

Now Harry understood why Voldemort had vanished; it had been at the point when the 
motorbike crossed the barrier of the Order's charms. He only hoped they would continue to work, 
He imagined Voldemort, a hundred yards above them as they spoke, looking for a way to penetrate 
what Harry visualized as a great transparent bubble. 

He swung his legs off the sofa; he needed to see Hagrid with his own eyes before he would 
believe that he was alive. He had barely stood up, however, when a door opened and Hagrid 
squeezed through it, his face covered in mud and blood, limping a little but miraculously alive. 

"Harry!" 

Knocking over two delicate tables and an aspidistra֩�뱧����ֲ�� , he covered the floor 
between them in two strides and pulled Harry into a hug that nearly cracked his newly repaired 
ribs. "Blimey, Harry, how did yeh get out o' that? I thought we were both goners." 

"Yeah, me too. I can't believe �C" 

Harry broke off. He had just noticed the woman who had entered the room behind Hagrid. 

"You!" he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty. 

"Your wand's here, son," said Ted, tapping it on Harry's arm. "It fell right beside you, I picked it 
up... And that's my wife you're shouting at." 

"Oh, I'm �C I'm sorry." 

As she moved forward into the room, Mrs. Tonks's resemblance to her sister Bellatrix became

��47ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

much less pronounced, Her hair was a light��s soft brown and her eyes were wider and kinder. 
Nevertheless, she looked a little haughty after Harry's exclamation. 

"What happened to our daughter?" she asked. "Hagrid said you were ambushed; where is 
Nymphadora?" 

"I don't know," said Harry. "We don't know what happened to anyone else." 

She and Ted exchanged looks. A mixture of fear and guilt gripped Harry at the sight of their 
expressions, if any of the others had died, it was his fault, all his fault. He had consented to the 
plan, given them his hair... 

"The Portkey," he said, remembering all of a sudden. "We've got to get back to the Burrow and 
find out �C then we'll be able to send you word, or �C or Tonks will, once she's �C" 

"Dora'll be ok, Dromeda," said Ted. "She knows her stuff, she's been in plenty of tight spots 
(difficult positions) with the Aurors. The Portkey's through here," he added to Harry. "It's 
supposed to leave in three minutes, if you want to take it." 

"Yeah, we do," said Harry. He seized his rucksack, swung it onto his shoulders. "I �C" 

He looked at Mrs. Tonks, wanting to apologize for the state of fear in which he left her and for 
which he felt so terribly responsible, but no words occurred to him that he did not seem hollow and 
insincere. 

"I'll tell Tonks �C Dora �C to send word, when she ... Thanks for patching us up, thanks for 
everything, I �C" 

He was glad to leave the room and follow Ted Tonks along a short hallway and into a bedroom. 
Hagrid came after them, bending low to avoid hitting his head on the door lintel. 

"There you go, son. That's the Portkey." 

Mr. Tonks was pointing to a small, silver-backed hairbrush��ˢlying on the dressing table. 

"Thanks," said Harry, reaching out to place a finger on it, ready to leave. 

"Wait a moment," said Hagrid, looking around. "Harry, where's Hedwig?" 

"She ... she got hit," said Harry. 

The realization crashed over him, He felt ashamed of himself as the tears stung his eyes. The 
owl had been his companion, his one great link with the magical world whenever he had been 
forced to return to the Dursleys. 

Hagrid reached out a great hand and patted him painfully on the shoulder. 

��48ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Never mind," he said gruffly, "Never mind. She had a great old life �C" 

"Hagrid!" said Ted Tonks warningly, as the hairbrush glowed bright blue, and Hagrid only just 
got his forefinger to it in time. 

With a jerk behind the navel as though an invisible hook and line had dragged him forward, 
Harry was pulled into nothingness, spinning uncontrollably, his finger glued to the Portkey as he 
and Hagrid hurtled away from Mr. Tonks. Second later, Harry's feet slammed onto hard ground 
and he fell onto his hands and knees in the yard of the Burrow. He heard screams. Throwing aside 
the no longer glowing hairbrush, Harry stood up, swaying slightly, and saw Mrs. Weasley and 
Ginny running down the steps by the back door as Hagrid, who had also collapsed on landing, 
clambered laboriously to his feet. 

"Harry? You are the real Harry? What happened? Where are the others?" cried Mrs. Weasley. 

"What d'you mean? Isn't anyone else back?" Harry panted. 

The answer was clearly etched in Mrs. Weasley's pale face. 

"The Death Eaters were waiting for us," Harry told her, "We were surrounded the moment we 
took off �C they knew it was tonight �C I don't know what happened to anyone else, four of them 
chased us, it was all we could do to get away, and then Voldemort caught up with us �C" 

He could hear the self-justifying note in his voice, the plea for her to understand why he did not 
know what had happened to her sons, but �C 

"Thank goodness you're all right," she said, pulling him into a hug he did not feel he deserved. 

"Haven't go' any brandy, have yeh, Molly?" asked Hagrid a little shakily, "Fer medicinal 

purposes?" 

She could have summoned it by magic, but as she hurried back toward the crooked house, Harry 
knew that she wanted to hide her face. He turned to Ginny and she answered his unspoken plea for 
information at once. 

"Ron and Tonks should have been back first, but they missed their Portkey, it came back 
without them," she said, pointing at a rusty oil can lying on the ground nearby. "And that one," she 
pointed at an ancient sneaker, "should have been Dad and Fred's, they were supposed to be second. 
You and Hagrid were third and," she checked her watch, "if they made it, George and Lupin ought 
to be back in about a minute." 

Mrs. Weasley reappeared carrying a bottle of brandy, which she handed to Hagrid. He uncorked

��49ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

it and drank it straight down in one. 

"Mum!" shouted Ginny pointing to a spot several feet away. 

A blue light had appeared in the darkness. It grew larger and brighter, and Lupin and George 
appeared, spinning and then falling. Harry knew immediately that there was something wrong, 
Lupin was supporting George, who was unconscious and whose face was covered in blood. 

Harry ran forward and seized George's legs. Together, he and Lupin carried George into the 
house and through the kitchen to the living room, where they laid him on the sofa. As the 
lamplight fell across George's head, Ginny gasped and Harry's stomach lurched, one of George's 
ears was missing. The side of his head and neck were drenched in wet, shockingly scarlet blood. 

No sooner had Mrs. Weasley bent over her son that Lupin grabbed Harry by the upper arm and 
dragged him, none too gently, back into the kitchen, where Hagrid was still attempting to ease his 
bulk through the back door. 

"Oi!" said Hagrid indignantly, "Le' go of him! Le' go of Harry!" 

Lupin ignored him. 

"What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter visited my office at Hogwarts?" 
he said, giving Harry a small shake. "Answer me!" 

"A �C a grindylow in a tank, wasn't it?" 

Lupin released Harry and fell back against a kitchen cupboard. 

"Wha' was tha' about?" roared Hagrid. 

"I'm sorry, Harry, but I had to check," said Lupin tersely. "We've been betrayed. Voldemort 

knew that you were being moved tonight and the only people who could have told him were 

directly involved in the plan. You might have been an impostor." 

"So why aren' you checkin' me?" panted Hagrid, still struggling with the door. 

"You're half-giant," said Lupin, looking up at Hagrid. "The Polyjuice Potion is designed for 

human use only." 

"None of the Order would have told Voldemort we were moving tonight," said Harry. The idea 
was dreadful to him, he could not believe it of any of them. "Voldemort only caught up with me 
toward the end, he didn't know which one I was in the beginning. If he'd been in on the plan he'd 
have known from the start I was the one with Hagrid." 

"Voldemort caught up with you?" said Lupin sharply. "What happened? How did you escape?" 

��50ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry explained how the Death Eaters pursuing them had seemed to recognize him as the true 
Harry, how they had abandoned the chase, how they must have summoned Voldemort, who had 
appeared just before he and Hagrid had reached the sanctuary of Tonks's parents. 

"They recognized you? But how? What had you done?" 

"I ...�� Harry tried to remember; the whole journey seemed like a blur of panic and confusion. "I 
saw Stan Shunpike ... You know, the bloke who was the conductor on the Knight Bus? And I tried 
to Disarm him instead of �C well, he doesn't know what he's doing, does he? He must be 
Imperiused!" 

Lupin looked aghast. 

"Harry, the time for Disarming is past! These people are trying to capture and kill you! At least 
Stun if you aren't prepared to kill!" 

"We were hundreds of feet up! Stan's not himself, and if I Stunned him and he'd fallen, he'd 
have died the same as if I'd used Avada Kedavra! Expelliarmus saved me from Voldemort two 
years ago," Harry added defiantly. Lupin was reminding him of the sneering Hufflepuff Zacharias 
Smith, who had jeered at Harry for wanting to teach Dumbledore's Army how to Disarm. 

"Yes, Harry," said Lupin with painful restraint, "and a great number of Death Eaters witnessed 
that happening! Forgive me, but it was a very unusual move then, under the imminent threat of 
death. Repeating it tonight in front of Death Eaters who either witnessed or heard about the first 
occasion was close to suicidal!" 

"So you think I should have killed Stan Shunpike?" said Harry angrily. 

"Of course not," said Lupin, "but the Death Eaters �C frankly, most people! �C would have 
expected you to attack back! Expelliarmus is a useful spell, Harry, but the Death Eaters seem to 
think it is your signature move, and I urge you not to let it become so!" 

Lupin was making Harry feel idiotic, and yet there was still a grain of defiance inside him. 

"I won't blast people out of my way just because they're there," said Harry, "That's Voldemort's 
job." 

Lupin's retort was lost. 

Finally succeeding in squeezing through the door, Hagrid staggered to a chair and sat down; it 
collapsed beneath him. 

Ignoring his mingled oaths and apologies, Harry addressed Lupin again. "Will George be okay?"

��51ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

All Lupin's frustration with Harry seemed to drain away at the question. 

"I think so, although there's no chance of replacing his ear, not when it's been cursed off �C" 

There was a scuffling���Ž��� from outside. Lupin dived for the back door; Harry leapt over 
Hagrid's legs and sprinted into the yard. 

Two figures had appeared in the yard, and as Harry ran toward them he realized they were 
Hermione, now returning to her normal appearance, and Kingsley, both clutching a bent coat 
hanger. Hermione flung herself into Harry's arms, but Kingsley showed no pleasure at the sight of 
any of them. Over Hermione's shoulder Harry saw him raise his wand and point it at Lupin's chest. 

"The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us!" 

"'Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him,'" said Lupin calmly. 

Kingsley turned his wand on Harry, but Lupin said, "It's him, I've checked!" 

"All right, all right!" said Kingsley, stowing his wand back beneath his cloak, "But somebody 
betrayed us! They knew, they knew it was tonight!" 

"So it seems," replied Lupin, "but apparently they did not realize that there would be seven 

Harrys." 

"Small comfort!" snarled Kingsley. "Who else is back?" 

"Only Harry, Hagrid, George, and me." 

Hermione stifled a little moan behind her hand. 

"What happened to you?" Lupin asked Kingsley. 

"Followed by five, injured two, might've killed one," Kingsley reeled off (say easily), "and we 

saw You-Know-Who as well, he joined the chase halfway through but vanished pretty quickly. 

Remus, he can �C" 

"Fly," supplied Harry. "I saw him too, he came after Hagrid and me." 

"So that's why he left, to follow you!" said Kingsley, "I couldn't understand why he'd vanished. 

But what made him change targets?" 

"Harry behaved a little too kindly to Stan Shunpike," said Lupin. 

"Stan?" repeated Hermione. "But I thought he was in Azkaban?" 

Kingsley let out a mirthless laugh. "Hermione, there's obviously been a mass breakout which the 
Ministry has hushed up. Travers's hood fell off when I cursed him, he's supposed to be inside too. 
But what happened to you, Remus? Where's George?" 

��52ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"He lost an ear," said Lupin. 

"Lost an -?" repeated Hermione in a high voice. 

"Snape's work," said Lupin. 

"Snape?" shouted Harry. "You didn't say �C" 

"He lost his hood during the chase. Sectumsempra was always a specialty of Snape's. I wish I 
could say I'd paid him back in kind, but it was all I could do to keep George on the broom after he 
was injured, he was losing so much blood." 

Silence fell between the four of them as they looked up at the sky. There was no sign of 
movement; the stars stared back, unblinking, indifferent, unobscured by flying friends. Where was 
Ron? Where were Fred and Mr. Weasley? Where were Bill, Fleur, Tonks, Mad-Eye, and 
Mundungus? 

"Harry, give us a hand!" called Hagrid hoarsely from the door, in which he was stuck again. 
Glad of something to do, Harry pulled him free. They headed through the empty kitchen and back 
into the sitting room, where Mrs. Weasley and Ginny were still tending to George. Mrs. Weasley 
had staunched (cause a wound to stop bleeding) his bleeding now, and by the lamplight Harry saw 
a clean gaping hole where George's ear had been. 

"How is he?" 

Mrs. Weasley looked around and said, "I can't make it grow back, not when it's been removed 
by Dark Magic. But it could've been so much worse ... He's alive." 

"Yeah," said Harry. "Thank God." 

"Did I hear someone else in the yard?" Ginny asked. 

"Hermione and Kingsley," said Harry. 

"Thank goodness," Ginny whispered. They looked at each other; Harry wanted to hug her, hold 
on to her; he did not even care much that Mrs. Weasley was there, but before he could act on the 
impulse, there was a great crash from the kitchen. 

"I'll prove who I am, Kingsley, after I've seen my son, now back off if you know what's good for 
you!" 

Harry had never heard Mr. Weasley shout like that before. He burst into the living room, his 
bald patch gleaming with sweat, his spectacles askew, Fred right behind him, both pale but 
uninjured.

"Arthur!" sobbed Mrs. Weasley. "Oh thank goodness!" 

"How is he?" 

Mr. Weasley dropped to his knees beside George. For the first time since Harry had known him, 
Fred seemed to be lost for words. He gaped over the back of the sofa at his twin's wound as if he 

could not believe what he was seeing. 

Perhaps roused by the sound of Fred and their father's arrival, George stirred. 

"How do you feel, Georgie?" whispered Mrs. Weasley. 

George's fingers groped for the side of his head. 

"Saint-like," he murmured. 

"What's wrong with him?" croaked Fred, looking terrified. "Is his mind affected?" 

"Saint-like," repeated George, opening his eyes and looking up at his brother. "You see... I'm 
holy. Holey, Fred, geddit?" 

Mrs. Weasley sobbed harder than ever. Color flooded Fred's pale face. "Pathetic," he told 
George. "Pathetic! With the whole wide world of ear-related humor before you, you go for holey?" 

"Ah well," said George, grinning at his tear-soaked mother. "You'll be able to tell us apart now, 
anyway, Mum." He looked around. "Hi, Harry �C you are Harry, right?" 

"Yeah, I am," said Harry, moving closer to the sofa. 

"Well, at least we got you back okay," said George. "Why aren't Ron and Bill huddled round my 
sickbed?" 

"They're not back yet, George," said Mrs. Weasley. George's grin faded. Harry glanced at Ginny 
and motioned to her to accompany him back outside. 

As they walked through the kitchen she said in a low voice. "Ron and Tonks should be back by 
now. They didn't have a long journey; Auntie Muriel's not that far from here." 

Harry said nothing. He had been trying to keep fear at bay ever since reaching the Burrow, but 
now it enveloped him, seeming to crawl over his skin, throbbing in his chest, clogging his throat. 
As they walked down the back steps into the dark yard, Ginny took his hand. 

Kingsley was striding backward and forward, glancing up at the sky every time he turned. Harry 
was reminded of Uncle Vernon pacing the living room a million years ago. Hagrid, Hermione, and 
Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, gazing upward in silence. None of them looked around when 
Harry and Ginny joined their silent vigil.

The minutes stretched into what might as well have been years. The slightest breath of wind 
made them all jump and turn toward the whispering bush or tree in the hope that one of the missing 
Order members might leap unscathed from its leaves �C 

And then a broom materialized directly above them and streaked toward the ground �C 

"It's them!" screamed Hermione. 

Tonks landed in a long skid that sent earth and pebbles everywhere. 

"Remus!" Tonks cried as she staggered off the broom into Lupin's arms. His face was set and 
white. He seemed unable to speak, Ron tripped dazedly toward Harry and Hermione. 

"You're okay," he mumbled, before Hermione flew at him and hugged him tightly. "I thought �C I 

thought �C" 

"'M all right," said Ron, patting her on the back. "'M fine." 

"Ron was great," said Tonks warmly, relinquishing her hold on Lupin. "Wonderful. Stunned one 

of the Death Eaters, straight to the head, and when you're aiming at a moving target from a flying 

broom �C" 

"You did?" said Hermione, gazing up at Ron with her arms still around his neck. 

"Always the tone of surprise," he said a little grumpily, breaking free. "Are we the last back?" 

"No," said Ginny, "we're still waiting for Bill and Fleur and Mad-Eye and Mundungus. I'm 

going to tell Mum and Dad you're okay, Ron �C" 

She ran back inside. 

"So what kept you? What happened?" Lupin sounded almost angry at Tonks. 

"Bellatrix," said Tonks. "She wants me quite as much as she wants Harry, Remus. She tried very 

hard to kill me. I just wish I'd got her, I owe Bellatrix. But we definitely injured Rodolphus ... 

Then we got to Ron's Auntie Muriel's and we missed our Portkey and she was fussing over us �C" 

A muscle was jumping in Lupin's jaw. He nodded, but seemed unable to say anything else. 

"So what happened to you lot?" Tonks asked, turning to Harry, Hermione, and Kingsley. 

They recounted the stories of their own journeys, but all the time the continued absence of Bill, 
Fleur, Mad-Eye and Mundungus seemed to lie upon them like a frost, its icy bite harder and harder 
to ignore. 

"I'm going to have to get back to Downing Street, I should have been there an hour ago," said 
Kingsley finally, after a last sweeping gaze at the sky. "Let me know when they're back." 

��55ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Lupin nodded. With a wave to the others, Kingsley walked away into the darkness toward the 
gate. Harry thought he heard the faintest pop as Kingsley Disapparated just beyond the Burrow's 
boundaries. 

Mr. And Mrs. Weasley came racing down the back steps, Ginny behind them. Both parents 

hugged Ron before turning to Lupin and Tonks. 

"Thank you," said Mrs. Weasley, "for our sons." 

"Don't be silly, Molly," said Tonks at once. 

"How's George?" asked Lupin. 

"What's wrong with him?" piped up Ron. 

"He's lost �C" 

But the end of Mrs. Weasley's sentence was drowned in a general outcry. A thestral had just 

soared into sight and landed a few feet from them. Bill and Fleur slid from its back, windswept but 

unhurt. 

"Bill! Thank God, thank God �C" 

Mrs. Weasley ran forward, but the hug Bill bestowed upon her was perfunctory. Looking 
directly at his father, he said, "Mad-Eye's dead." 

Nobody spoke, nobody moved. Harry felt as though something inside him was falling, falling 
through the earth, leaving him forever. 

"We saw it," said Bill; Fleur nodded, tear tracks glittering on her cheeks in the light from the 
kitchen window. "It happened just after we broke out of the circle, Mad-Eye and Dung were close 
by us, they were heading north too. Voldemort �C he can fly �C went straight for them. Dung 
panicked, I heard him cry out, Mad-Eye tried to stop him, but he Disapparated. Voldemort's curse 
hit Mad-Eye full in the face, he fell backward off his broom and �C there was nothing we could do, 
nothing, we had half a dozen of them on our own tail �C" 

Bill's voice broke. 

"Of course you couldn't have done anything," said Lupin. 

They all stood looking at each other. Harry could not quite comprehend it. Mad-Eye dead; it 
could not be ... Mad-Eye, so tough, so brave, the consummate survivor... 

At last it seemed to dawn on everyone, though nobody said it, that there was no point of waiting 
in the yard anymore, and in silence they followed Mr. And Mrs. Weasley back into the Burrow,

��56ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and into the living room, where Fred and George were laughing together. 

"What's wrong?" said Fred, scanning their faces as they entered, "What's happened? Who's -?" 

"Mad-Eye," said Mr. Weasley, "Dead." 

The twins' grins turned to grimaces of shock. Nobody seemed to know what to do. Tonks was 
crying silently into a handkerchief, she had been close to Mad-Eye, Harry knew, his favorite and 
his prot��g��e at the Ministry of Magic. Hagrid, who had sat down on the floor in the corner where 
he had most space, was dabbing at his eyes with his tablecloth-sized handkerchief. 

Bill walked over to the sideboard and pulled out a bottle of fire-whisky and some glasses. 

"Here," he said, and with a wave of his wand, he sent twelve full glasses soaring through the 
room to each of them, holding the thirteenth aloft. "Mad-Eye." 

"Mad-Eye," they all said, and drank. 

"Mad-Eye," echoed Hagrid, a little late, with a hiccup. The firewhisky seared Harry's throat. It 

seemed to burn feeling back into him, dispelling the numbness and sense of unreality, firing him 

with something that was like courage. 

"So Mundungus disappeared?" said Lupin, who had drained his own glass in one. 

The atmosphere changed at once. Everybody looked tense, watching Lupin, both wanting him to 

go on, it seemed to Harry, and slightly afraid of what they might hear. 

"I know what you're thinking," said Bill, "and I wondered that too, on the way back here, 
because they seemed to be expecting us, didn't they? But Mundungus can't have betrayed us. They 
didn't know there would be seven Harrys, that confused them the moment we appeared, and in case 
you've forgotten, it was Mundungus who suggested that little bit of skullduggery (deception, 
trickery). Why wouldn't he have told them the essential point? I think Dung panicked, it's as simple 
as that. He didn't want to come in the first place, but Mad-Eye made him, and You-Know-Who 
went straight for them. It was enough to make anyone panic." 

"You-Know-Who acted exactly as Mad-Eye expected him to," sniffed Tonks. "Mad-Eye said 
he'd expect the real Harry to be with the toughest, most skilled Aurors. He chased Mad-Eye first, 
and when Mundungus gave them away he switched to Kingsley." 

"Yes, and zat eez all very good," snapped Fleur, "but still eet does not explain 'ow zey know we 
were moving 'Arry tonight, does eet? Somebody must 'ave been careless. Somebody let slip ze date 
to an outsider. It is ze only explanation for zem knowing ze date but not ze 'ole plan."

She glared around at them all, tear tracks still etched on her beautiful face, silently daring any of 
them to contradict her. Nobody did. The only sound to break the silence was that of Hagrid 
hiccupping from behind his handkerchief. Harry glanced at Hagrid, who had just risked his own 
life to save Harry's �C Hagrid, whom he loved, whom he trusted, who had once been tricked into 
giving Voldemort crucial information in exchange for a dragon's egg. 

"No," Harry said aloud, and they all looked at him, surprised, The firewhisky seemed to have 
amplified his voice. "I mean ... if somebody made a mistake," Harry went on, "and let something 
slip, I know they didn't mean to do it. It's not their fault," he repeated, again a little louder than he 
would usually have spoken. "We've got to trust each other. I trust all of you, I don't think anyone in 
this room would ever sell me to Voldemort." 

More silence followed his words. They were all looking at him; Harry felt a little hot again, and 
drank some more firewhisky for something to do. As he drank, he thought of Mad-Eye. Mad-Eye 
had always been scathing about Dumbledore's willingness to trust people. 

"Well said, Harry," said Fred unexpectedly. 

"Year, 'ear, 'ear," said George, with half a glance at Fred, the corner of whose mouth twitched. 

Lupin was wearing an odd expression as he looked at Harry. It was close to pitying. 

"You think I'm a fool?" demanded Harry. 

"No, I think you're like James," said Lupin, "who would have regarded it as the height of 
dishonor to mistrust his friends." 

Harry knew what Lupin was getting at, that his father had been betrayed by his friend Peter 
Pettigrew. He felt irrationally angry. He wanted to argue, but Lupin had turned away from him, set 
down his glass upon a side table, and addressed Bill, "There's work to do. I can ask Kingsley 
whether �C" 

"No," said Bill at once, "I'll do it, I'll come." 

"Where are you going?" said Tonks and Fleur together. 

"Mad-Eye's body," said Lupin. "We need to recover it." 

"Can't it -?" began Mrs. Weasley with an appealing look at Bill. 

"Wait?" said Bill, "Not unless you'd rather the Death Eaters took it?" 

Nobody spoke. Lupin and Bill said goodbye and left. 

The rest of them now dropped into chairs, all except for Harry, who remained standing. The

��58ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

suddenness and completeness of death was with them like a presence. 

"I've got to go too," said Harry. 

Ten pairs of startled eyes looked at him. 

"Don't be silly, Harry," said Mrs. Weasley, "What are you talking about?" 

"I can't stay here." 

He rubbed his forehead; it was prickling again, he had not hurt like this for more than a year. 

"You're all in danger while I'm here. I don't want �C" 

"But don't be so silly!" said Mrs. Weasley. "The whole point of tonight was to get you here 

safely, and thank goodness it worked. And Fleur's agreed to get married here rather than in France, 

we've arranged everything so that we can all stay together and look after you �C" 

She did not understand; she was making him feel worse, not better. 

"If Voldemort finds out I'm here �C" 

"But why should he?" asked Mrs. Weasley. 

"There are a dozen places you might be now, Harry," said Mr. Weasley. "He's got no way of 

knowing which safe house you're in." 

"It's not me I'm worried for!" said Harry. 

"We know that," said Mr. Weasley quietly, "but it would make our efforts tonight seem rather 
pointless if you left." 

"Yer not goin' anywhere," growled Hagrid. "Blimey, Harry, after all we wen' through ter get you 
here?" 

"Yeah, what about my bleeding ear?" said George, hoisting himself up on his cushions. 

"I know that �C" 

"Mad-Eye wouldn't want �C" 

"I KNOW!" Harry bellowed. 

He felt beleaguered and blackmailed, did they think he did not know what they had done for 
him, didn't they understand that it was for precisely that reason that he wanted to go now, before 
they had to suffer any more on his behalf? There was a long and awkward silence in which his scar 
continued to prickle and throb, and which was broken at last by Mrs. Weasley. 

"Where's Hedwig, Harry?" she said coaxingly. "We can put her up with Pigwidgeon and give 
her something to eat."

��59ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

His insides clenched like a fist. He could not tell her the truth. He drank the last of his 
firewhisky to avoid answering. 

"Wait till it gets out yeh did it again, Harry," said Hagrid. "Escaped him, fought him off when he 
was right on top of yeh!" 

"It wasn't me," said Harry flatly. "It was my wand. My wand acted of its own accord." 

After a few moments, Hermione said gently, "But that's impossible, Harry. You mean that you 

did magic without meaning to; you reacted instinctively." 

"No," said Harry. "The bike was falling, I couldn't have told you where Voldemort was, but my 
wand spun in my hand and found him and shot a spell at him, and it wasn't even a spell I 
recognized. I've never made gold flames appear before." 

"Often," said Mr. Weasley, "when you're in a pressured situation you can produce magic you 
never dreamed of. Small children often find, before they're trained �C" 

"It wasn't like that," said Harry through gritted teeth. His scar was burning. He felt angry and 
frustrated; he hated the idea that they were all imagining him to have power to match Voldemort's. 

No one said anything. He knew that they did not believe him. Now that he came to think of it, 
he had never heard of a wand performing magic on its own before. 

His scar seared with pain, it was all he could do not to moan aloud. Muttering about fresh air, he 
set down his glass and left the room. 

As he crossed the yard, the great skeletal thestral looked up �C rustled its enormous batlike wings, 
then resumed its grazing. Harry stopped at the gate into the garden, staring out at its overgrown 
plants, rubbing his pounding forehead and thinking of Dumbledore. 

Dumbledore would have believed him, he knew it. Dumbledore would have known how and 
why Harry's wand had acted independently, because Dumbledore always had the answers; he had 
known about wands, had explained to Harry the strange connection that existed between his wand 
and Voldemort's. But Dumbledore, like Mad-Eye, like Sirius, like his parents, like his poor owl, all 
were gone where Harry could never talk to them again. He felt a burning in his throat that had 
nothing to do with firewhisky. 

And then, out of nowhere, the pain in his scar peaked. As he clutched his forehead and closed 
his eyes, a voice screamed inside his head. 

"You told me the problem would be solved by using another's wand!" 

��60ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

And into his mind burst the vision of an emaciated [i'me...e.t] old man lying in rags upon a 

stone floor, screaming, a horrible drawn-out scream, a scream of unendurable agony... 

"No! No! I beg you, I beg you ...�� 

"You lied to Lord Voldemort, Ollivander!" 

"I did not... I swear I did not... " 

"You sought to help Potter, to help him escape me!" 

"I swear I did not... I believed a different wand would work." 

"Explain, then, what happened. Lucius's wand is destroyed!" 

"I cannot understand... The connection ... exists only between your two wands." 

"Lies!" 

"Please ... I beg you... " 

And Harry saw the white hand raise its wand and felt Voldemort's surge of vicious anger, saw 

the frail old main on the floor writhe in agony �C 

"Harry?" 

It was over as quickly as it had come, Harry stood shaking in the darkness, clutching the gate 

into the garden, his heart racing, his scar still tingling. It was several moments before he realized 

that Ron and Hermione were at his side. 

"Harry, come back in the house," Hermione whispered, "You aren't still thinking of leaving?" 

"Yeah, you've got to stay, mate," said Ron, thumping Harry on the back. 

"Are you all right?" Hermione asked, close enough now to look into Harry's face. "You look 

awful!" 

"Well," said Harry shakily, "I probably look better than Ollivander...�� 

When he had finished telling them what he had seen, Ron looked appalled, but Hermione 
downright terrified. 

"But it was supposed to have stopped! Your scar �C it wasn't supposed to do this anymore! You 
mustn't let that connection open up again �C Dumbledore wanted you to close your mind!" 

When he did not reply, she gripped his arm. 

"Harry, he's taking over the Ministry and the newspapers and half the Wizarding world! Don't 

let him inside your head too!"

Chapter Six 

The Ghoul in Pajamas 

The shock of losing Mad-Eye hung over the 


house in the 
days that followed. Harry kept expecting to see him 

stumping in 
through the back door like the other Order 

members, 
who passed in and out to relay news. Harry felt that 

nothing but 
action would assuage his feelings of guilt and grief and that he ought to set out on his mission to 
find and destroy Horcruxes as soon as possible. 

��Well, you can��t do anything about the�� �C Ron mouthed the word Horcruxes �C ��till you��re 
seventeen. You��ve still got the Trace on you. And we can plan here as well as anywhere, can��t we? 
Or,�� he dropped his voice to a whisper, ��d��you reckon you already know where the You-Know-
Whats are?�� 

��No,�� Harry admitted. 

��I think Hermione��s been doing a bit of research,�� said Ron. ��She said she was saving it for 
when you got here.�� 

They were sitting at the breakfast table; Mr. Weasley and Bill had just left for work. Mrs. 
Weasley had gone upstairs to wake Hermione and Ginny, while Fleur had drifted off to take a bath. 

��The Trace��ll break on the thirty-first,�� said Harry. ��That means I only need to stay here four 
days. Then I can �C�� 

��Five days,�� Ron corrected him firmly. ��We��ve got to stay for the wedding. They��ll kill us if we 
miss it.�� 

Harry understood ��they�� to mean Fleur and Mrs. Weasley. 

��It��s one extra day,�� said Ron, when Harry looked mutinous. 

��Don��t they realize how important �C?�� 

����Course they don��t,�� said Ron. ��They haven��t got a clue. And now you mention it, I wanted to 
talk to you about that.�� 

Ron glanced toward the door into the hall to check that Mrs. Weasley was not returning yet, then 
leaned in closer to Harry. 

��Mum��s been trying to get it out of Hermione and me. What we��re off to do. She��ll try you next,

��62ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

so brace yourself. Dad and Lupin��ve both asked as well, but when we said Dumbledore told you 
not to tell anyone except us, they dropped it. Not Mum, though. She��s determined.�� 

Ron��s prediction came true within hours. Shortly before lunch, Mrs. Weasley detached Harry 
from the others by asking him to help identify a lone man��s sock that she thought might have come 
out of his rucksack. Once she had him cornered in the tiny scullery (area or room for washing 
dishes and performing messy tasks (British��ϴ��) off the kitchen, she started. 

��Ron and Hermione seem to think that the three of you are dropping out of Hogwarts,�� she 
began in a light, casual tone. 

��Oh,�� said Harry. ��Well, yeah. We are.�� 

The mangle���»� turned of its own accord in a corner, wringing out what looked like one of 
Mr. Weasley��s vests. 

��May I ask why you are abandoning your education?�� said Mrs. Weasley. 

��Well, Dumbledore left me ... stuff to do,�� mumbled Harry. ��Ron and Hermione know about it, 

and they want to come too.�� 

��What sort of 'stuf��'?�� 

��I��m sorry, I can��t �C�� 

��Well, frankly, I think Arthur and I have a right to know, and I��m sure Mr. And Mrs. Granger 

would agree!�� said Mrs. Weasley. 

Harry had been afraid of the ��concerned parent�� attack. He forced himself to look directly into 
her eyes, noticing as he did so that they were precisely the same shade of brown as Ginny��s. This 
did not help. 

��Dumbledore didn��t want anyone else to know, Mrs. Weasley. I��m sorry. Ron and Hermione 
don��t have to come, it��s their choice -�� 

��I don��t see that you have to go either!�� she snapped, dropping all pretense now. ��You��re barely 
of age, any of you! It��s utter nonsense, if Dumbledore needed work doing, he had the whole Order 
at his command! Harry, you must have misunderstood him. Probably he was telling you something 
he wanted done, and you took it to mean that he wanted you �C�� 

��I didn��t misunderstand,�� said Harry flatly. ��It��s got to be me.�� He handed her back the single 
sock he was supposed to be identifying, which was patterned with golden bulrushes. ��And that��s 
not mine. I don��t support Puddlemere United.��

��63ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Oh, of course not,�� said Mrs. Weasley with a sudden and rather unnerving return to her casual 
tone. ��I should have realized. Well, Harry, while we��ve still got you here, you won��t mind helping 
with the preparations for Bill and Fleur��s wedding, will you? There��s still so much to do.�� 

��No �C I �C of course not,�� said Harry, disconcerted by this sudden change of subject. 

��Sweet of you,�� she replied, and she smiled as she left the scullery. 

From that moment on, Mrs. Weasley kept Harry, Ron and Hermione so busy with preparations 
for the wedding that they hardly had any time to think. The kindest explanation of this behavior 
would have been that Mrs. Weasley wanted to distract them all from thoughts of Mad-Eye and the 
terrors of their recent journey. 

After two days of nonstop cutlery cleaning, of color-matching favors, ribbons and flowers, of 
de-gnoming the garden and helping Mrs. Weasley cook vast batches of canap��s, however, Harry 
started to suspect her of a different motive. All the jobs she handed out seemed to keep him, Ron, 
and Hermione away from one another; he had not had a chance to speak to the two of them alone 
since the first night, when he had told them about Voldemort torturing Ollivander. 

��I think Mum thinks that if she can stop the three of you getting together and planning, she��ll be 
able to delay you leaving,�� Ginny told Harry in an undertone, as they laid the table for dinner on 
the third night of his stay. 

��And then what does she think��s going to happen?�� Harry muttered. ��Someone else might kill 

off Voldemort while she��s holding us here making vol-au-vents?�� 

He had spoken without thinking, and saw Ginny��s face whiten. 

��So it��s true?�� she said. ��That��s what you��re trying to do?�� 

��I �C not �C I was joking,�� said Harry evasively. 

They stared at each other, and there was something more than shock in Ginny��s expression. 
Suddenly Harry became aware that this was the first time that he had been alone with her since 
those stolen hours in secluded corners of the Hogwarts grounds. He was sure she was remembering 
them too. Both of them jumped as the door opened, and Mr. Weasley, Kingsley, and Bill walked 
in. 

They were often joined by other Order members for dinner now, because the Burrow had 
replaced number twelve, Grimmauld Place as the headquarters. Mr. Weasley had explained that 
after the death of Dumbledore, their Secret-Keeper, each of the people to whom Dumbledore had

��64ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

confided Grimmauld Place��s location had become a Secret-Keeper in turn. 

��And as there are around twenty of us, that greatly dilutes the power of the Fidelius Charm. 
Twenty times as many opportunities for the Death Eaters to get the secret out of somebody. We 
can��t expect it to hold much longer.�� 

��But surely Snape will have told the Death Eaters the address by now?�� asked Harry. 

��Well, Mad-Eye set up a couple of curses against Snape in case he turns up there again. We 
hope they��ll be strong enough both to keep him out and to bind his tongue if he tries to talk about 
the place, but we can��t be sure. It would have been insane to keep using the place as headquarters 
now that its protection has become so shaky.�� 

The kitchen was so crowded that evening it was difficult to maneuver knives and forks. Harry 
found himself crammed beside Ginny; the unsaid things that had just passed between them made 
him wish they had been separated by a few more people. He was trying so hard to avoid brushing 
her arm he could barely cut his chicken. 

��No news about Mad-Eye?�� Harry asked Bill. 

��Nothing,�� replied Bill. 

They had not been able to hold a funeral for Moody, because Bill and Lupin had failed to 
recover his body. It had been difficult to know where he might have fallen, given the darkness and 
the confusion of the battle. 

��The Daily Prophet hasn��t said a word about him dying or about finding the body,�� Bill went 
on. ��But that doesn��t mean much. It��s keeping a lot quiet these days.�� 

��And they still haven��t called a hearing about all the underage magic I used escaping the Death 
Eaters?�� Harry called across the table to Mr. Weasley, who shook his head. 

��Because they know I had no choice or because they don��t want me to tell the world Voldemort 
attacked me?�� 

��The latter, I think. Scrimgeour doesn��t want to admit that You-Know-Who is as powerful as he 
is, nor that Azkaban��s seen a mass breakout.�� 

��Yeah, why tell the public the truth?�� said Harry, clenching his knife so tightly that the faint 
scars on the back of his right hand stood out, white against his skin, I must not tell lies. 

��Isn��t anyone at the Ministry prepared to stand up to him?�� asked Ron angrily. 

��Of course, Ron, but people are terrified,�� Mr. Weasley replied, ��terrified that they will be next

��65ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to disappear, their children the next to be attacked! There are nasty rumors going around; I for one 
don��t believe the Muggle Studies professor at Hogwarts resigned. She hasn��t been seen for weeks 
now. Meanwhile Scrimgeour remains shut up in his office all day; I just hope he��s working on a 
plan.�� 

There was a pause in which Mrs. Weasley magicked the empty plates onto the work surface and 
served apple tart. 

��We must decide 'ow you will be disguised, 'Arry,�� said Fleur, once everyone had pudding. ��For 
ze wedding,�� she added, when he looked confused. ��Of course, none of our guests are Death 
Eaters, but we cannot guarantee zat zey will not let something slip after zey 'ave 'ad champagne.�� 

From this, Harry gathered that she still suspected Hagrid. 

��Yes, good point,�� said Mrs. Weasley from the top of the table where she sat, spectacles perched 
on the end of her nose, scanning an immense list of jobs that she had scribbled on a very long piece 
of parchment. ��Now, Ron, have you cleaned out your room yet?�� 

��Why?�� exclaimed Ron, slamming his spoon down and glaring at his mother. ��Why does my 

room have to be cleaned out? Harry and I are fine with it the way it is!�� 

��We are holding your brother��s wedding here in a few days�� time, young man �C�� 

��And are they getting married in my bedroom?�� asked Ron furiously. ��No! So why in the name 

of Merlin��s saggy left �C�� 

��Don��t talk to your mother like that,�� said Mr. Weasley firmly. ��And do as you��re told.�� 

Ron scowled at both his parents, then picked up his spoon and attacked the last few mouthfuls of 

his apple tart. 

��I can help, some of it��s my mess.�� Harry told Ron, but Mrs. Weasley cut across him. 

��No, Harry, dear, I��d much rather you helped Arthur muck out (clean out the mud or filth (i.e. 
from a barn, mine, etc.) the chickens, and Hermione, I��d be ever so grateful if you��d change the 
sheets for Monsieur and Madame Delacour; you know they��re arriving at eleven tomorrow 
morning.�� 

But as it turned out, there was very little to do for the chickens. ��There��s no need to, er, mention 
it to Molly,�� Mr. Weasley told Harry, blocking his access to the coop, ��but, er, Ted Tonks sent me 
most of what was left of Sirius��s bike and, er, I��m hiding �C that��s to say, keeping �C it in here. 
Fantastic stuff, There��s an exhaust gaskin, as I believe it��s called, the most magnificent battery, and

it��ll be a great opportunity to find out how brakes work. I��m going to try and put it all back 
together again when Molly��s not �C I mean, when I��ve got time.�� 

When they returned to the house, Mrs. Weasley was nowhere to be seen, so Harry slipped 
upstairs to Ron��s attic bedroom. 

��I��m doing it, I��m doing �C ! Oh, it��s you,�� said Ron in relief, as Harry entered the room. Ron lay 
back down on the bed, which he had evidently just vacated. The room was just as messy as it had 
been all week; the only change was that Hermione was now sitting in the far corner, her fluffy 
ginger cat, Crookshanks, at her feet, sorting books, some of which Harry recognized as his own, 
into two enormous piles. 

��Hi, Harry,�� she said, as he sat down on his camp bed. 

��And how did you manage to get away?�� 

��Oh, Ron��s mum forgot that she asked Ginny and me to change the sheets yesterday,�� said 

Hermione. She threw Numerology and Grammatica onto one pile and The Rise and Fall of the 

Dark Arts onto the other. 

��We were just talking about Mad-Eye,�� Ron told Harry. ��I reckon he might have survived.�� 

��But Bill saw him hit by the Killing Curse,�� said Harry. 

��Yeah, but Bill was under attack too,�� said Ron. ��How can he be sure what he saw?�� 

��Even if the Killing Curse missed, Mad-Eye still fell about a thousand feet,�� said Hermione, 

now weighing Quidditch Teams of Britain and Ireland in her hand. 

��He could have used a Shield Charm �C�� 

��Fleur said his wand was blasted out of his hand,�� said Harry. 

��Well, all right, if you want him to be dead,�� said Ron grumpily, punching his pillow into a 
more comfortable shape. 

��Of course we don��t want him to be dead!�� said Hermione, looking shocked. ��It��s dreadful that 
he��s dead! But we��re being realistic!�� 

For the first time, Harry imagined Mad-Eye��s body, broken as Dumbledore��s had been, yet with 
that one eye still whizzing in its socket. He felt a stab of revulsion mixed with a bizarre desire to 
laugh. 

��The Death Eaters probably tidied up after themselves, that��s why no one��s found him,�� said 
Ron wisely.

��67ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Yeah,�� said Harry. ��Like Barty Crouch, turned into a bone and buried in Hagrid��s front garden. 
They probably transfigured Moody and stuffed him �C�� 

��Don��t!�� squealed Hermione. Startled, Harry looked over just in time to see her burst into tears 
over her copy of Spellman��s Syllabary. 

��Oh no,�� said Harry, struggling to get up from the old camp bed. ��Hermione, I wasn��t trying to 
upset �C�� 

But with a great creaking of rusty bedsprings, Ron bounded off the bed and got there first. One 
arm around Hermione, he fished in his jeans pocket and withdrew a revolting-looking 
handkerchief that he had used to clean out the oven earlier. Hastily pulling out his wand, he 
pointed it at the rag and said, ��Tergeo.�� 

The wand siphoned off most of the grease. Looking rather pleased with himself, Ron handed the 
slightly smoking handkerchief to Hermione. 

��Oh ... thanks, Ron... I��m sorry... �� She blew her nose and hiccupped. ��It��s just so awf-ful, isn��t 
it? R-right after Dumbledore ... I j-just n-never imagined Mad-Eye dying, somehow, he seemed so 
tough!�� 

��Yeah, I know,�� said Ron, giving her a squeeze. ��But you know what he��d say to us if he was 

here?�� 

����C-constant vigilance,���� said Hermione, mopping her eyes. 

��That��s right,�� said Ron, nodding. ��He��d tell us to learn from what happened to him. And what 

I��ve learned is not to trust that cowardly little squit, Mundungus.�� 

Hermione gave a shaky laugh and leaned forward to pick up two more books. A second later, 
Ron had snatched his arm back from around her shoulders, she had dropped The Monster of 
Monsters on his foot. The book had broken free from its restraining belt and snapped viciously at 
Ron��s ankle. 

��I��m sorry, I��m sorry!�� Hermione cried as Harry wrenched the book from Ron��s leg and retied it 

shut. 

��What are you doing with all those books anyway?�� Ron asked, limping back to his bed. 

��Just trying to decide which ones to take with us,�� said Hermione, ��When we��re looking for the 
Horcruxes.�� 

��Oh, of course,�� said Ron, clapping a hand to his forehead. ��I forgot we��ll be hunting down

��68ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Voldemort in a mobile library.�� 

��Ha ha,�� said Hermione, looking down at Spellman��s Syllabary. ��I wonder ... will we need to 
translate runes? It��s possible... I think we��d better take it, to be safe.�� 

She dropped the syllabary onto the larger of the two piles and picked up Hogwarts, A History. 

��Listen,�� said Harry. He had sat up straight. 

Ron and Hermione looked at him with similar mixtures of resignation and defiance. 

��I know you said after Dumbledore��s funeral that you wanted to come with me,�� Harry began. 

��Here he goes,�� Ron said to Hermione, rolling his eyes. 

��As we knew he would,�� she sighed, turning back to the books. ��You know, I think I will take 

Hogwarts, A History. Even if we��re not going back there, I don��t think I��d feel right if I didn��t have 

it with �C�� 

��Listen!�� said Harry again. 

��No, Harry, you listen,�� said Hermione. ��We��re coming with you. That was decided months ago 

�C years, really.�� 
��But �C�� 
��Shut up,�� Ron advised him. 
���C are you sure you��ve thought this through?�� Harry persisted. 
��Let��s see,�� said Hermione, slamming Travels with Trolls onto the discarded pile with a rather 
fierce look. ��I��ve been packing for days, so we��re ready to leave at a moment��s notice, which for 
your information has included doing some pretty difficult magic, not to mention smuggling MadEye��s 
whole stock of Polyjuice Potion right under Ron��s mum��s nose. 

��I��ve also modified my parents�� memories so that they��re convinced they��re really called 
Wendell and Monica Wilkins, and that their life��s ambition is to move to Australia, which they 
have now done. That��s to make it more difficult for Voldemort to track them down and interrogate 
them about me �C or you, because unfortunately, I��ve told them quite a bit about you. 

��Assuming I survive our hunt for the Horcruxes, I��ll find Mum and Dad and lift the 
enchantment. If I don��t �C well, I think I��ve cast a good enough charm to keep them safe and happy. 
Wendell and Monica Wilkins don��t know that they��ve got a daughter, you see.�� 

Hermione��s eyes were swimming with tears again. Ron got back off the bed, put his arm around 
her once more, and frowned at Harry as though reproaching him for lack of tact. Harry could not

��69ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

think of anything to say, not least because it was highly unusual for Ron to be teaching anyone else 

tact. 

��I �C Hermione, I��m sorry �C I didn��t �C�� 

��Didn��t realize that Ron and I know perfectly well what might happen if we come with you? 

Well, we do. Ron, show Harry what you��ve done.�� 

��Nah, he��s just eaten,�� said Ron. 

��Go on, he needs to know!�� 

��Oh, all right. Harry, come here.�� 

For the second time Ron withdrew his arm from around Hermione and stumped over to the 

door. 

��C��mon.�� 

��Why?�� Harry asked, following Ron out of the room onto the tiny landing. 

��Descendo,�� muttered Ron, pointing his wand at the low ceiling. A hatch opened right over their 
heads and a ladder slid down to their feet. A horrible, half-sucking, half-moaning sound came out 
of the square hole, along with an unpleasant smell like open drains. 

��That��s your ghoul, isn��t it?�� asked Harry, who had never actually met the creature that 
sometimes disrupted the nightly silence. 

��Yeah, it is,�� said Ron, climbing the ladder. ��Come and have a look at him.�� 

Harry followed Ron up the few short steps into the tiny attic space. His head and shoulders were 

in the room before he caught sight of the creature curled up a few feet from him, fast asleep in the 

gloom with its large mouth wide open. 

��But it ... it looks ... do ghouls normally wear pajamas?�� 

��No,�� said Ron. ��Nor have they usually got red hair or that number of pustulesŧ��.�� 

Harry contemplated the thing, slightly revolted. It was human in shape and size, and was 
wearing what, now that Harry��s eyes became used to the darkness, was clearly an old pair of Ron��s 
pajamas. He was also sure that ghouls were generally rather slimy and bald, rather than distinctly 
hairy and covered in angry purple blisters. 

��He��s me, see?�� said Ron. 

��No,�� said Harry. ��I don��t.�� 

��I��ll explain it back in my room, the smell��s getting to me,�� said Ron. They climbed back down

��70ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the ladder, which Ron returned to the ceiling, and rejoined Hermione, who was still sorting books. 

��Once we��ve left, the ghoul��s going to come and live down here in my room,�� said Ron. ��I think 
he��s really looking forward to it �C well, it��s hard to tell, because all he can do is moan and drool �C 
but he nods a lot when you mention it. Anyway, he��s going to be me with spattergroit. Good, eh?�� 

Harry merely looked his confusion. 

��It is!�� said Ron, clearly frustrated that Harry had not grasped the brilliance of the plan. ��Look, 
when we three don��t turn up at Hogwarts again, everyone��s going to think Hermione and I must be 
with you, right? Which means the Death Eaters will go straight for our families to see if they��ve 
got information on where you are.�� 

��But hopefully it��ll look like I��ve gone away with Mum and Dad; a lot of Muggle-borns are 
talking about going into hiding at the moment,�� said Hermione. 

��We can��t hide my whole family, it��ll look too fishy and they can��t all leave their jobs,�� said 
Ron. ��So we��re going to put out the story that I��m seriously ill with spattergroit, which is why I 
can��t go back to school. If anyone comes calling to investigate, Mum or Dad can show them the 
ghoul in my bed, covered in pustules. Spattergroit��s really contagious, so they��re not going to want 
to go near him. It won��t matter that he can��t say anything, either, because apparently you can��t 
once the fungus has spread to your uvulaС��.�� 

��And your mum and dad are in on this plan?�� asked Harry. 

��Dad is. He helped Fred and George transform the ghoul. Mum ... well, you��ve seen what she��s 
like. She won��t accept we��re going till we��re gone.�� 

There was silence in the room, broken only by gentle thuds as Hermione continued to throw 
books onto one pile or the other. Ron sat watching her, and Harry looked from one to the other, 
unable to say anything. The measure they had taken to protect their families made him realize, 
more than anything else could have done, that they really were going to come with him and that 
they knew exactly how dangerous that would be. He wanted to tell them what that meant to him, 
but he simply could not find words important enough. 

Through the silence came the muffled sounds of Mrs. Weasley shouting from four floors below. 

��Ginny��s probably left a speck of dust on a poxy napkin ring,�� said Ron. ��I dunno why the 
Delacours have got to come two days before the wedding.�� 

��Fleur��s sister��s a bridesmaid, she needs to be here for the rehearsal, and she��s too young to

542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

come on her own,�� said Hermione, as she pored indecisively over Break with a Banshee. 

��Well, guests aren��t going to help Mum��s stress levels,�� said Ron. 

��What we really need to decide,�� said Hermione, tossing Defensive Magical Theory into the bin 
without a second glance and picking up An Appraisal of Magical Education in Europe, ��is where 
we��re going after we leave here. I know you said you wanted to go to Godric��s Hollow first, Harry, 
and I understand why, but ... well ... shouldn��t we make the Horcruxes our priority?�� 

��If we knew where any of the Horcruxes were, I��d agree with you,�� said Harry, who did not 
believe that Hermione really understood his desire to return to Godric��s Hollow. His parents�� 
graves were only part of the attraction, He had a strong, though inexplicable, feeling that the place 
held answers for him. Perhaps it was simply because it was there that he had survived Voldemort��s 
Killing Curse; now that he was facing the challenge of repeating the feat, Harry was drawn to the 
place where it had happened, wanting to understand. 

��Don��t you think there��s a possibility that Voldemort��s keeping a watch on Godric��s Hollow?�� 
Hermione asked. ��He might expect you to go back and visit your parents�� graves once you��re free 
to go wherever you like?�� 

This had not occurred to Harry. While he struggled to find a counterargument, Ron spoke up, 

evidently following his own train of thought. 

��This R.A.B. person,�� he said. ��You know, the one who stole the real locket?�� 

Hermione nodded. 

��He said in his note he was going to destroy it, didn��t he?�� 

Harry dragged his rucksack toward him and pulled out the fake Horcrux in which R.A.B.��s note 

was still folded. 

����I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as I can.���� Harry read out. 

��Well, what if he did finish it off?�� said Ron. 

��Or she.�� Interposed Hermione. 

��Whichever,�� said Ron. ��it��d be one less for us to do!�� 

��Yes, but we��re still going to have to try and trace the real locket, aren��t we?�� said Hermione, 

��to find out whether or not it��s destroyed.�� 

��And once we get hold of it, how do you destroy a Horcrux?�� asked Ron. 

��Well,�� said Hermione, ��I��ve been researching that.��

��72ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��How?�� asked Harry. ��I didn��t think there were any books on Horcruxes in the library?�� 

��There weren��t,�� said Hermione, who had turned pink. ��Dumbledore removed them all, but he �C 
he didn��t destroy them.�� 

Ron sat up straight, wide-eyed. ��How in the name of Merlin��s pants have you managed to get 
your hands on those Horcrux books?�� 

��It �C it wasn��t stealing!�� said Hermione, looking from Harry to Ron with a kind of desperation. 
��They were still library books, even if Dumbledore had taken them off the shelves. Anyway, if he 
really didn��t want anyone to get at them, I��m sure he would have made it much harder to �C�� 

��Get to the point!�� said Ron. 

��Well ... it was easy,�� said Hermione in a small voice. ��I just did a Summoning Charm. You 
know �C Accio. And �C they zoomed out of Dumbledore��s study window right into the girls�� 
dormitory.�� 

��But when did you do this?�� Harry asked, regarding Hermione with a mixture of admiration and 
incredulity. 

��Just after his �C Dumbledore��s �C funeral,�� said Hermione in an even smaller voice. ��Right after 
we agreed we��d leave school and go and look for the Horcruxes. When I went back upstairs to get 
my things it ... it just occurred to me that the more we knew about them, the better it would be ... 
and I was alone in there ... so I tried ... and it worked. They flew straight in through the open 
window and I �C I packed them.�� 

She swallowed and then said imploringly, ��I can��t believe Dumbledore would have been angry, 

it��s not as though we��re going to use the information to make a Horcrux, is it?�� 

��Can you hear us complaining?�� said Ron. ��Where are these books anyway?�� 

Hermione rummaged for a moment and then extracted from the pile a large volume, bound in 
faded black leather. She looked a little nauseated and held it as gingerly as if it were something 
recently dead. 

��This is the one that gives explicit instructions on how to make a Horcrux. Secrets of the 
Darkest Art �C it��s a horrible book, really awful, full of evil magic. I wonder when Dumbledore 
removed it from the library... if he didn��t do it until he was headmaster, I bet Voldemort got all the 
instruction he needed from here.�� 

��Why did he have to ask Slughorn how to make a Horcrux, then, if he��d already read that?��

��73ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

asked Ron. 

��He only approached Slughorn to find out what would happen if you split your soul into seven,�� 
said Harry. ��Dumbledore was sure Riddle already knew how to make a Horcrux by the time he 
asked Slughorn about them. I think you��re right, Hermione, that could easily have been where he 
got the information.�� 

��And the more I��ve read about them,�� said Hermione, ��the more horrible they seem, and the less 
I can believe that he actually made six. It warns in this book how unstable you make the rest of 
your soul by ripping it, and that��s just by making one Horcrux!�� 

Harry remembered what Dumbledore had said about Voldemort moving beyond ��usual evil.�� 

��Isn��t there any way of putting yourself back together?�� Ron asked. 

��Yes,�� said Hermione with a hollow smile, ��but it would be excruciatingly painful.�� 

��Why? How do you do it?�� asked Harry. 

��Remorse,�� said Hermione. ��You��ve got to really feel what you��ve done. There��s a footnote. 
Apparently the pain of it can destroy you. I can��t see Voldemort attempting it somehow, can you?�� 

��No,�� said Ron, before Harry could answer. ��So does it say how to destroy Horcruxes in that 
book?�� 

��Yes,�� said Hermione, now turning the fragile pages as if examining rotting entrails, ��because it 
warns Dark wizards how strong they have to make the enchantments on them. From all that I��ve 
read, what Harry did to Riddle��s diary was one of the few really foolproof ways of destroying a 
Horcrux.�� 

��What, stabbing it with a basilisk fang?�� asked Harry. 

��Oh well, lucky we��ve got such a large supply of basilisk fangs, then,�� said Ron. ��I was 
wondering what we were going to do with them.�� 

��It doesn��t have to be a basilisk fang,�� said Hermione patiently. ��It has to be something so 
destructive that the Horcrux can��t repair itself. Basilisk venom only has one antidote, and it��s 
incredibly rare �C�� 

���C phoenix tears,�� said Harry, nodding. 

��Exactly,�� said Hermione. ��Our problem is that there are very few substances as destructive as 
basilisk venom, and they��re all dangerous to carry around with you. That��s a problem we��re going 
to have to solve, though, because ripping, smashing, or crushing a Horcrux won��t do the trick.

��74ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

You��ve got to put it beyond magical repair.�� 

��But even if we wreck the thing it lives in,�� said Ron, ��why can��t the bit of soul in it just go and 
live in something else?�� 

��Because a Horcrux is the complete opposite of a human being.�� 

Seeing that Harry and Ron looked thoroughly confused, Hermione hurried on. ��Look, if I picked 

up a sword right now, Ron, and ran you through with it, I wouldn��t damage your soul at all.�� 

��Which would be a real comfort to me, I��m sure,�� said Ron. 

Harry laughed. 

��It should be, actually! But my point is that whatever happens to your body, your soul will 
survive, untouched,�� said Hermione. ��But it��s the other way round with a Horcrux. The fragment 
of soul inside it depends on its container, its enchanted body, for survival. It can��t exist without it.�� 

��That diary sort of died when I stabbed it,�� said Harry, remembering ink pouring like blood 
from the punctured pages, and the screams of the piece of Voldemort��s soul as it vanished. 

��And once the diary was properly destroyed, the bit of soul trapped in it could no longer exist. 
Ginny tried to get rid of the diary before you did, flushing it away, but obviously it came back 
good as new.�� 

��Hang on,�� said Ron, frowning. ��The bit of soul in that diary was possessing Ginny, wasn��t it? 
How does that work, then?�� 

��While the magical container is still intact, the bit of soul inside it can flit in and out of someone 
if they get too close to the object. I don��t mean holding it for too long, it��s nothing to do with 
touching it,�� she added before Ron could speak. ��I mean close emotionally. Ginny poured her 
heart out into that diary, she made herself incredibly vulnerable. You��re in trouble if you get too 
fond of or dependent on the Horcrux.�� 

��I wonder how Dumbledore destroyed the ring?�� said Harry. ��Why didn��t I ask him? I never 
really ...�� 

His voice trailed away, He was thinking of all the things he should have asked Dumbledore, and 
of how, since the headmaster had died, it seemed to Harry that he had wasted so many 
opportunities when Dumbledore had been alive, to find out more ... to find out everything ... 

The silence was shattered as the bedroom door flew open with a wall-shaking crash. Hermione 
shrieked and dropped Secrets of the Darkest Art; Crookshanks streaked under the bed, hissing

��75ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

indignantly; Ron jumped off the bed, skidded on a discarded Chocolate Frog wrapper, and 
smacked his head on the opposite wall; and Harry instinctively dived for his wand before realizing 
that he was looking up at Mrs. Weasley, whose hair was disheveled and whose face was contorted 
with rage. 

��I��m so sorry to break up this cozy little gathering,�� she said, her voice trembling. ��I��m sure you 
all need your rest ... but there are wedding presents stacked in my room that need sorting out and I 
was under the impression that you had agreed to help.�� 

��Oh yes,�� said Hermione, looking terrified as she leapt to her feet, sending books flying in every 
direction. ��we will ... we��re sorry ...�� 

With an anguished look at Harry and Ron, Hermione hurried out of the room after Mrs. 
Weasley. 

��It��s like being a house-elf,�� complained Ron in an undertone, still massaging his head as he and 
Harry followed. ��Except without the job satisfaction. The sooner this wedding��s over, the happier 
I��ll be.�� 

��Yeah,�� said Harry, ��then we��ll have nothing to do except find Horcruxes... It��ll be like a 
holiday, won��t it?�� 

Ron started to laugh, but, at the sight of the enormous pile of wedding presents waiting for them 
in Mrs. Weasley��s room, stopped quite abruptly. 

The Delacours arrived the following morning at eleven o�� clock. Harry, Ron, Hermione and 
Ginny were feeling quite resentful toward Fleur��s family by this time; and it was with ill grace that 
Ron stumped back upstairs to put on matching socks, and Harry attempted to flatten his hair. Once 
they had all been deemed smart enough, they trooped out into the sunny backyard to await the 
visitors. 

Harry had never seen the place looking so tidy. The rusty cauldrons and old Wellington boots 
that usually littered the steps by the back door were gone, replaced by two new Flutterby bushes 
standing either side of the door in large pots; though there was no breeze, the leaves waved lazily, 
giving an attractive rippling effect. The chickens had been shut away, the yard had been swept, and 
the nearby garden had been pruned, plucked, and generally spruced up, although Harry, who liked 
it in its overgrown state, thought that it looked rather forlorn without its usual contingent (group) 
of capering gnomes.

��76ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He had lost track of how many security enchantments had been placed upon the Burrow by both 
the Order and the Ministry; all he knew was that it was no longer possible for anybody to travel by 
magic directly into the place. Mr. Weasley had therefore gone to meet the Delacours on top of a 
nearby hill, where they were to arrive by Portkey. The first sound of their approach was an 
unusually high-pitched laugh, which turned out to be coming from Mr. Weasley, who appeared at 
the gate moments later, laden with luggage and leading a beautiful blonde woman in long, leaf 
green robes, who could be Fleur��s mother. 

��Mama!�� cried Fleur, rushing forward to embrace her. ��Papa!�� 

Monsieur Delacour was nowhere near as attractive as his wife; he was a head shorter and 
extremely plump, with a little, pointed black beard. However, he looked good-natured. Bouncing 
towards Mrs. Weasley on high-heeled boots, he kissed her twice on each cheek, leaving her 
flustered. 

��You 'ave been so much trouble,�� he said in a deep voice. ��Fleur tells us you 'ave been working 

very 'ard.�� 

��Oh, it��s been nothing, nothing!�� trilled Mrs. Weasley. ��No trouble at all!�� 

Ron relieved his feelings by aiming a kick at a gnome who was peering out from behind one of 

the new Flutterby bushes. 

��Dear lady!�� said Monsieur Delacour, still holding Mrs. Weasley��s hand between his own two 
plump ones and beaming. ��We are most honored at the approaching union of our two families! Let 
me present my wife, Apolline.�� 

Madame Delacour glided forward and stooped to kiss Mrs. Weasley too. 

��Enchant��e,�� she said. ��Your 'usband 'as been telling us such amusing stories!�� 

Mr. Weasley gave a maniacal laugh; Mrs. Weasley threw him a look, upon which he became 
immediately silent and assumed an expression appropriate to the sickbed of a close friend. 

��And, of course, you 'ave met my leetle daughter, Gabrielle!�� said Monsieur Delacour. Gabrielle 
was Fleur in miniature; eleven years old, with waist-length hair of pure, silvery blonde, she gave 
Mrs. Weasley a dazzling smile and hugged her, then threw Harry a glowing look, batting her 
eyelashes. Ginny cleared her throat loudly. 

��Well, come in, do!�� said Mrs. Weasley brightly, and she ushered the Delacours into the house, 
with many "No, please!"s and "After you! "s and "Not at all!"s. 

��77ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The Delacours, it soon transpired, were helpful, pleasant guests. They were pleased with 
everything and keen to assist with the preparations for the wedding. Monsieur Delacour 
pronounced everything from the seating plan to the bridesmaids�� shoes ��Charmant!�� Madame 
Delacour was most accomplished at household spells and had the oven properly cleaned in a trice 
(quickly, immediately); Gabrielle followed her elder sister around, trying to assist in any way she 
could and jabbering away in rapid French. 

On the downside, the Burrow was not built to accommodate so many people. Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley were now sleeping in the sitting room, having shouted down Monsieur and Madame 
Delacour��s protests and insisted they take their bedroom. Gabrielle was sleeping with Fleur in 
Percy��s old room, and Bill would be sharing with Charlie, his best man, once Charlie arrived from 
Romania. Opportunities to make plans together became virtually nonexistent, and it was in 
desperation that Harry, Ron and Hermione took to volunteering to feed the chickens just to escape 
the overcrowded house. 

��But she still won��t leave us alone!�� snarled Ron, and their second attempt at a meeting in the 
yard was foiled (frustrate) by the appearance of Mrs. Weasley carrying a large basket of laundry in 
her arms. 

��Oh, good, you��ve fed the chickens,�� she called as she approached them. ��We��d better shut them 
away again before the men arrive tomorrow ... to put up the tent for the wedding,�� she explained, 
pausing to lean against the henhouse. She looked exhausted. ��Millamant��s Magic Marquees����
Ļ;���� ... they��re very good. Bill��s escorting them... You��d better stay inside while they��re here, 
Harry. I must say it does complicate organizing a wedding, having all these security spells around 
the place.�� 

��I��m sorry,�� said Harry humbly. 

��Oh, don��t be silly, dear!�� said Mrs. Weasley at once. ��I didn��t mean �C well, your safety��s much 
more important! Actually, I��ve been wanting to ask you how you want to celebrate your birthday, 
Harry. Seventeen, after all, it��s an important day... " 

��I don��t want a fuss,�� said Harry quickly, envisaging the additional strain this would put on 
them all. ��Really, Mrs. Weasley, just a normal dinner would be fine... It��s the day before the 
wedding... �� 

��Oh, well, if you��re sure, dear. I��ll invite Remus and Tonks, shall I? And how about Hagrid?��

��That��d be great,�� said Harry. ��But please, don��t go to loads of trouble.�� 

��Not at all, not at all ... It��s no trouble... �� 

She looked at him, a long, searching look, then smiled a little sadly, straightened up, and walked 
away. Harry watched as she waved her wand near the washing line, and the damp clothes rose into 
the air to hang themselves up, and suddenly he felt a great wave of remorse for the inconvenience 
and the pain he was giving her.

Chapter Seven 
The Will of Albus Dumbledore 


He was walking along a mountain road in the 


cool blue light 
of dawn. Far below, swathed (wrap, envelop) in 

mist, was the 
shadow of a small town. Was the man he sought 

down there, the 
man he needed so badly he could think of little 

else, the man 
who held the answer, the answer to his problem... 

? 
"Oi, wake up." 
Harry opened his eyes. He was lying again on 


the camp bed in 
Ron's dingy attic room. The sun had not yet risen and the room was still shadowy. Pigwidgeon was 
asleep with his head under his tiny wing. The scar on Harry's forehead was prickling. 

"You were muttering in your sleep." 

"Was I?" 

"Yeah. 'Gregorovitch.' You kept saying 'Gregorovitch.'" 

Harry was not wearing his glasses; Ron's face appeared slightly blurred. 

"Who's Gregorovitch?" 

"I dunno, do I? You were the one saying it." 

Harry rubbed his forehead, thinking. He had a vague idea he had heard the name before, but he 
could not think where. 

"I think Voldemort's looking for him." 

"Poor bloke," said Ron fervently. 

Harry sat up, still rubbing his scar, now wide awake. He tried to remember exactly what he had 

seen in the dream, but all that came back was a mountainous horizon and the outline of the little 

village cradled in a deep valley. 

"I think he's abroad." 

"Who, Gregorovitch?" 

"Voldemort. I think he's somewhere abroad, looking for Gregorovitch. It didn't look like 
anywhere in Britain." 

"You reckon you were seeing into his mind again?" Ron sounded worried.

��80ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Do me a favor and don't tell Hermione," said Harry. "Although how she expects me to stop 

seeing stuff in my sleep...�� 

He gazed up at little Pigwidgeon's cage, thinking... Why was the name "Gregorovitch" familiar? 

"I think," he said slowly, "he's got something to do with Quidditch. There's some connection, 

but I can't... I can't think what it is." 

"Quidditch?" said Ron. "Sure you're not thinking of Gorgovitch?" 

"Who?" 

"Dragomir Gorgovitch, Chaser, transferred to the Chudley Cannons for a record fee two years 

ago. Record holder for most Quaffle drops in a season." 

"No," said Harry. "I'm definitely not thinking of Gorgovitch." 

"I try not to either," said Ron. "Well, happy birthday anyway." 

"Wow, that's right, I forgot! I'm seventeen!" 

Harry seized the wand lying beside his camp bed, pointed it at the cluttered desk where he had 
left his glasses, and said, "Accio Glasses!" Although they were only around a foot away, there was 
something immensely satisfying about seeing them zoom toward him, at least until they poked him 
in the eye. 

"Slick," snorted Ron. 

Reveling in the removal of his Trace, Harry sent Ron's possessions flying around the room, 
causing Pigwidgeon to wake up and flutter excitedly around his cage. Harry also tried tying the 
laces of his trainers by magic (the resultant knot took several minutes to untie by hand) and, purely 
for the pleasure of it, turned the orange robes on Ron's Chudley Cannons posters bright blue. 

"I'd do your fly by hand, though," Ron advised Harry, sniggering when Harry immediately 
checked it. "Here's your present. Unwrap it up here, it's not for my mother's eyes." 

"A book?" said Harry as he took the rectangular parcel. "Bit of a departure from tradition, isn't 
it?" 

"This isn't your average book," said Ron. "It'd pure gold, Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm 
Witches. Explains everything you need to know about girls. If only I'd had this last year I'd have 
known exactly how to get rid of Lavender and I would've known how to get going with... Well, 
Fred and George gave me a copy, and I've learned a lot. You'd be surprised, it's not all about 
wandwork, either."

When they arrived in the kitchen they found a pile of presents waiting on the table. Bill and 
Monsieur Delacour were finishing their breakfasts, while Mrs. Weasley stood chatting to them 
over the frying pan. 

"Arthur told me to wish you a happy seventeenth, Harry," said Mrs. Weasley, beaming at him. 
"He had to leave early for work, but he'll be back for dinner. That's our present on top." 

Harry sat down, took the square parcel she had indicated, and unwrapped it. Inside was a watch 
very like the one Mr. and Mrs. Weasley had given Ron for his seventeenth; it was gold, with stars 
circling around the face instead of hands. 

"It's traditional to give a wizard a watch when he comes of age," said Mrs. Weasley, watching 
him anxiously from beside the cooker. "I'm afraid that one isn't new like Ron's, it was actually my 
brother Fabian's and he wasn't terribly careful with his possessions, it's a bit dented on the back, 
but-" 

The rest of her speech was lost; Harry had got up and hugged her. He tried to put a lot of unsaid 
things into the hug and perhaps she understood them, because she patted his cheek clumsily when 
he released her, then waved her wand in a slightly random way, causing half a pack of bacon to 
flop out of the frying pan onto the floor. 

"Happy birthday, Harry!" said Hermione, hurrying into the kitchen and adding her own present 
to the top of the pile. "It's not much, but I hope you like it. What did you get him?" she added to 
Ron, who seemed not to hear her. 

"Come on, then, open Hermione's!" said Ron. 

She had bought him a new Sneakoscope. The other packages contained an enchanted razor from 
Bill and Fleur ("Ah yes, zis will give you ze smoothest shave you will ever 'ave," Monsieur 
Delacour assured him, "but you must tell it clearly what you want... ozzerwise you might find you 
'ave a leetle less hair zan you would like...��), chocolates from the Delacours, and an enormous box 
of the latest Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes merchandise from Fred and George. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not linger at the table, as the arrival of Madame Delacour, Fleur, 
and Gabrielle made the kitchen uncomfortably crowded. 

"I'll pack these for you," Hermione said brightly, taking Harry's presents out of his arms as the 
three of them headed back upstairs. "I'm nearly done, I'm just waiting for the rest of your 
underpants to come out of the wash, Ron -" 

��82ҳ��

Ron's splutter was interrupted by the opening of a door on the first-floor landing. 

"Harry, will you come in here a moment?" 

It was Ginny. Ron came to an abrupt halt, but Hermione took him by the elbow and tugged him 
on up the stairs. Feeling nervous, Harry followed Ginny into her room. 

He had never been inside it before. It was small, but bright. There was a large poster of the 
Wizarding band the Weird Sisters on one wall, and a picture of Gwenog Jones, Captain of the all-
witch Quidditch team the Holyhead Harpies, on the other. A desk stood facing the open window, 
which looked out over the orchard where he and Ginny had once played a two-a-side Quidditch 
with Ron and Hermione, and which now housed a large, pearly white marquee. The golden flag on 
top was level with Ginny's window. 

Ginny looked up into Harry's face, took a deep breath, and said, "Happy seventeenth." 

"Yeah... thanks." 

She was looking at him steadily; he however, found it difficult to look back at her; it was like 
gazing into a brilliant light. 

"Nice view," he said feebly, pointing toward with window. 

She ignored this. He could not blame her. 

"I couldn't think what to get you," she said. 

"You didn't have to get me anything." 

She disregarded this too. "I didn't know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you 

wouldn't be able to take it with you." 

He chanced a glance at her. She was not tearful; that was one of the many wonderful things 
about Ginny, she was rarely weepy. He had sometimes thought that having six brothers must have 
toughened her up. 

She took a step closer to him. 

"So then I thought, I'd like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet 
some veela when you're off doing whatever you're doing." 

"I think dating opportunities are going to be pretty thin on the ground, to be honest." 

"There's the silver lining (ʧ�������е� )һ��ϣ�� /ο�壩 I've been looking for," she 
whispered, and then she was kissing him as she had never kissed him before, and Harry was 
kissing her back, and it was blissful oblivion better than firewhisky; she was the only real thing in

��83ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the world, Ginny, the feel of her, one hand at her back and one in her long, sweet-smelling hair-

The door banged open behind them and they jumped apart. 

"Oh," said Ron pointedly. "Sorry." 

"Ron!" Hermione was just behind him, slight out of breath. There was a strained silence, then 

Ginny had said in a flat little voice, "Well, happy birthday anyway, Harry." 

Ron's ears were scarlet; Hermione looked nervous. Harry wanted to slam the door in their faces, 
but it felt as though a cold draft had entered the room when the door opened, and his shining 
moment had popped like a soap bubble. All the reasons for ending his relationship with Ginny, for 
staying well away from her, seemed to have slunk inside the room with Ron, and all happy 
forgetfulness was gone. 

He looked at Ginny, wanting to say something, though he hardly knew what, but she had turned 
her back on him. He thought that she might have succumbed, for once, to tears. He could not do 
anything to comfort her in front of Ron. 

"I'll see you later," he said, and followed the other two out of the bedroom. 

Ron marched downstairs, through the still-crowded kitchen and into the yard, and Harry kept 
pace with him all the way, Hermione trotting along behind them looking scared. 

Once he reached the seclusion of the freshly mown lawn, Ron rounded on Harry. 

"You ditched her. What are you doing now, messing her around?" 

"I'm not messing her around," said Harry, as Hermione caught up with them. 

"Ron-" 

But Ron held up a hand to silence her. 

"She was really cut up when you ended it -" 

"So was I. You know why I stopped it, and it wasn't because I wanted to." 

"Yeah, but you go snogging her now and she's just going to get her hopes up again-" 

"She's not an idiot, she knows it can't happen, she's not expecting us to... to end up married, or -" 

As he said it, a vivid picture formed in Harry's mind of Ginny in a white dress, marrying a tall, 
faceless, and unpleasant stranger. 

In one spiraling moment it seemed to hit him, her future was free and unencumbered, whereas 
his... he could see nothing but Voldemort ahead. 

"If you keep groping her every chance you get -" 

��84ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"It won't happen again," said Harry harshly. The day was cloudless, but he felt as though the sun 
had gone in. "Okay?" 

Ron looked half resentful, half sheepish; he rocked backward and forward on his feet for a 
moment, then said, "Right then, well, that's... yeah." 

Ginny did not seek another one-to-one meeting with Harry for the rest of the day, nor by any 
look or gesture did she show that they had shared more than polite conversation in her room. 
Nevertheless, Charlie's arrival came as a relief to Harry. It provided a distraction, watching Mrs. 
Weasley force Charlie into a chair, raise her wand threateningly, and announce that he was about 
to get a proper haircut. 

As Harry's birthday dinner would have stretched the Burrow's kitchen to breaking point even 
before the arrival of Charlie, Lupin, Tonks, and Hagrid, several tables were placed end to end in 
the garden. Fred and George bewitched a number of purple lanterns all emblazoned with a large 
number 17, to hang in midair over the guests. Thanks to Mrs. Weasley's ministrations, George's 
wound was neat and clean, but Harry was not yet used to the dark hole in the side of his head, 
despite the twins' many jokes about it. 

Hermione made purple and gold streamers erupt from the end of her wand and drape themselves 
artistically over the trees and bushes. 

"Nice," said Ron, as with one final flourish of her wand, Hermione turned the leaves on the 
crabapple tree to gold. "You've really got an eye for that sort of thing." 

"Thank you, Ron!" said Hermione, looking both pleased and a little confused. Harry turned 
away, smiling to himself. He had a funny notion that he would find a chapter on compliments 
when he found time to peruse his copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches; he caught 
Ginny's eye and grinned at her before remembering his promise to Ron and hurriedly striking up a 
conversation with Monsieur Delacour. 

"Out of the way, out of the way!" sang Mrs. Weasley, coming through the gate with what 
appeared to be a giant, beach-ball-sized Snitch floating in front of her. Seconds later Harry realized 
that it was his birthday cake, which Mrs. Weasley was suspending with her wand, rather than risk 
carrying it over the uneven ground. 

When the cake had finally landed in the middle of the table, Harry said, "That looks amazing, 
Mrs. Weasley."

"Oh, it's nothing, dear," she said fondly. Over her shoulder, Ron gave Harry the thumbs-up and 
mouthed, Good one. 

By seven o'clock all the guests had arrived, led into the house by Fred and George, who had 
waited for them at the end of the lane. Hagrid had honored the occasion by wearing his best, and 
horrible, hairy brown suit. Although Lupin smiled as he shook Harry's hand, Harry thought he 
looked rather unhappy. It was all very odd; Tonks, beside him, looked simply radiant. 

"Happy birthday, Harry," she said, hugging him tightly. 

"Seventeen, eh!" said Hagrid as he accepted a bucket-sized glass of wine from Fred. "Six years 
ter the day since we met, Harry, d'yeh remember it?" 

"Vaguely," said Harry, grinning up at him. "Didn't you smash down the front door, give Dudley 
a pig's tail, and tell me I was a wizard?" 

"I forge' the details," Hagrid chortled. "All righ', Ron, Hermione?" 

"We're fine," said Hermione. "How are you?" 

"Ar, not bad. Bin busy, we got some newborn unicorns. I'll show yeh when yeh get back -" 
Harry avoided Ron's and Hermione's gazes as Hagrid rummaged in his pocket. "Here. Harry, 
couldn't think what ter get yeh, but then I remembered this." He pulled out a small, slightly furry 
drawstring pouch with a long string, evidently intended to be worn around the neck. "Mokeskin. 
Hide anythin' in there an' no one but the owner can get it out. They're rare, them." 

"Hagrid, thanks!" 

"'S'nothin'," said Hagrid with a wave of a dustbin-lid-sized hand. "An' there's Charlie! Always 
liked him. Hey! Charlie!" 

Charlie approached, running his hand slightly ruefully over his new, brutally short haircut. He 
was shorter than Ron, thickset, with a number of burns and scratches up his muscled arms. 

"Hi, Hagrid, how's it going?" 

"Bin meanin' ter write fer ages. How's Norbert doin'?" 

"Norbert?" Charlie laughed. "The Norwegian Ridgeback? We call her Norberta now." 

"Wha, Norbert's a girl?" 

"Oh yeah," said Charlie. 

"How can you tell?" asked Hermione. 

"They're a lot more vicious," said Charlie. He looked over his shoulder and dropped his voice.

"Wish Dad would hurry up and get here. Mum's getting edgy." 

They all looked over at Mrs. Weasley. She was trying to talk to Madame Delacour while 
glancing repeatedly at the gate. 

"I think we'd better start without Arthur," she called to the garden at large after a moment or 
two. "He must have been held up at... oh!" 

They all saw it at the same time, a streak of light that came flying across the yard and onto the 
table, where it resolved itself into a bright silver weasel, which stood on its hind legs and spoke 
with Mr. Weasley's voice. 

"Minister of Magic coming with me." 

The Patronus dissolved into thin air, leaving Fleur's family peering in astonishment at the place 
where it had vanished. 

"We shouldn't be here," said Lupin at once. "Harry, I'm sorry, I'll explain some other time." 

He seized Tonks��s wrist and pulled her away; they reached the fence, climbed over it, and 

vanished from sight. Mrs. Weasley looked bewildered. 

"The Minister, but why? I don't understand -" 

But there was no time to discuss the matter; a second later, Mr. Weasley had appeared out of 
thin air at the gate, accompanied by Rufus Scrimgeour, instantly recognizable by his mane of 
grizzled hair. 

The two newcomers marched across the yard toward the garden and the lantern-lit table, where 
everybody sat in silence, watching them draw closer. As Scrimgeour came within range of the 
lantern light. Harry saw that he looked much older than the last time they had met, scraggy������ 
and grim. 

"Sorry to intrude," said Scrimgeour, as he limped to a halt before the table. "Especially as I can 

see that I am gate-crashing a party." 

His eyes lingered for a moment on the giant Snitch cake. "Many happy returns." 

"Thanks," said Harry. 

"I require a private word with you," Scrimgeour went on. "Also with Mr. Ronald Weasley and 

Miss Hermione Granger." 

"Us?" said Ron, sounding surprised. "Why us?" 

"I shall tell you that when we are somewhere more private," said Scrimgeour. "Is there such a

��87ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

place?" he demanded of Mr. Weasley. 

"Yes, of course," said Mr. Weasley, who looked nervous. "The, er, sitting room, why don't you 
use that?" 

"You can lead the way," Scrimgeour said to Ron. "There will be no need for you to accompany 
us, Arthur." 

Harry saw Mr. Weasley exchange a worried look with Mrs. Weasley as he, Ron, and Hermione 
stood up. As they led the way back to the house in silence, Harry knew that the other two were 
thinking the same as he was: Scrimgeour must, somehow, have learned that the three of them were 
planning to drop out of Hogwarts. 

Scrimgeour did not speak as they all passed through the messed kitchen and into the Burrow's 
sitting room. Although the garden had been full of soft golden evening light, it was already dark in 
here; Harry flicked his wand at the oil lamps as he entered and they illuminated the shabby but 
cozy room. Scrimgeour sat himself in the sagging armchair that Mr. Weasley normally occupied, 
leaving Harry, Ron, and Hermione to squeeze side by side onto the sofa. 

Once they had done so, Scrimgeour spoke. "I have some questions for the three of you, and I 
think it will be best if we do it individually. If you two" -he pointed at Harry and Hermione -"can 
wait upstairs, I will start with Ronald." 

"We're not going anywhere," said Harry, while Hermione nodded vigorously. "You can speak to 
us together, or not at all." 

Scrimgeour gave Harry a cold, appraising look. Harry had the impression that the Minister was 
wondering whether it was worthwhile opening hostilities this early. 

"Very well then, together," he said, shrugging. He cleared his throat. "I am here, as I'm sure you 
know, because of Albus Dumbledore's will." 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. 

"A surprise, apparently! You were not aware then that Dumbledore had left you anything?" 

"A-all of us?" said Ron, "Me and Hermione too?" 

"Yes, all of -" 

But Harry interrupted. "Dumbledore died over a month ago. Why has it taken this long to give 
us what he left us?" 

"Isn't it obvious?" said Hermione, before Scrimgeour could answer. "They wanted to examine

��88ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

whatever he's left us. You had no right to do that!" she said, and her voice trembled slightly. 

"I had every right," said Scrimgeour dismissively. "The Decree for Justifiable Confiscation 
gives the Ministry the power the confiscate the contents of a will -" 

"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts," said Hermione, "and the 
Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions are illegal before 
seizing them! Are you telling me that you thought Dumbledore was trying to pass us something 
cursed?" 

"Are you planning to follow a career in Magical Law, Miss Granger?" asked Scrimgeour. 

"No, I'm not," retorted Hermione. "I'm hoping to do some good in the world!" 

Ron laughed. Scrimgeour's eyes flickered toward him and away again as Harry spoke. 

"So why have you decided to let us have our things now? Can't think of a pretext to keep them?" 

"No, it'll be because thirty-one days are up," said Hermione at once. "They can't keep the objects 
longer than that unless they can prove they're dangerous. Right?" 

"Would you say you were close to Dumbledore, Ronald?" asked Scrimgeour, ignoring 

Hermione. 

Ron looked startled. "Me? Not, not really... It was always Harry who...�� 

Ron looked around at Harry and Hermione, to see Hermione giving him a stop-talking-now! sort 
of look, but the damage was done. 

Scrimgeour looked as though he had heard exactly what he had expected, and wanted, to hear. 
He swooped like a bird of prey upon Ron's answer. 

"If you were not very close to Dumbledore, how do you account for the fact that he remembered 
you in his will? He made exceptionally few personal bequests. The vast majority of his possessions 
-his private library, his magical instruments, and other personal effects 
(personal property, private 
belongings) - were left to Hogwarts. Why do you think you were singled out?" 

"I... dunno," said Ron. "I... when I say we weren't close... I mean, I think he liked me..." 

"You're being modest, Ron," said Hermione. "Dumbledore was very fond of you." 

This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had 
never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been negligible. 

However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew 
out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a

��89ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud. 

"'The Last Will and Testament of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore'... Yes, here we 
are... 'To Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my Deluminator, in the hope that he will remember me 
when he uses it.'" 

Scrimgeour took from the bag an object that Harry had seen before, it looked something like a 
silver cigarette lighter, but it had, he knew, the power to suck all light from a place, and restore it, 
with a simple click. Scrimgeour leaned forward and passed the Deluminator to Ron, who took it 
and turned it over in the fingers looking stunned. 

"That is a valuable object," said Scrimgeour, watching Ron. "It may even be unique. Certainly it 

is of Dumbledore's own design. Why would he have left you an item so rare?" 

Ron shook his head, looking bewildered. 

"Dumbledore must have taught thousands of students," Scrimgeour persevered. "Yet the only 

ones he remembered in his will are you three. Why is that? To what use did he think you would put 

to the Deluminator, Mr. Weasley?" 

"Put out lights, I s'pose," mumbled Ron. "What else could I do with it?" 

Evidently Scrimgeour had no suggestions. After squinting at Ron for a moment or two, he 
turned back to Dumbledore's will. 

"'To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard, in the hope 
that she will find it entertaining and instructive.'" 

Scrimgeour now pulled out of the bag a small book that looked as ancient as the copy of Secrets 
of the Darkest Art upstairs. Its bindingװ�� was stained and peeling in places. Hermione took it 
from Scrimgeour without a word. She held the book in her lap and gazed at it. Harry saw that the 
title was in runes; he had never learned to read them. As he looked, a tear splashed onto the 
embossed symbols. 

"Why do you think Dumbledore left you that book, Miss Granger?" asked Scrimgeour. 

"He... he knew I liked books," said Hermione in a thick voice, mopping her eyes with her sleeve. 

"But why that particular book?" 

"I don't know. He must have thought I'd enjoy it." 

"Did you ever discuss codes, or any means of passing secret messages, with Dumbledore?" 

"No, I didn't," said Hermione, still wiping her eyes on her sleeve. "And if the Ministry hasn't

��90ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

found any hidden codes in this book in thirty-one days, I doubt that I will." 

She suppressed a sob. They were wedged together so tightly that Ron had difficulty extracting 
his arm to put it around Hermione's shoulders. Scrimgeour turned back to the will. 

"'To Harry James Potter,'" he read, and Harry's insides contracted with a sudden excitement, "'I 
leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards 
of perseverance and skill.'" 

As Scrimgeour pulled out the tiny, walnut-sized golden ball, its silver wings fluttered rather 

feebly, and Harry could not help feeling a definite sense of anticlimax����ɨ�˵Ľ�β. 

"Why did Dumbledore leave you this Snitch?" asked Scrimgeour. 

"No idea," said Harry. "For the reasons you just read out, I suppose... to remind me what you 

can get if you... persevere and whatever it was." 

"You think this a mere symbolic keepsake, then?" 

"I suppose so," said Harry. "What else could it be?" 

"I'm asking the questions," said Scrimgeour, shifting his chair a little closer to the sofa. Dusk 
was really falling outside now; the marquee beyond the windows towered ghostly white over the 
hedge. 

"I notice that your birthday cake is in the shape of a Snitch," Scrimgeour said to Harry. "Why is 
that?" 

Hermione laughed derisively. "Oh, it can't be a reference to the fact Harry's a great Seeker, that's 
way too obvious," she said. "There must be a secret message from Dumbledore hidden in the 
icing!" 

"I don't think there's anything hidden in the icing," said Scrimgeour, "but a Snitch would be a 

very good hiding place for a small object. You know why, I'm sure?" 

Harry shrugged. 

Hermione, however, answered. 

Harry thought that answering questions correctly was such a deeply ingrained habit she could 

not suppress the urge. 

"Because Snitches have flesh memories," she said. 

"What?" said Harry and Ron together; both considered Hermione's Quidditch knowledge 

negligible.

"Correct," said Scrimgeour. "A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released, not even 
by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human 
to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch" -he held up the tiny golden ball "
will remember your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical 
skill whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you." 

Harry's heart was beating rather fast. He was sure that Scrimgeour was right. How could he 
avoid taking the Snitch with his bare hand in front of the Minister? 

"You don't say anything," said Scrimgeour. "Perhaps you already know what the Snitch 
contains?" 

"No," said Harry, still wondering how he could appear to touch the Snitch without really doing 
so. If only he knew Legilimency, really knew it, and could read Hermione's mind; he could 
practically hear her brain whizzing beside him. 

"Take it," said Scrimgeour quietly. 

Harry met the Minister's yellow eyes and knew he had no option but to obey. He held out his 
hand, and Scrimgeour leaned forward again and place the Snitch, slowly and deliberately, into 
Harry's palm. 

Nothing happened. As Harry's fingers closed around the Snitch, its tired wings fluttered and 
were still. Scrimgeour, Ron, and Hermione continued to gaze avidly at the now partially concealed 
ball, as if still hoping it might transform in some way. 

"That was dramatic," said Harry coolly. Both Ron and Hermione laughed. 

"That's all, then, is it?" asked Hermione, making to raise herself off the sofa. 

"Not quite," said Scrimgeour, who looked bad tempered now. "Dumbledore left you a second 
bequest, Potter." 

"What is it?" asked Harry, excitement rekindling. 

Scrimgeour did not bother to read from the will this time. 

"The sword of Godric Gryffindor," he said. 

Hermione and Ron both stiffened. Harry looked around for a sign of the ruby-encrusted hilt, but 
Scrimgeour did not pull the sword from the leather pouch, which in any case looked much too 
small to contain it. 

"So where is it?" Harry asked suspiciously.

��92ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Unfortunately," said Scrimgeour, "that sword was not Dumbledore's to give away. The sword 
of Godric Gryffindor is an important historical artifact, and as such, belongs -" 

"It belongs to Harry!" said Hermione hotly. "It chose him, he was the one who found it, it came 
to him out of the Sorting Hat -" 

"According to reliable historical sources, the sword may present itself to any worthy 
Gryffindor," said Scrimgeour. "That does not make it the exclusive property of Mr. Potter, 
whatever Dumbledore may have decided." Scrimgeour scratched his badly shaven cheek, 
scrutinizing Harry. "Why do you think -?" 

"-Dumbledore wanted to give me the sword?" said Harry, struggling to keep his temper. "Maybe 
he thought it would look nice on my wall." 

"This is not a joke, Potter!" growled Scrimgeour. "Was it because Dumbledore believed that 
only the sword of Godric Gryffindor could defeat the Heir of Slytherin? Did he wish to give you 
that sword, Potter, because he believed, as do many, that you are the one destined to destroy HeWho-
Must-Not-Be-Named?" 

"Interesting theory," said Harry. "Has anyone ever tried sticking a sword in Voldemort? Maybe 
the Ministry should put some people onto that, instead of wasting their time stripping down 
Deluminators or covering up breakouts from Azkaban. So this is what you've been doing, Minister, 
shut up in your office, trying to break open a Snitch? People are dying �C I was nearly one of them 

�C Voldemort chased me across three counties, he killed Mad-Eye Moody, but there's no word 
about any of that from the Ministry, has there? And you still expect us to cooperate with you!" 
"You go too far!" shouted Scrimgeour, standing up, Harry jumped to his feet too. Scrimgeour 
limped toward Harry and jabbed him hard in the chest with the point of his wand; it singed a hole 
in Harry's T-shirt like a lit cigarette. 

"Oi!" said Ron, jumping up and raising his own wand, but Harry said, "No! D'you want to give 
him an excuse to arrest us?" 

"Remembered you're not at school, have you?" said Scrimgeour breathing hard into Harry's 
face. "Remembered that I am not Dumbledore, who forgave your insolence and insubordination? 
You may wear that scar like a crown, Potter, but it is not up to a seventeen-year-old boy to tell me 
how to do my job! It's time you learned some respect!" 

"It's time you earned it." said Harry.

The floor trembled; there was a sound of running footsteps, then the door to the sitting room 
burst open and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley ran in. 

"We... we thought we heard -" began Mr. Weasley, looking thoroughly alarmed at the sight of 
Harry and the Minister virtually nose to nose. 

"- raised voices," panted Mrs. Weasley. 

Scrimgeour took a couple of steps back from Harry, glancing at the hole he had made in Harry's 
T-shirt. He seemed to regret his loss of temper. 

"It �C it was nothing," he growled. "I ... regret your attitude," he said, looking Harry full in the 
face once more. "You seem to think that the Ministry does not desire what you �C what Dumbledore 

�C desired. We ought to work together." 
"I don't like your methods, Minister," said Harry. "Remember?" 
For the second time, he raised his right fist and displayed to Scrimgeour the scar that still 
showed white on the back of it, spelling I must not tell lies . Scrimgeour's expression hardened. He 
turned away without another word and limped from the room. Mrs. Weasley hurried after him; 
Harry heard her stop at the back door. After a minute or so she called, "He's gone!" 

"What did he want?" Mr. Weasley asked, looking around at Harry, Ron, and Hermione as Mrs. 
Weasley came hurrying back to them. 

"To give us what Dumbledore left us," said Harry. "They've only just released the content of his 
will." 

Outside in the garden, over the dinner tables, the three objects Scrimgeour had given them were 
passed from hand to hand. Everyone exclaimed over the Deluminator and The Tales of Beedle the 
Bard and lamented the fact that Scrimgeour had refused to pass on the sword, but none of them 
could offer any suggestion as to why Dumbledore would have left Harry an old Snitch. As Mr. 
Weasley examined the Deluminator for the third or fourth time, Mrs. Weasley said tentatively, 
"Harry, dear, everyone's awfully hungry we didn't like to start without you... Shall I serve dinner 
now?" 

They all ate rather hurriedly and then after a hasty chorus of "Happy Birthday" and much 
gulping of cake, the party broke up. Hagrid, who was invited to the wedding the following day, but 
was far too bulky to sleep in the overstretched Burrow, left to set up a tent for himself in a 
neighboring field.

542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Meet us upstairs," Harry whispered to Hermione, while they helped Mrs. Weasley restore the 
garden to its normal state. "After everyone's gone to bed." 

Up in the attic room, Ron examined his Deluminator, and Harry filled Hagrid's mokeskin purse, 
not with gold, but with those items he most prized, apparently worthless though some of them 
were, the Marauder's Map, the shard of Sirius's enchanted mirror, and R.A.B.'s locket. He pulled 
the string tight and slipped the purse around his neck, then sat holding the old Snitch and watching 
its wings flutter feebly. At last, Hermione tapped on the door and tiptoed inside. 

"Muffiato," she whispered, waving her wand in the direction of the stairs. 

"Thought you didn't approve of that spell?" said Ron. 

"Times change," said Hermione. "Now, show us that Deluminator." 

Ron obliged at once. Holding it up in front of him, he clicked it. The solitary lamp they had lit 
went out at once. 

"The thing is," whispered Hermione through the dark, "we could have achieved that with 
Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder." 

There was a small click, and the ball of light from the lamp flew back to the ceiling and 
illuminated them all once more. 

"Still, it's cool," said Ron, a little defensively. "And from what they said, Dumbledore invented 
it himself!" 

"I know, but, surely he wouldn't have singled you out in his will just to help us turn out the 
lights!" 

"D'you think he knew the Ministry would confiscate his will and examine everything he'd left 
us?" asked Harry. 

"Definitely," said Hermione. "He couldn't tell us in the will why he was leaving us these things, 
but that will doesn't explain -�� 

"- why he couldn't have given us a hint when he was alive?" asked Ron. 

"Well, exactly," said Hermione, now flicking through The Tales of Beedle the Bard. "If these 
things are important enough to pass on right under the nose of the Ministry, you'd think he'd have 
left us know why... unless he thought it was obvious?" 

"Thought wrong, then, didn't he?" said Ron. "I always said he was mental. Brilliant and 
everything, but cracked. Leaving Harry an old Snitch �C what the hell was that about?" 

��95ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I've no idea," said Hermione. "When Scrimgeour made you take it, Harry, I was so sure that 
something was going to happen!" 

"Yeah, well," said Harry, his pulse quickened as he raised the Snitch in his fingers. "I wasn't 
going to try too hard in front of Scrimgeour, was I?" 

"What do you mean?" asked Hermione. 

"The Snitch I caught in my first ever Quidditch match?" said Harry. "Don't you remember?" 

Hermione looked simply bemused. Ron, however, gasped, pointing frantically from Harry to the 

Snitch and back again until he found his voice. "That was the one you nearly swallowed!" 

"Exactly," said Harry, and with his heart beating fast, he pressed his mouth to the Snitch. 

It did not open. Frustration and bitter disappointment welled up inside him, He lowered the 

golden sphere, but then Hermione cried out. 

"Writing! There's writing on it, quick, look!" He nearly dropped the Snitch in surprise and 
excitement. Hermione was quite right. Engraved upon the smooth golden surface, where seconds 
before there had been nothing, were five words written in the thin, slanted handwriting that Harry 
recognized as Dumbledore's: 

I open at the close. 

He had barely read them when the words vanished again. 

"'I open at the close...' What's that supposed to mean?" 

Hermione and Ron shook their heads, looking blank. 

"I open at the close... at the close... I open at the close...�� 

But no matter how often they repeated the words, with many different inflections, they were 
unable to wring any more meaning from them. 

"And the sword," said Ron finally, when they had at last abandoned their attempts to divineռ

��;�Ʋ� meaning in the Snitch's inscription. 

"Why did he want Harry to have the sword?" 

"And why couldn't he just have told me?" Harry said quietly. "I was there, it was right there on 
the wall of his office during all our talks last year! If he wanted me to have it, why didn't he just 
give it to me then?" 

He felt as thought he were sitting in an examination with a question he ought to have been able 
to answer in front of him, his brain slow and unresponsive. Was there something he had missed in

��96ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the long talks with Dumbledore last year? Ought he to know what it all meant? Had Dumbledore 
expected him to understand? 

"And as for this book." Said Hermione, "The Tales of Beedle the Bard ... I've never even heard 
of them!" 

"You've never heard of The Tales of Beedle the Bard?" said Ron incredulously. "You're kidding, 
right?" 

"No, I'm not," said Hermione in surprise. "Do you know them then?" 

"Well, of course I do!" 

Harry looked up, diverted. The circumstance of Ron having read a book that Hermione had not 

was unprecedented. Ron, however, looked bemused by their surprise. 

"Oh come on! All the old kids' stories are supposed to be Beedle's aren't they? 'The Fountain of 
Fair Fortune' ... 'The Wizard and the Hopping Pot'... 'Babbitty Rabbitty and her Cackling 
Stump'..." 

"Excuse me?" said Hermione giggling. "What was the last one?" 

"Come off it!" said Ron, looking in disbelief from Harry to Hermione. "You must've heard of 
Babbitty Rabbitty �C" 

"Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!" said Hermione. "We didn't 
hear stories like that when we were little, we heard 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarves' and 
'Cinderella' �C" 

"What's that, an illness?" asked Ron. 

"So these are children's stories?" asked Hermione, bending against over the runes. 

"Yeah." Said Ron uncertainly. "I mean, just what you hear, you know, that all these old stories 
came from Beedle. I dunno what they're like in the original versions." 

"But I wonder why Dumbledore thought I should read them?" 

Something cracked downstairs. 

"Probably just Charlie, now Mum's asleep, sneaking off to regrow his hair," said Ron nervously. 

"All the same, we should get to bed," whispered Hermione. "It wouldn't do to oversleep 
tomorrow." 

"No," agreed Ron. "A brutal triple murder by the bridegroom's mother might put a bit of damper 
on the wedding. I'll get the light."

Chapter Eight 

The Wedding 

Three o��clock on the following afternoon found 


Harry, 
Ron, Fred and George standing outside the great white 

marquee 
in the orchard, awaiting the arrival of the wedding 

guests. 
Harry had taken a large dose of Polyjuice Potion and 

was now 
the double of a redheaded Muggle boy from the local 

village, 
Ottery St. Catchpole, from whom Fred had stolen hairs using a 

Summoning Charm. The plan was to introduce Harry as ��Cousin Barny�� and trust to the great 
number of Weasley relatives to camouflage him. 

All four of them were clutching seating plans, so that they could help show people to the right 
seats. A host of white-robed waiters had arrived an hour earlier, along with a golden jacketed band, 
and all of these wizards were currently sitting a short distance away under a tree. Harry could see a 
blue haze of pipe smoke issuing from the spot. Behind Harry, the entrance to the marquee revealed 
rows and rows of fragile golden chairs set on either side of a long purple carpet. The supporting 
poles were entwined with white and gold flowers. Fred and George had fastened an enormous 
bunch of golden balloons over the exact point where Bill and Fleur would shortly become husband 
and wife. Outside, butterflies and bees were hovering lazily over the grass and hedgerow. Harry 
was rather uncomfortable. The Muggle boy whose appearance he was affecting��װ was slightly 
fatter than him and his dress robes felt hot and tight in the full glare of a summer��s day. 

��When I get married,�� said Fred, tugging at the collar of his own robes, ��I won��t be bothering 
with any of this nonsense. You can all wear what you like, and I��ll put a full Body Bind Curse on 
Mum until it��s all over.�� 

��She wasn��t too bad this morning, considering,�� said George. ��Cried a bit about Percy not 
being here, but who wants him. Oh blimey, brace yourselves, here they come, look.�� 

Brightly colored figures were appearing, one by one out of nowhere at the distant boundary of 
the yard. Within minutes a procession had formed, which began to snake its way up through the 
garden toward the marquee. Exotic flowers and bewitched birds fluttered on the witches�� hats, 
while precious gems glittered from many of the wizards�� cravats; a hum of excited chatter grew

��99ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

louder and louder, drowning the sound of the bees as the crowd approached the tent. 

��Excellent, I think I see a few veela cousins,�� said George, craning his neck for a better look. 
��They��ll need help understanding our English customs, I��ll look after them.�� 

��Not so fast, Your Holeyness,�� said Fred, and darting past the gaggle of middle-aged witches 
heading for the procession, he said, ��Here �C permetiez moi to assister vous,�� to a pair of pretty 
French girls, who giggled and allowed him to escort them inside. George was left to deal with the 
middle-aged witches and Ron took charge of Mr. Weasley��s old Ministry-colleague Perkins, while 
a rather deaf old couple fell to Harry��s lot. 

��Wotcher,�� said a familiar voice as he came out of the marquee again and found Tonks and 
Lupin at the front of the queue. She had turned blonde for the occasion. ��Arthur told us you were 
the one with the curly hair. Sorry about last night,�� she added in a whisper as Harry led them up 
the aisle. ��The Ministry��s being very anti-werewolf at the moment and we thought our presence 
might not do you any favors.�� 

��It��s fine, I understand,�� said Harry, speaking more to Lupin than Tonks. Lupin gave him a 
swift smile, but as they turned away Harry saw Lupin��s face fall again into lines of misery. He did 
not understand it, but there was no time to dwell on the matter. Hagrid was causing a certain 
amount of disruption. Having misunderstood Fred��s directions as he had sat himself, not upon the 
magically enlarged and reinforced seat set aside for him in the back row, but on five sets that now 
resembled a large pile of golden matchsticks. 

While Mr. Weasley repaired the damage and Hagrid shouted apologies to anybody who would 
listen, Harry hurried back to the entrance to find Ron face-to-face with a most eccentric-looking 
wizard. Slightly cross-eyedб�ӵ�;�����۵�, with shoulder-length white hair the texture of candy 
floss (British) cotton candy, he wore a cap whose tassel dangled in front of his nose and robes of 
an eye-watering shade of egg-yolk yellow. An odd symbol, rather like a triangular eye, glistened 
from a golden chain around his neck. 

��Xenophilius Lovegood,�� he said, extending a hand to Harry, ��my daughter and I live just over 
the hill, so kind of the good Weasleys to invite us. But I think you know my Luna?�� he added to 
Ron. 

 ��Yes,�� said Ron. ��Isn��t she with you?�� 

��She lingered in that charming little garden to say hello to the gnomes, such a glorious

��100ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

infestation! How few wizards realize just how much we can learn from the wise little gnomes �C or, 
to give them their correct name, the Gernumbli gardensi.�� 

��Ours do know a lot of excellent swear words,�� said Ron, ��but I think Fred and George taught 
them those.��

 He led a party of warlocks into the marquee as Luna rushed up. 

 ��Hello, Harry!�� she said. 

 ��Er �C my name��s Barry,�� said Harry, flummoxed. (Slang) confuse

 ��Oh, have you changed that too?�� she asked brightly.

 ��How did you know -?��

 ��Oh, just your expression,�� she said. 

Like her father, Luna was wearing bright yellow robes, which she had accessorized with a large 
sunflower in her hair. Once you get over the brightness of it all, the general effect was quite 
pleasant. At least there were no radishes dangling from her ears. 

Xenophilius, who was deep in conversation with an acquaintance, had missed the exchange 
between Luna and Harry. Biding the wizard farewell, he turned to his daughter, who held up her 
finger and said, ��Daddy, look �C one of the gnomes actually bit me.�� 

��How wonderful! Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial.�� Said Mr. Lovegood, seizing Luna��s 
outstretched fingers and examining the bleeding puncture marks. ��Luna, my love, if you should 
feel any burgeoning��ѿ talent today �C perhaps an unexpected urge to sing opera or to declaims 
in Mermish �C do not repress it! You may have been gifted by the Gernumblies!��

 Ron, passing them in the opposite direction let out a loud snort. 

��Ron can laugh,�� said Luna serenely as Harry led her and Xenophilius toward their seats, ��but 
my father has done a lot of research on Gernumbli magic.�� 

��Really?�� said Harry, who had long since decided not to challenge Luna or her father��s peculiar 
views. ��Are you sure you don��t want to put anything on that bite, though?�� 

��Oh, it��s fine,�� said Luna, sucking her finger in a dreamy fashion and looking Harry up and 
down. ��You look smart. I told Daddy most people would probably wear dress robes, but he 
believes you ought to wear sun colors to a wedding, for luck, you know.�� 

As she drifted off after her father, Ron reappeared with an elderly witch clutching his arm. Her 
beaky nose, red-rimmed eyes, and leathery pink hat gave her the look of a bad-tempered flamingo

��101ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

���. 

��... and your hair��s much too long, Ronald, for a moment I thought you were Ginevra. Merlin��s 
beard, what is Xenophilius Lovegood wearing? He looks like an omelet. And who are you?�� she 
barked at Harry.

 ��Oh yeah, Auntie Muriel, this is our cousin Barny.�� 

��Another Weasley? You breed like gnomes. Isn��t Harry Potter here? I was hoping to meet him. 
I thought he was a friend of yours, Ronald, or have you merely been boasting?��

 ��No �C he couldn��t come �C�� 

��Hmm. Made an excuse, did he? Not as gormless as he looks in press photographs, then. I��ve 
just been instructing the bride on how best to wear my tiara,�� she shouted at Harry. ��Goblin-made, 
you know, and been in my family for centuries. She��s a good-looking girl, but still �C French. Well, 
well, find me a good seat, Ronald, I am a hundred and seven and I ought not to be on my feet too 
long.�� 

Ron gave Harry a meaningful look as he passed and did not reappear for some time. When next 
they met at the entrance, Harry had shown a dozen more people to their places. The Marquee was 
nearly full now and for the first time there was no queue outside. 

��Nightmare, Muriel is,�� said Ron, mopping his forehead on his sleeve. ��She used to come for 
Christmas every year, then, thank God, she took offense because Fred and George set off a 
Dungbomb under her chair at diner. Dad always says she��ll have written them out of her will �C like 
they care, they��re going to end up richer than anyone in the family, rate they��re going... Wow,�� he 
added, blinking rather rapidly as Hermione came hurrying toward them. ��You look great!�� 

��Always the tone of surprise,�� said Hermione, though she smiled. She was wearing a floaty, 
lilac�϶��� ,����ɫ -colored dress with matching high heels; her hair was sleek and shiny. ��Your 
Great-Aunt Muriel doesn��t agree, I just met her upstairs while she was giving Fleur the tiara. She 
said, 'Oh dear, is this the Muggle-born?' and then, 'Bad posture and skinny ankles.'��

 ��Don��t take it personally, she��s rude to everyone,�� said Ron. 

��Talking about Muriel?�� inquired George, reemerging from the marquee with Fred. ��Yeah, 
she��s just told me my ears are lopsided. Old bat. I wish old Uncle Bilius was still with us, though; 
he was a right laugh at weddings.��

 ��Wasn��t he the one who saw a Grim and died twenty-four hours later?�� asked Hermione.

��102ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Well, yeah, he went a bit odd toward the end,�� conceded George. 

��But before he went loopy (crazy) he was the life and soul of the party,�� said Fred. ��He used to 
down an entire bottle of firewhisky, then run onto the dance floor, hoist up his robes, and start 
pulling bunches of flowers out of his �C��

 ��Yes, he sounds a real charmer,�� said Hermione, while Harry roared with laughter.

 ��Never married, for some reason,�� said Ron. 

 ��You amaze me,�� said Hermione. 

They were all laughing so much that none of them noticed the latecomer, a dark-haired young 
man with a large, curved nose and thick black eyebrows, until he held out his invitation to Ron and 
said, with his eyes on Hermione, ��You look vunderful.�� 

��Viktor!�� she shrieked, and dropped her small beaded bag, which made a loud thump quite 
disproportionate to its size. As she scrambled, blushing, to pick it up, she said ��I didn��t know you 
were �C goodness �C it��s lovely to see �C how are you?�� 

Ron��s ears had turned bright red again. After glancing at Krum��s invitation as if he did not 

believe a word of it, he said, much too loudly, ��how come you��re here?��

 ��Fleur invited me,�� said Krum, eyebrows raised. 

Harry, who had no grudge against Krum, shook hands; then feeling that it would be prudent to 
remove Krum from Ron��s vicinity, offered to show him his seat. 

��Your friend is not pleased to see me,�� said Krum, as they entered the now packed marquee. 
��Or is he a relative?�� he added with a glance at Harry��s red curly hair.

 ��Cousin.�� Harry muttered, but Krum was not really listening. His appearance was causing a stir, 
particularly amongst the veela cousins, He was, after all, a famous Quidditch player. While people 
were still craning their necks to get a good look at him, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and George came 
hurrying down the aisle.

 ��Time to sit down,�� Fred told Harry, ��or we��re going to get run over by the bride.�� 

Harry, Ron and Hermione took their seats in the second row behind Fred and George. 
Hermione looked rather pink and Ron��s ears were still scarlet. After a few moments he muttered to 
Harry, ��Did you see he��s grown a stupid little beard?��

 Harry gave a noncommittal grunt. 

A sense of jittery anticipation had filled the warm tent, the general murmuring broken by

��103ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

occasional spurts of excited laughter. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley strolled up the aisle, smiling and 
waving at relatives; Mrs. Weasley was wearing a brand-new set of amethyst��ˮ�� , colored robes 
with a matching hat. 

A moment later Bill and Charlie stood up at the front of the marquee, both wearing dress robes, 
with larger white roses in their buttonholes; Fred wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of 
giggling from the veela cousins. Then the crowd fell silent as music swelled from what seemed to 
be the golden balloons. 

 ��Ooooh!�� said Hermione, swiveling around in her seat to look at the entrance. 

A great collective sigh issued from the assembled witches and wizards as Monsieur Delacour 
and Fleur came walking up the aisle, Fleur gliding, Monsieur Delacour bouncing and beaming. 
Fleur was wearing a very simple white dress and seemed to be emitting a strong, silvery glow. 
While her radiance usually dimmed everyone else by comparison, today it beautified everybody it 
fell upon. Ginny and Gabrielle, both wearing golden dresses, looked even prettier than usual and 
once Fleur had reached for him, Bill did not look as though he had ever met Fenrit Greyback. 

��Ladies and gentlemen,�� said a slightly singsong voice, and with a slight shock, Harry saw the 
same small, tufty-hired wizard who had presided at Dumbledore��s funeral, now standing in front of 
Bill and Fleur. ��We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of two faithful souls...�� 

��Yes, my tiara set off the whole thing nicely,�� said Auntie Muriel in a rather carrying whisper. 
��But I must say, Ginevra��s dress is far too low cut.�� 

Ginny glanced around, grinning, winked at Harry, then quickly faced the front again. Harry��s 
mind wandered a long way from the marquee, back to the afternoons spent alone with Ginny in 
lonely parts of the school grounds. They seemed so long ago; they had always seemed too good to 
be true, as though he had been stealing shining hours from a normal person��s life, a person without 
a lightning-shaped scar on his forehead... . 

 ��Do you, William Arthur, take Fleur Isabelle ...?�� 

In the front row, Mrs. Weasley and Madame Delacour were both sobbing quietly into scraps of 
lace. Trumpet-like sounds from the back of the marquee told everyone that Hagrid had taken out 
one of his own tablecloth-sized handkerchiefs. Hermione turned around and beamed at Harry; her 
eyes too were full of tears. 

 ��... then I declare you bonded for life.��

��104ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The tufty-haired wizard waved his hand high over the heads of Bill and Fleur and a shower of 
silver stars fell upon them, spiraling around their now entwined figures. As Fred and George led a 
round of applause, the golden balloons overhead burst. Birds of paradise and tiny golden bells flew 
and floated out of them, adding their songs and chimes to the din. 

 ��Ladies and gentlemen!�� called the tufty-haired wizard. ��If you would please stand up!�� 

They all did so, Auntie Muriel grumbling audibly; he waved his wand again. The seats on 
which they had been sitting rose gracefully into the air as the canvas walls of the marquee 
vanished, so that they stood beneath a canopy supported by golden poles, with a glorious view of 
the sunlit orchard and surrounding countryside. Next, a pool of molten gold spread from the center 
of the tent to form a gleaming dance floor; the hovering chairs grouped themselves around small, 
white-clothed tables, which all floated gracefully back to earth round it, and the golden-jacketed 
band trooped toward a podium. 

��Smooth,�� said Ron approvingly as the waiters popped up on all sides, some bearing silver 
trays of pumpkin juice, butterbeer, and firewhisky, others tottering piles of tarts and sandwiches. 

��We should go and congratulate them!�� said Hermione, standing on tiptoe to see the place 
where Bill and Fleur had vanished amid a crowd of well-wishers. 

��We��ll have time later,�� shrugged Ron, snatching three butterbeers from a passing tray and 
handing one to Harry. ��Hermione, cop hold (take hold of, look at), let��s grab a table... Not there! 
Nowhere near Muriel �C��

 Ron led the way across the empty dance floor, glancing left and right as he went; Harry felt sure 
that he was keeping an eye out for Krum. By the time they had reached the other side of the 
marquee, most of the tables were occupied, The emptiest was the one where Luna sat alone.

 ��All right if we join you?�� asked Ron. 

 ��Oh yes,�� she said happily. ��Daddy��s just gone to give Bill and Fleur our present.��

 ��What is it, a lifetime��s supply of Gurdyroots?�� asked Ron. 

Hermione aimed a kick at him under the table, but caught Harry instead. Eyes watering in pain, 
Harry lost track of the conversation for a few moments. 

The band had begun to play, Bill and Fleur took to the dance floor first, to great applause; after 
a while, Mr. Weasley led Madame Delacour onto the floor, followed by Mrs. Weasley and Fleur��s 
father.

��I like this song,�� said Luna, swaying in time to the waltzlike tune, and a few seconds later she 
stood up and glided onto the dance floor, where she revolved on the spot, quite alone, eyes closed 
and waving her arms.

 ��She��s great, isn��t she?�� said Ron admiringly. ��Always good value.��

 But the smile vanished from his face at once, Viktor Krum had dropped into Luna��s vacant seat. 
Hermione looked pleasurably flustered but this time Krum had not come to compliment her. With 
a scowl on his face he said, ��Who is that man in the yellow?�� 

��That��s Xenophilius Lovegood, he��s the father of a friend of ours,�� said Ron. His pugnacious 
tone indicated that they were not about to laugh at Xenophilius, despite the clear provocation. 
��Come and dance,�� he added abruptly to Hermione. 

She looked taken aback, but pleased too, and got up. They vanished together into the growing 

throng on the dance floor. 

 ��Ah, they are together now?�� asked Krum, momentarily distracted.

 ��Er �C sort of,�� said Harry.

 ��Who are you?�� Krum asked. 

 ��Barny Weasley.��

 They shook hands. 

 ��You, Barny �C you know this man Lovegood well?��

 ��No, I only met him today. Why?�� 

Krum glowered over the top of his drink, watching Xenophilius, who was chatting to several 
warlocks on the other side of the dance floor. 

��Because,�� said Krum, ��If he vus not a guest of Fleur��s I vould duel him, here and now, for 
veering that filthy sign upon his chest.�� 

��Sign?�� said Harry, looking over at Xenophilius too. The strange triangular eye was gleaming 
on his chest. ��Why? What��s wrong with it?��

 ��Grindelvald. That is Grindelvald��s sign.��

 ��Grindelwald... the Dark wizard Dumbledore defeated?��

 ��Exactly.�� 

Krum��s jaw muscles worked as if he were chewing, then he said, ��Grindelvald killed many 

people, my grandfather, for instance. Of course, he vos never powerful in this country, they said he

feared Dumbledore �C and rightly, seeing how he vos finished. But this�� �C he pointed a finger at 
Xenophilius �C ��this is his symbol, I recognized it at vunce, Grindelvald carved it into a vall at 
Durmstrang ver he vos a pupil there. Some idiots copied it onto their books and clothes thinking to 
shock, make themselves impressive �C until those of us who had lost family members to 
Grindelvald taught them better.�� 

Krum cracked his knuckles menacingly and glowered at Xenophilius. Harry felt perplexed. It 
seemed incredibly unlikely that Luna��s father was a supporter of the Dark Arts, and nobody else in 
the tent seemed to have recognized the triangular, fin-like shape. 

 ��Are you �C er �C quite sure it��s Grindelwald��s -?�� 

��I am not mistaken,�� said Krum coldly. ��I walked past that sign for several years, I know it 
vell.�� 

��Well, there��s a chance,�� said Harry, ��that Xenophilius doesn��t actually know what the symbol 
means, the Lovegoods are quite... unusual. He could have easily picked it up somewhere and think 
it��s a cross section����� of the head of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack or something.��

 ��The cross section of a vot?��

 ��Well, I don��t know what they are, but apparently he and his daughter go on holiday looking for 
them.��

 Harry felt he was doing a bad job explaining Luna and her father. 

��That��s her,�� he said, pointing at Luna, who was still dancing alone, waving her arms around 

her head like someone attempting to beat off midges��. 

 ��Vy is she doing that?�� asked Krum.

 ��Probably trying to get rid of a Wrackspurt,�� said Harry, who recognized the symptoms. 

Krum did not seem to know whether or not Harry was making fun of him. He drew his wand 

from inside his robe and tapped it menacingly on his thighs; sparks flew out of the end. 

��Gregorovitch!�� said Harry loudly, and Krum started, but Harry was too excited to care; the 
memory had come back to him at the sight of Krum��s wand, Ollivander taking it and examining it 
carefully before the Triwizard Tournament.

 ��Vot about him?�� asked Krum suspiciously.

 ��He��s a wandmaker!��

 ��I know that,�� said Krum.

��107ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He made your wand! That��s why I thought �C Quidditch �C��

 Krum was looking more and more suspicious.

 ��How do you know Gregorovitch made my wand?�� 

��I... I read it somewhere, I think,�� said Harry. ��In a �C a fan magazine,�� he improvised wildly 
and Krum looked mollified.

 ��I had not realized I ever discussed my vand with fans,�� he said.

 ��So... er... where is Gregorowitch these days?�� 

Krum looked puzzled. ��He retired several years ago. I was one of the last to purchase a 
Gregorovitch vand. They are the best �Calthough I know, of course, that your Britons set much store 
by Ollivander.�� 

Harry did not answer. He pretended to watch the dancers, like Krum, but he was thinking hard. 
So Voldemort was looking for a celebrated wandmaker and Harry did not have to search far for a 
reason. It was surely because of what Harry�� wand had done on the night that Voldemort pursued 
him across the skies. The holly and phoenix feather wand had conquered the borrowed wand, some 
thing that Ollivander had not anticipated or understood. Would Gregorowitch know better? Was he 
truly more skilled than Ollivander, did he know secrets of wands that Ollivander did not? 

��This girl is very nice-looking,�� Krum said, recalling Harry to his surroundings. Krum was 
pointing at Ginny, who had just joined Luna. ��She is also a relative of yours?�� 

��Yeah,�� said Harry, suddenly irritated, ��and she��s seeing someone. Jealous type. Big bloke. 
You wouldn��t want to cross him.�� 

Krum grunted. 

��Vot,�� he said, draining his goblet and getting to his feet again, ��is the point of being an 
international Quidditch player if all the good-looking girls are taken?�� 

And he strode off leaving Harry to take a sandwich from a passing waiter and make his way 
around the edge of the crowded dance floor. He wanted to find Ron, to tell him about 
Gregorovitch, but he was dancing with Hermione out in the middle of the floor. Harry leaned up 
against one of the golden pillars and watched Ginny, who was now dancing with Fred and 
George��s friend Lee Jordan, trying not to feel resentful about the promise he had given Ron. 

He had never been to a wedding before, so he could not judge how Wizarding celebrations 
differed from Muggle ones, though he was pretty sure that the latter would not involve a wedding

cake topped with two model phoenixes that took flight when the cake was cut, or bottles of 
champagne that floated unsupported through the crowd. As the evening drew in, and moths began 
to swoop under the canopy, now lit with floating golden lanterns, the revelry became more and 
more uncontained. Fred and George had long since disappeared into the darkness with a pair of 
Fleur��s cousins; Charlie, Hagrid, and a squat wizard in a purple porkpie hat were singing ��Odo the 
Hero�� in the corner. 

Wandering through the crowd so as to escape a drunken uncle of Ron��s who seemed unsure 
whether or not Harry was his son, Harry spotted an old wizard sitting alone at a table. His cloud of 

white hair made him look rather like an aged dandelion clock 


and was topped by a moth-

eaten fez������ձñ . He was vaguely familiar. Racking his brains, Harry suddenly realized that 
this was Elphias Doge, member of the Order of the Phoenix and the writer of Dumbledore��s 
obituary.

 Harry approached him.

 ��May I sit down?��

 ��Of course, of course,�� said Doge; he had a rather high-pitched, wheezy voice.

 Harry leaned in. ��Mr. Doge, I��m Harry Potter.�� 

Doge gasped. ��My dear boy! Arthur told me you were here, disguised. I am so glad, so 
honored!��

 In a flutter of nervous pleasure Doge poured Harry a goblet of champagne. ��I thought of writing 
to you,�� he whispered, ��after Dumbledore... the shock... and for you, I am sure...�� Doge��s tiny eyes 
filled with sudden tears. 

��I saw the obituary you wrote for the Daily Prophet,�� said Harry. ��I didn��t realize you knew 
Professor Dumbledore so well.��

 ��As well as anyone,�� said Doge, dabbing his eyes with a napkin. ��Certainly I knew him longest, 
if you don��t count Aberforth �C and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.��

 ��Speaking of the Daily Prophet... I don��t know whether you saw, Mr. Doge -?��

 ��Oh, please call me Elphias, dear boy.��

 ��Elphias, I don��t know whether you saw the interview Rita Skeeter gave about Dumbledore?�� 

Doge��s face flooded with angry color. ��Oh yes, Harry, I saw it. That woman, or vulture might

be a more accurate term, positively pestered me to talk to her, I am ashamed to say that I became 
rather rude, called her an interfering trout, which resulted, as you my have seen, in aspersions cast 
upon my sanity.�� 

��Well, in that interview,�� Harry went on, ��Rita Skeeter hinted that Professor Dumbledore was 
involved in the Dark Arts when he was young.�� 

��Don��t believe a word of it!�� said Doge at once. ��Not a word, Harry! Let nothing tarnish your 
memories of Albus Dumbledore!�� 

Harry looked into Doge��s earnest, pained face, and felt, not reassured, but frustrated. Did Doge 
really think it was that easy, that Harry could simply choose not to believe? Didn��t Doge 
understand Harry��s need to be sure, to know everything?�� 

Perhaps Doge suspected Harry��s feelings, for he looked concerned and hurried on, ��Harry, Rita 

Skeeter is a dreadful �C��

 But he was interrupted by a shrill cackle.

 ��Rita Skeeter? Oh, I love her, always read her!�� 

Harry and Doge looked up to see Auntie Muriel standing there, the plumes dancing on her hair, 

a goblet of champagne in her hand. ��She��s written a book about Dumbledore, you know!�� 

��Hello, Muriel,�� said Doge, ��Yes, we were just discussing �C��

 ��You there! Give me your chair, I��m a hundred and seven!�� 

Another redheaded Weasley cousin jumped off his seat, looking alarmed, and Auntie Muriel 
swung it around with surprising strength and plopped herself down upon it between Doge and 
Harry. 

��Hello again, Barry or whatever your name is,�� she said to Harry, ��Now what were you saying 
about Rita Skeeter, Elphias? You know, she��s written a biography of Dumbledore? I can��t wait to 
read it. I must remember to place an order at Flourish and Blotts!�� 

Doge looked stiff and solemn at this, but Auntie Muriel drained her goblet and clicked her bony 
fingers at a passing waiter for a replacement. 

She took another large gulp of champagne, belched and then said, ��There��s no need to look like 
a pair of stuffed frogs! Before he became so respected and respectable and all that tosh (nonesense, 
rubbish), there were some mighty funny rumors about Albus!��

 ��Ill-informed sniping�̰�����,�� said Doge, turning radish-colored again.

��110ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��You would say that, Elphias,�� cackled Auntie Muriel. ��I noticed how you skated over�ӹ� ;��
�� the sticky patches in that obituary of yours!�� 

��I��m sorry you think so,�� said Doge, more coldly still. ��I assure you I was writing from the 
heart.�� 

��Oh, we all know you worshipped Dumbledore; I daresay you��ll still think he was a saint even 
if it does turn out that he did away with his Squib sister!��

 ��Muriel!�� exclaimed Doge. 

 A chill that had nothing to do with the iced champagne was stealing through Harry��s chest. 

��What do you mean?�� he asked Muriel. ��Who said his sister was a Squib? I thought she was 

ill?�� 

��Thought wrong, then, didn��t you, Barry!�� said Auntie Muriel, looking delighted at the effect 
she had produced. ��Anyway, how could you expect to know anything about it? It all happened 
years and years before you were even thought of, my dear, and the truth is that those of us who 
were alive then never knew what really happened. That��s why I can��t wait to find out what 
Skeeter��s unearthed! Dumbledore kept that sister of his quiet for a long time!��

 ��Untrue!�� wheezed Doge, ��Absolutely untrue!��

 ��He never told me his sister was a Squib,�� said Harry, without thinking, still cold inside. 

��And why on earth would he tell you?�� screeched Muriel, swaying a little in her seat as she 
attempted to focus upon Harry. 

��The reason Albus never spoke about Ariana,�� began Elphias in a voice stiff with emotion, ��is, 
I should have thought, quite clear. He was so devastated by her death �C�� 

��Why did nobody ever see her, Elphias?�� squawked Muriel, ��Why did half of us never even 
know she existed, until they carried the coffin out of the house and held a funeral for her? Where 
was saintly Albus while Ariana was locked in the cellar? Off being brilliant at Hogwarts, and never 
mind what was going on in his own house!��

 ��What d��you mean, locked in the cellar?�� asked Harry. ��What is this?��

 Doge looked wretched. Auntie Muriel cackled again and answered Harry. 

��Dumbledore��s mother was a terrifying woman, simply terrifying. Muggle-born, though I heard 
she pretended otherwise.�� 

��She never pretended anything of the sort! Kendra was a fine woman,�� whispered Doge

miserably, but Auntie Muriel ignored him. 

��-proud and very domineering, the sort of witch who would have been mortified to produce a 
Squib-��

 ��Ariana was not a Squib!�� wheezed Doge. 

��So you say, Elphias, but explain, then, why she never attended Hogwarts!�� said Auntie Muriel. 
She turned back to Harry. ��In our day, Squibs were often hushed up, though to take it to the 
extreme of actually imprisoning a little girl in the house and pretending she didn��t exist �C�� 

��I tell you, that��s not what happened!�� said Doge, but Auntie Muriel steamrollered on, still 
addressing Harry. 

��Squibs were usually shipped off to Muggle schools and encouraged to integrate into the 
Muggle community... much kinder than trying to find them a place in the Wizarding world, where 
they must always be second class, but naturally Kendra Dumbledore wouldn��t have dreamed of 
letting her daughter go to a Muggle school �C��

 ��Ariana was delicate!�� said Doge desperately. ��Her health was always too poor to permit her �C�� 

��-to permit her to leave the house?�� cackled Muriel. ��And yet she was never taken to St. 
Mungo��s and no Healer was ever summoned to see her!��

 ��Really, Muriel, how can you possibly know whether ...�� 

��For your information, Elphias, my cousin Lancelot was a Healer at St. Mungo��s at the time, 

and he told my family in strictest confidence that Ariana had never been seen there. All most 

suspicious, Lancelot thought!�� 

Doge looked to be on the verge of tears. 

Auntie Muriel, who seemed to be enjoying herself hugely, snapped her fingers for more 
champagne. Numbly Harry thought of how the Dursleys had once shut him up, locked him away, 
kept him out of sight, all for the crime of being a wizard. Had Dumbledore��s sister suffered the 
same fate in reverse, imprisoned for her lack of magic? And had Dumbledore truly left her to her 
fate while he went off to Hogwarts to prove himself brilliant and talented? 

��Now, if Kendra hadn��t died first,�� Muriel resumed, ��I��d have said that it was she who finished 
off Ariana �C�� 

��How can you, Muriel!�� groaned Doge. ��A mother kill her own daughter? Think what you��re 
saying!��

��112ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��If the mother in question was capable of imprisoning her daughter for years on end, why not?�� 
shrugged Auntie Muriel. ��But as I say, it doesn��t fit, because Kendra died before Ariana �C of what, 
nobody ever seemed sure. 

��Yes, Ariana might have made a desperate bid for freedom and killed Kendra in the struggle,�� 
said Auntie Muriel thoughtfully. ��Shake your head all you like, Elphias. You were at Ariana��s 
funeral, were you not?�� 

��Yes I was,�� said Doge, through trembling lips, ��and a more desperately sad occasion I cannot 
remember. Albus was heartbroken-�� 

��His heart wasn��t the only thing. Didn��t Aberforth break Albus�� nose halfway through the 
service?�� 

If Doge had looked horrified before this, it was nothing to how he looked now. Muriel might 
have stabbed him. She cackled loudly and took another swig of champagne, which dribbled down 
her chin. 

 ��How do you -?�� croaked Doge. 

��My mother was friendly with old Bathilda Bagshot,�� said Auntie Muriel happily. ��Bathilda 
described the whole thing to mother while I was listening at the door. A coffin-side brawl. The 
way Bathilda told it, Aberforth shouted that it was all Albus�� fault that Ariana was dead and then 
punched him in the face. According to Bathilda, Albus did not even defend himself, and that��s odd 
enough in itself. Albus could have destroyed Aberforth in a duel with both hands tied behind his 
back. 

Muriel swigged yet more champagne. The recitation of those old scandals seemed to elate her 
as much as they horrified Doge. Harry did not know what to think, what to believe. He wanted the 
truth and yet all Doge did was sit there and bleat feebly that Ariana had been ill. Harry could 
hardly believe that Dumbledore would not have intervened if such cruelty was happening inside 
his own house, and yet there was undoubtedly something odd about the story. 

��And I��ll tell you something else,�� Muriel said, hiccupping slightly as she lowered her goblet. 
��I think Bathilda has spilled the beans to Rita Skeeter. All those hints in Skeeter��s interview about 
an important source close to the Dumbledores �C goodness knows she was there all through the 
Ariana business, and it would fit!��

 ��Bathilda would never talk to Rita Skeeter!�� whispered Doge. 

��113ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Bathilda Bagshot?�� Harry said. ��The author of A History of Magic?�� 

The name was printed on the front of one of Harry��s textbooks, though admittedly not one of 
the ones he had read more attentively. 

��Yes,�� said Doge, clutching at Harry��s question like a drowning man at a life heir. ��A most 
gifted magical historian and an old friend of Albus��s.��

 ��Quite gaga these days, I��ve heard,�� said Auntie Muriel cheerfully. 

��If that is so, it is even more dishonorable for Skeeter to have taken advantage of her,�� said 

Doge, ��and no reliance can be placed on anything Bathilda may have said!�� 

��Oh, there are ways of bringing back memories, and I��m sure Rita Skeeter knows them all,�� 
said Auntie Muriel ��But even if Bathilda��s completely cuckoo, I��m sure she��d still have old 
photographs, maybe even letters. She knew the Dumbledores for years. Well worth a trip to 
Godric��s Hollow, I��d have thought.�� 

Harry, who had been taking a sip of butterbeer, choked. Doge banged him on the back as Harry 
coughed, looking at Auntie Muriel through streaming eyes. Once he had control of his voice again, 
he asked, ��Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric��s Hollow?�� 

��Oh yes, she��s been there forever! The Dumbledores moved there after Percival was 

imprisoned, and she was their neighbor.��

 ��The Dumbledores lived in Godric��s Hollows?��

 ��Yes, Barry, that��s what I just said,�� said Auntie Muriel testily. 

Harry felt drained, empty. Never once, in six years, had Dumbledore told Harry that they had 
both lived and lost loved ones in Godric��s Hollow. Why? Were Lily and James buried close to 
Dumbledore��s mother and sister? Had Dumbledore visited their graves, perhaps walked past Lily��s 
and James��s to do so? And he had never once told Harry ... never bothered to say... 

And why it was so important, Harry could not explain even to himself, yet he felt it had been 
tantamount to a lie not to tell him that they had this place and these experiences in common. He 
stared ahead of him, barely noticing what was going on around him, and did not realize that 
Hermione had appeared out of the crowd until she drew up a chair beside him. 

��I simply can��t dance anymore,�� she panted, slipping of one of her shoes and rubbing the sole 
of her foot. ��Ron��s gone looking to find more butterbeers. It��s a bit odd. I��ve just seen Viktor 
storming away from Luna��s father, it looked like they��d been arguing �C�� She dropped her voice,

staring at him. ��Harry, are you okay?�� 

Harry did not know where to begin, but it did not matter, at that moment, something large and 
silver came falling through the canopy over the dance floor. Graceful and gleaming, the lynxɽè
��� landed lightly in the middle of the astonished dancers. Heads turned, as those nearest it froze 
absurdly in mid-dance. Then the Patronus��s mouth opened wide and it spoke in the loud, deep, 
slow voice of Kingsley Shacklebolt.

 ��The Ministry has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They are coming.��

Chapter Nine 

A Place to Hide 

Everything seemed fuzzy, slow. Harry and 


Hermione jumped 
to their feet and drew their wands. Many people 

were only just 
realizing that something strange had happened; 

heads were still 
turning toward the silver cat as it vanished. 

Silence spread 
outward in cold ripples from the place where the 

Patronus had 
landed. Then somebody screamed. 
Harry and Hermione threw themselves into the panicking crowd. Guests were sprinting in all 

directions; many were Disapparating; the protective enchantments around the Burrow had broken. 

 ��Ron!�� Hermione cried. ��Ron, where are you?�� 

As they pushed their way across the dance floor, Harry saw cloaked and masked figures 
appearing in the crowd; then he saw Lupin and Tonks, their wands raised, and heard both of them 
shout, ��Protego!��, a cry that was echoed on all sides �C 

��Ron! Ron!�� Hermione called, half sobbing as she and Harry were buffeted by terrified guests, 
Harry seized her hand to make sure they weren��t separated as a streak of light whizzed over their 
heads, whether a protective charm or something more sinister he did not know �C 

And then Ron was there. He caught hold of Hermione��s free arm, and Harry felt her turn on the 
spot; sight and sound were extinguished as darkness pressed in upon him; all he could feel was 
Hermione��s hand as he was squeezed through space and time, away from the Burrow, away from 
the descending Death Eaters, away, perhaps, from Voldemort himself... 

 ��Where are we?�� said Ron��s voice. 

Harry opened his eyes. For a moment he thought they had not left the wedding after all; they 
still seemed to be surrounded by people. 

��Tottenham Court Road,�� panted Hermione. ��Walk, just walk, we need to find somewhere for 
you to change.�� 

Harry did as she asked. They half walked, half ran up the wide dark street thronged with late-
night revelers and lined with closed shops, stars twinkling above them. A double-decker bus 
rumbled by and a group of merry pub-goers ogled them as they passed; Harry and Ron were still

��116ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

wearing dress robes. 

��Hermione, we haven��t got anything to change into,�� Ron told her, as a young woman burst 
into raucous giggles at the sight of him.

 ��Why didn��t I make sure I had the Invisibility Cloak with me?�� said Harry, inwardly cursing his 
own stupidity. ��All last year I kept it on me and �C��

 ��It��s okay, I��ve got the Cloak, I��ve got clothes for both of you,�� said Hermione, ��Just try and act 
naturally until �C this will do.��

 She led them down a side street, then into the shelter of a shadowy alleyway. 

��When you say you��ve got the Cloak, and clothes ...�� said Harry, frowning at Hermione, who 
was carrying nothing except her small beaded handbag, in which she was now rummaging. 

��Yes, they��re here,�� said Hermione, and to Harry and Ron��s utter astonishment, she pulled out a 
pair of jeans, a sweatshirt, some maroon socks, and finally the silvery Invisibility Cloak.

 ��How the ruddy hell �C?�� 

��Undetectable Extension Charm,�� said Hermione. ��Tricky, but I think I��ve done it okay; 
anyway, I managed to fit everything we need in here.�� She gave the fragile-looking bag a little 
shake and it echoed like a cargo hold as a number of heavy objects rolled around inside it. ��Oh, 
damn, that��ll be the books,�� she said, peering into it, ��and I had them all stacked by subject. Oh 
well... Harry, you��d better take the Invisibility Cloak. Ron, hurry up and change.��

 ��When did you do all this?�� Harry asked as Ron stripped off his robes. 

��I told you at the Burrow, I��ve had the essentials packed for days, you know, in case we needed 
to make a quick getaway. I packed your rucksack this morning, Harry, after you changed, and put 
it in here... I just had a feeling... ��

 ��You��re amazing, you are,�� said Ron, handing her his bundled-up robes. 

��Thank you,�� said Hermione, managing a small smile as she pushed the robes into the bag. 
��Please, Harry, get that Cloak on!�� 

Harry threw his Invisibility Cloak around his shoulders and pulled it up over his head, 
vanishing from sight. He was only just beginning to appreciate what had happened.

 ��The others �C everybody at the wedding �C��

 ��We can��t worry about that now,�� whispered Hermione. ��It��s you they��re after, Harry, and we��ll 

just put everyone in even more danger by going back.��

��117ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��She��s right,�� said Ron, who seemed to know that Harry was about to argue, even if he could 
not see his face. ��Most of the Order was there, they��ll look after everyone.�� 

Harry nodded, then remembered that they could not see him, and said, ��Yeah.�� But he thought 
of Ginny, and fear bubbled like acid in his stomach.

 ��Come on, I think we ought to keep moving,�� said Hermione. 

They moved back up the side street and onto the main road again, where a group of men on the 

opposite side was singing and weaving across the pavement.

 ��Just as a matter of interest, why Tottenham Court Road?�� Ron asked Hermione. 

��I��ve no idea, it just popped into my head, but I��m sure we��re safer out in the Muggle world, 

it��s not where they��ll expect us to be.��

 ��True,�� said Ron, looking around, ��but don��t you feel a bit �C exposed?��

 ��Where else is there?�� asked Hermione, cringing as the men on the other side of the road started 
wolf-whistling at her. ��We can hardly book rooms at the Leaky Cauldron, can we? And 
Grimmauld Place is out if Snape can get in there... I suppose we could try my parents�� home, 
though I think there��s a chance they might check there... Oh, I wish they��d shut up!�� 

��All right, darling?�� the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling. ��Fancy a 
drink? Ditch ginger (reddish brown color) and come and have a pint!�� 

��Let��s sit down somewhere,�� Hermione said hastily as Ron opened his mouth to shout back 
across the road. ��Look, this will do, in here!�� 

It was a small and shabby all-night caf��. A light layer of grease lay on all the Formica-topped 
tables, but it was at least empty. Harry slipped into a booth first and Ron sat next to him opposite 
Hermione, who had her back to the entrance and did not like it, she glanced over her shoulder so 
frequently she appeared to have a twitch�鴤 . Harry did not like being stationary; walking had 
given the illusion that they had a goal. Beneath the Cloak he could feel the last vestiges of 
Polyjuice leaving him, his hands returning to their usual length and shape. He pulled his glasses 
out of his pocket and put them on again. 

After a minute or two, Ron said, ��You know, we��re not far from the Leaky Cauldron here, it��s 

only in Charing Cross �C��

 ��Ron, we can��t!�� said Hermione at once.

 ��Not to stay there, but to find out what��s going on!��

��118ҳ��

��We know what��s going on! Voldemort��s taken over the Ministry, what else do we need to 
know?��

 ��Okay, okay, it was just an idea!�� They relapsed into a prickly silence. 

The gum-chewing waitress shuffled over and Hermione ordered two cappuccinos, As Harry 
was invisible, it would have looked odd to order him one. A pair of burly workmen entered the 
caf�� and squeezed into the next booth. Hermione dropped her voice to a whisper. 

��I say we find a quiet place to Disapparate and head for the countryside. Once we��re there, we 

could send a message to the Order.��

 ��Can you do that talking Patronus thing, then?�� asked Ron. 

 ��I��ve been practicing and I think so,�� said Hermione. 

��Well, as long as it doesn��t get them into trouble, though they might��ve been arrested already. 
God, that��s revolting,�� Ron added after one sip of the foamy, grayish coffee. The waitress had 
heard; she shot Ron a nasty look as she shuffled off to take the new customers�� orders. The larger 
of the two workmen, who was blond and quite huge, now that Harry came to look at him, waved 
her away. She stared, affronted. 

��Let��s get going, then, I don��t want to drink this muck,�� said Ron. ��Hermione, have you got 
Muggle money to pay for this?�� 

��Yes, I took out all my Building Society savings before I came to the Burrow. I��ll bet all the 
change is at the bottom,�� sighed Hermione, reaching for her beaded bag. 

The two workmen made identical movements, and Harry mirrored them without conscious 
thought, all three of them drew their wands. Ron, a few seconds late in realizing what was going 
on, lunged across the table, pushing Hermione sideways onto her bench. The force of the Death 
Eaters�� spells shattered the tiled wall where Ron��s head had just been, as Harry, still invisible, 
yelled, ��Stupefy!�� 

The great blond Death Eater was hit in the face by a jet of red light, He slumped sideways, 
unconscious. His companion, unable to see who had cast the spell, fired another at Ron, Shining 
black ropes flew from his wand-tip and bound Ron head to foot �C the waitress screamed and ran 
for the door �C Harry sent another Stunning Spell at the Death Eater with the twisted face who had 
tied up Ron, but the spell missed, rebounded on the window, and hit the waitress, who collapsed in 
front of the door. 

��119ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Expulso!�� bellowed the Death Eater, and the table behind which Harry was standing blew up. 
The force of the explosion slammed him into the wall and he felt his wand leave his hand as the 
Cloak slipped off him. 

��Petrificus Totalus!�� screamed Hermione from out of sight, and the Death Eater fell forward 
like a statue to land with a crunching thud on the mess of broken china, table, and coffee. 
Hermione crawled out from underneath the bench, shaking bits of glass ashtray out of her hair and 
trembling all over. 

��D-diffindo,�� she said, pointing her wand at Ron, who roared in pain as she slashed open the 
knee of his jeans, leaving a deep cut. ��Oh, I��m so sorry, Ron, my hand��s shaking! Diffindo!�� 

The severed ropes fell away. Ron got to his feet, shaking his arms to regain feeling in them. 
Harry picked up his wand and climbed over all the debris to where the large blond Death Eater was 
sprawled across the bench. 

��I should��ve recognized him, he was there the night Dumbledore died,�� he said. He turned over 
the darker Death Eater with his foot; the man��s eyes moved rapidly between Harry, Ron and 
Hermione. 

��That��s Dolohov,�� said Ron. ��I recognize him from the old wanted posters. I think the big one��s 
Thorfinn Rowle.�� 

��Never mind what they��re called!�� said Hermione a little hysterically. ��How did they find us? 
What are we going to do?��

 Somehow her panic seemed to clear Harry��s head.

 ��Lock the door,�� he told her, ��and Ron, turn out the lights.�� 

He looked down at the paralyzed Dolohov, thinking fast as the lock clicked and Ron used the 
Deluminator to plunge the caf�� into darkness. Harry could hear the men who had jeered at 
Hermione earlier, yelling at another girl in the distance. 

��What are we going to do with them?�� Ron whispered to Harry through the dark; then, even 
more quietly, ��Kill them? They��d kill us. They had a good go just now.��

 Hermione shuddered and took a step backward. Harry shook his head. 

��We just need to wipe their memories,�� said Harry. ��It��s better like that, it��ll throw them off the 
scent. If we killed them it��d be obvious we were here.�� 

��You��re the boss,�� said Ron, sounding profoundly relieved. ��But I��ve never done a Memory

Charm.��

 ��Nor have I,�� said Hermione, ��but I know the theory.�� 

She took a deep, calming breath, then pointed her wand at Dolohov��s forehead and said, 

��Obliviate.��

 At once, Dolohov��s eyes became unfocused and dreamy. 

��Brilliant!�� said Harry, clapping her on the back. ��Take care of the other one and the waitress 

while Ron and I clear up.�� 

��Clear up?�� said Ron, looking around at the partly destroyed caf��. ��Why?�� 

��Don��t you think they might wonder what��s happened if they wake up and find themselves in a 

place that looks like it��s just been bombed?��

 ��Oh right, yeah ...��

 Ron struggled for a moment before managing to extract his wand from his pocket.

 ��It��s no wonder I can��t get it out, Hermione, you packed my old jeans, they��re tight.�� 

��Oh, I��m so sorry,�� hissed Hermione, and as she dragged the waitress out of sight of the 
windows, Harry heard her mutter a suggestion as to where Ron could stick his wand instead. 

Once the caf�� was restored to its previous condition, they heaved the Death Eaters back into 
their booth and propped them up facing each other. ��But how did they find us?�� Hermione asked, 
looking from one inert man to the other. ��How did they know where we were?��

 She turned to Harry.

 ��You �C you don��t think you��ve still got your Trace on you, do you, Harry?�� 

��He can��t have,�� said Ron. ��The Trace breaks at seventeen, that��s Wizarding law, you can��t put 
it on an adult.��

 ��As far as you know,�� said Hermione. ��What if the Death Eaters have found a way to put it on a 
seventeen-year-old?�� 

��But Harry hasn��t been near a Death Eater in the last twenty-four hours. Who��s supposed to 
have put a Trace back on him?�� 

Hermione did not reply. Harry felt contaminated, tainted. Was that really how the Death Eaters 
had found them? 

��If I can��t use magic, and you can��t use magic near me, without us giving away our position �C �� 
he began. 

��121ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We��re not splitting up!�� said Hermione firmly.

 ��We need a safe place to hide,�� said Ron. ��Give us time to think things through.��

 ��Grimmauld Place,�� said Harry.

 The other two gaped.

 ��Don��t be silly, Harry, Snape can get in there!�� 

��Ron��s dad said they��ve put up jinxes against him �C and even if they haven��t worked,�� he 
pressed on as Hermione began to argue ��so what? I swear, I��d like nothing better than to meet 

Snape!��

 ��But �C�� 

��Hermione, where else is there? It��s the best chance we��ve got. Snape��s only one Death Eater. 

If I��ve still got the Trace on me, we��ll have whole crowds of them on us wherever else we go.�� 

She could not argue, though she looked as if she would have liked to. While she unlocked the 
caf�� door, Ron clicked the Deluminator to release the caf����s light. Then, on Harry��s count of three, 
they reversed the spells upon their three victims, and before the waitress or either of the Death 
Eaters could do more than stir sleepily, Harry, Ron and Hermione had turned on the spot and 
vanished into the compressing darkness once more. 

Seconds later Harry��s lungs expanded gratefully and he opened his eyes. They were now 
standing in the middle of a familiar small and shabby square. Tall, dilapidated houses looked down 
on them from every side. Number twelve was visible to them, for they had been told of its 
existence by Dumbledore, its Secret-Keeper, and they rushed toward it, checking every few yards 
that they were not being followed or observed. They raced up the stone steps, and Harry tapped the 
front door once with his wand. They heard a series of metallic clicks and the clatter of a chain, then 
the door swung open with a creak and they hurried over the threshold. 

As Harry closed the door behind them, the old-fashioned gas lamps sprang into life, casting 
flickering light along the length of the hallway. It looked just as Harry remembered it, eerie, 
cobwebbed, the outlines of the house-elf heads on the wall throwing odd shadows up the staircase. 
Long dark curtains concealed the portrait of Sirius��s mother. The only thing that was out of place 
was the troll��s leg umbrella stand, which was lying on its side as if Tonks had just knocked it over 
again.

 ��I think somebody��s been in here,�� Hermione whispered, pointing toward it.

��122ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��That could��ve happened as the Order left,�� Ron murmured back.

 ��So where are these jinxes they put up against Snape?�� Harry asked.

 ��Maybe they��re only activated if he shows up?�� suggested Ron. 

Yet they remained close together on the doormat, backs against the door, scared to move farther 
into the house. 

 ��Well, we can��t stay here forever,�� said Harry, and he took a step forward. 

��Severus Snape?�� 

Mad-Eye Moody��s voice whispered out of the darkness, making all three of them jump back in 

fright. 

��We��re not Snape!�� croaked Harry, before something whooshed over him like cold air and his 
tongue curled backward on itself, making it impossible to speak. Before he had time to feel inside 
his mouth, however, his tongue had unraveled again. 

The other two seemed to have experienced the same unpleasant sensation. Ron was making 
retching noises; Hermione stammered, ��That m-must have b-been the T-Tongue-Tying Curse 
Mad-Eye set up for Snape!�� 

Gingerly Harry took another step forward. Something shifted in the shadows at the end of the 
hall, and before any of them could say another word, a figure had risen up out of the carpet, tall, 
dust-colored, and terrible; Hermione screamed and so did Mrs. Black, her curtains flying open; the 
gray figure was gliding toward them, faster and faster, its waist-length hair and beard streaming 
behind it, its face sunken, fleshless, with empty eye sockets, horribly familiar, dreadfully altered, it 
raised a wasted arm, pointing at Harry. 

��No!�� Harry shouted, and though he had raised his wand no spell occurred to him. ��No! It 
wasn��t us! We didn��t kill you �C�� 

On the word kill, the figure exploded in a great cloud of dust, Coughing, his eyes watering, 
Harry looked around to see Hermione crouched on the floor by the door with her arms over her 
head, and Ron, who was shaking from head to foot, patting her clumsily on the shoulder and 
saying, ��It��s all r-right... It��s g-gone... �� 

Dust swirled around Harry like mist, catching the blue gaslight, as Mrs. Black continued to 
scream.

 ��Mudbloods, filth, stains of dishonor, taint of shame on the house of my fathers �C��

��123ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��SHUT UP!�� Harry bellowed, directing his wand at her, and with a bang and a burst of red 
sparks, the curtains swung shut again, silencing her. 

 ��That ... that was ...�� Hermione whimpered, as Ron helped her to her feet. 

��Yeah,�� said Harry, ��but it wasn��t really him, was it? Just something to scare Snape.�� 

Had it worked, Harry wondered, or had Snape already blasted the horror-figure aside as casually 
as he had killed the real Dumbledore? Nerves still tingling, he led the other two up the hall, half-
expecting some new terror to reveal itself, but nothing moved except for a mouse skittering along 
the skirting board���ڰ�, �Ű�=baseboard. 

��Before we go any farther, I think we��d better check,�� whispered Hermione, and she raised her 

wand and said, ��Homenum revelio.��

 Nothing happened. 

 ��Well, you��ve just had a big shock,�� said Ron kindly. ��What was that supposed to do?�� 

��It did what I meant it to do!�� said Hermione rather crossly. ��That was a spell to reveal human 
presence, and there��s nobody here except us!�� 

��And old Dusty,�� said Ron, glancing at the patch of carpet from which the corpse-figure had 
risen. 

��Let��s go up,�� said Hermione with a frightened look at the same spot, and she led the way up 
the creaking stairs to the drawing room on the first floor. 

Hermione waved her wand to ignite the old gas lamps, then, shivering slightly in the drafty 
room, she perched on the sofa, her arms wrapped tightly around her. Ron crossed to the window 
and moved the heavy velvet curtains aside an inch. 

��Can��t see anyone out there,�� he reported. ��And you��d think, if Harry still had a Trace on him, 
they��d have followed us here. I know they can��t get in the house, but �C what��s up, Harry?�� 

Harry had given a cry of pain. His scar had burned again as something flashed across his mind 
like a bright light on water. He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own pound 
through his body, violent and brief as an electric shock. 

 ��What did you see?�� Ron asked, advancing on Harry. ��Did you see him at my place?��

 ��No, I just felt anger �C he��s really angry �C�� 

��But that could be at the Burrow,�� said Ron loudly. ��What else? Didn��t you see anything? Was 
he cursing someone?��

��124ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No, I just felt anger �C I couldn��t tell �C�� 

Harry felt badgered, confused, and Hermione did not help as she said in a frightened voice, 
��Your scar, again? But what��s going on? I thought that connection had closed!�� 

��It did, for a while,�� muttered Harry; his scar was still painful, which made it hard to 
concentrate. ��I �C I think it��s started opening again whenever he loses control, that��s how it used to 
�C�� 

��But then you��ve got to close your mind!�� said Hermione shrilly. ��Harry, Dumbledore didn��t 
want you to use that connection, he wanted you to shut it down, that��s why you were supposed to 
use Occlumency! Otherwise Voldemort can plant false images in your mind, remember �C�� 

��Yeah, I do remember, thanks,�� said Harry through gritted teeth; he did not need Hermione to 
tell him that Voldemort had once used this selfsame (identical, exactly the same) connection 
between them to lead him into a trap, nor that it had resulted in Sirius��s death. He wished that he 
had not told them what he had seen and felt; it made Voldemort more threatening, as though he 
were pressing against the window of the room, and still the pain in his scar was building and he 
fought it. It was like resisting the urge to be sick. 

He turned his back on Ron and Hermione, pretending to examine the old tapestry of the Black 
family tree on the wall. Then Hermione shrieked, Harry drew his wand again and spun around to 
see a silver Patronus soar through the drawing room window and land upon the floor in front of 
them, where it solidified into the weasel that spoke with the voice of Ron��s father.

 ��Family safe, do not reply, we are being watched.�� 

The Patronus dissolved into nothingness. Ron let out a noise between a whimper and a groan 
and dropped onto the sofa, Hermione joined him, gripping his arm.

 ��They��re all right, they��re all right!�� she whispered, and Ron half laughed and hugged her. 

 ��Harry,�� he said over Hermione��s shoulder, ��I �C�� 

��It��s not a problem,�� said Harry, sickened by the pain in his head. ��It��s your family, 'course you 

were worried. I��d feel the same way.�� He thought of Ginny. ��I do feel the same way.�� 

The pain in his scar was reaching a peak, burning as it had back in the garden of the Burrow. 
Faintly he heard Hermione say ��I don��t want to be on my own. Could we use the sleeping bags 
I��ve brought and camp in here tonight?��

 He heard Ron agree. He could not fight the pain much longer. He had to succumb.

��125ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Bathroom,�� he muttered, and he left the room as fast as he could without running. 

He barely made it. Bolting the door behind him with trembling hands, he grasped his pounding 
head and fell to the floor, then in an explosion of agony, he felt the rage that did not belong to him 
possess his soul, saw a long room lit only by firelight, and the giant blond Death Eater on the floor, 
screaming and writhing, and a slighter figure standing over him, wand outstretched, while Harry 
spoke in a high, cold, merciless voice. 

��More, Rowle, or shall we end it and feed you to Nagini? Lord Voldemort is not sure that he 
will forgive this time... You called me back for this, to tell me that Harry Potter has escaped again? 
Draco, give Rowle another taste of our displeasure... Do it, or feel my wrath yourself!�� 

A log fell in the fire, flames reared, their light darting across a terrified, pointed white face �C 
with a sense of emerging from deep water, Harry drew heaving breaths and opened his eyes. 

He was spread-eagled on the cold black marble floor, his nose inches from one of the silver 
serpent tails that supported the large bathtub. He sat up. Malfoy��s gaunt, petrified face seemed 
burned on the inside of his eyes. Harry felt sickened by what he had seen, by the use to which 
Draco was now being put by Voldemort.

 There was a sharp rap on the door, and Harry jumped as Hermione��s voice rang out.

 ��Harry, do you want your toothbrush? I��ve got it here.��

 ��Yeah, great, thanks,�� he said, fighting to keep his voice casual as he stood up to let her in.

Chapter Ten 
Kreacher��s Tale 


Harry woke early next morning, 


wrapped 
in a sleeping bag on the drawing room 

floor. A 
chink of sky was visible between the 

heavy 
curtains. It was the cool, clear blue of 

watered 
ink, somewhere between night and 

dawn, 
and everything was quiet except for Ron 

and 
Hermione��s slow, deep breathing. Harry 

glanced 
over at the dark shapes they made on the floor beside him. Ron had had a fit of gallantry and 
insisted that Hermione sleep on the cushions from the sofa, so that her silhouette was raised above 
his. Her arm curved to the floor, her fingers inches from Ron��s. Harry wondered whether they had 
fallen asleep holding hands. The idea made him feel strangely lonely. 

He looked up at the shadowy ceiling, the cobwebbed chandelier. Less than twenty-four house 
ago, he had been standing in the sunlight at the entrance to the marquee, waiting to show in 
wedding guests. It seemed a lifetime away. What was going to happen now? He lay on the floor 
and he thought of the Horcruxes, of the daunting (intimidating, awesome) complex mission 
Dumbledore had left him... Dumbledore... 

The grief that had possessed him since Dumbledore��s death felt different now. The accusations 
he had heard from Muriel at the wedding seemed to have nested in his brain like diseased things, 
infecting his memories of the wizard he had idolized. Could Dumbledore have let such things 
happen? Had he been like Dudley, content to watch neglect and abuse as long as it did not affect 
him? Could he have turned his back on a sister who was being imprisoned and hidden? 

Harry thought of Godric��s Hollow, of graves Dumbledore had never mentioned there; he 
thought of mysterious objects left without explanation in Dumbledore��s will, and resentment 
swelled in the darkness. Why hadn��t Dumbledore told him? Why hadn��t he explained? Had 
Dumbledore actually cared about Harry at all? Or had Harry been nothing more than a tool to be 
polished and honed, but not trusted, never confided in?

��127ҳ��

Harry could not stand lying there with nothing but bitter thoughts for company. Desperate for 
something to do, for distraction, he slipped out of his sleeping bad, picked up his wand, and crept 
out of the room. On the landing he whispered, ��Lumos,�� and started to climb the stairs by 
wandlight. 

On the second landing was the bedroom in which he and Ron had slept last time they had been 
here; he glanced into it. The wardrobe doors stood open and the bedclothes������Ʒ had been 
ripped back. Harry remembered the overturned troll leg downstairs. Somebody had searched the 
house since the Order had left. Snape? Or perhaps Mundungus, who had pilfered plenty from this 
house both before and after Sirius died? Harry��s gaze wandered to the portrait that sometimes 
contained Phineas Nigellus Black, Sirius��s great-great grandfather, but it was empty, showing 
nothing but a stretch of muddy backdrop. Phineas Nigellus was evidently spending the night in the 
headmaster��s study at Hogwarts. 

Harry continued up the stairs until he reached the topmost landing where there were only two 
doors. The one facing him bore a nameplate reading Sirius. Harry had never entered his 
godfather��s bedroom before. He pushed open the door, holding his wand high to cast light as 
widely as possible. The room was spacious and must once have been handsome. There was a large 
bed with a carved wooden headboard, a tall window obscured by long velvet curtains and a 
chandelier thickly coated in dust with candle scrubs still resting in its sockets, solid wax hanging in 
frostlike drips. A fine film of dust covered the pictures on the walls and the bed��s headboard; a 
spiders web stretched between the chandelier and the top of the large wooden wardrobe, and as 
Harry moved deeper into the room, he head a scurrying of disturbed mice. 

The teenage Sirius had plastered the walls with so many posters and pictures that little of the 
wall��s silvery-gray silk was visible. Harry could only assume that Sirius��s parents had been unable 
to remove the Permanent Sticking Charm that kept them on the wall because he was sure they 
would not have appreciated their eldest son��s taste in decoration. Sirius seemed to have long gone 
out of his way to annoy his parents. There were several large Gryffindor banners, faded scarlet and 
gold just to underline his difference from all the rest of the Slytherin family. There were many 
pictures of Muggle motorcycles, and also (Harry had to admire Sirius��s nerve) several posters of 
bikini-clad Muggle girls. Harry could tell that they were Muggles because they remained quite

��128ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

stationary within their pictures, faded smiles and glazed eyes frozen on the paper. This was in 
contrast to the only Wizarding photograph on the walls which was a picture of four Hogwarts 
students standing arm in arm, laughing at the camera. 

With a leap of pleasure, Harry recognized his father, his untidy black hair stuck up at the back 
like Harry��s, and he too wore glasses. Beside him was Sirius, carelessly handsome, his slightly 
arrogant face so much younger and happier than Harry had ever seen it alive. To Sirius��s right 
stood Pettigrew, more than a head shorter, plump and watery-eyed, flushed with pleasure at his 
inclusion in this coolest of gangs, with the much-admired rebels that James and Sirius had been. 
On James��s left was Lupin, even then a little shabby-looking, but he had the same air of delighted 
surprise at finding himself liked and included or was it simply because Harry knew how it had 
been, that he saw these things in the picture? He tried to take it from the wall; it was his now, after 
all, Sirius had left him everything, but it would not budge. Sirius had taken no chances in 
preventing his parents from redecorating his room. 

Harry looked around at the floor. The sky outside was growing brightest. A shaft of light 
revealed bits of paper, books, and small objects scattered over the carpet. Evidently Sirius��s 
bedroom had been searched too, although its contents seemed to have been judged mostly, if not 
entirely, worthless. A few of the books had been shaken roughly enough to part company with the 
covers and sundry���ֵ� pages littered the floor. 

Harry bent down, picked up a few of the pieces of paper, and examined them. He recognized 
one as a part of an old edition of A History of Magic, by Bathilda Bagshot, and another as 
belonging to a motorcycle maintenance manual. The third was handwritten and crumpled. He 
smoothed it out. 

Dear Padfoot,

 Thank you, thank you, for Harry��s birthday present! It was his favorite by far. One year old and 
already zooming along on a toy broomstick, he looked so pleased with himself. I��m enclosing a 
picture so you can see. You know it only rises about two feet off the ground but he nearly killed the 
cat and he smashed a horrible vase Petunia sent me for Christmas (no complaints there). Of 
course James thought it was so funny, says he��s going to be a great Quidditch player but we��ve 
had to pack away all the ornaments and make sure we don��t take our eyes off him when he gets

going. 

We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old Bathilda who has always been sweet to us and 
who dotes�簮 on Harry. We were so sorry you couldn��t come, but the Order��s got to come first, 
and Harry��s not old enough to know it��s his birthday anyway! James is getting a bit frustrated shut 
up here, he tries not to show it but I can tell �C also Dumbledore��s still got his Invisibility Cloak, so 
no chance of little excursions. If you could visit, it would cheer him up so much. Wormy was here 
last weekend. I thought he seemed down, but that was probably the news about the McKinnons; I 
cried all evening when I heard. 

Bathilda drops in most days, she��s a fascinating old thing with the most amazing stories about 
Dumbledore. I��m not sure he��d be pleased if he knew! I don��t know how much to believe, actually 
because it seems incredible that Dumbledore 

Harry��s extremities seemed to have gone numb. He stood quite still, holding the miraculous 
paper in his nerveless fingers while inside him a kind of quiet eruptions sent joy and grief 
thundering its equal measure through his veins. Lurching to the bed, he sat down. 

He read the letter again, but could not take in any more meaning than he had done the first time, 
and was reduced to staring at the handwriting itself. She had made her ��g��s the same way he did. 
He searched through the letter for every one of them, and each felt like a friendly little wave 
glimpsed from behind a veil. The letter was an incredible treasure, proof that Lily Potter had lived, 
really lived, that her warm hand had once moved across this parchment, tracing ink into these 
letters, these words, words about him, Harry, her son. 

Impatiently brushing away the wetness in his eyes, he reread the letter, this time concentrating 
on the meaning. It was like listening to a half-remembered voice.

 They had a cat... perhaps it had perished, like his parents at Godric��s Hollow... or else fled when 
there was nobody left to feed it... Sirius had bought him his first broomstick... His parents had 
known Bathilda Bagshot; had Dumbledore introduced them? Dumbledore��s still got his Invisibility 
Cloak... there was something funny there... 

Harry paused, pondering his mother��s words. Why had Dumbledore taken James��s Invisibility 
Cloak? Harry distinctly remembered his headmaster telling him years before, ��I don��t need a cloak 
to become invisible��. Perhaps some less gifted Order member had needed its assistance, and 
Dumbledore had acted as a carrier? Harry passed on...

Wormy was here... Pettigrew, the traitor, had seemed ��down�� had he? Was he aware that he was 
seeing James and Lily alive for the last time? 

And finally Bathilda again, who told incredible stories about Dumbledore. It seems incredible 
that Dumbledore 


That Dumbledore what? But there were any number of things that would seem incredible about 
Dumbledore; that he had once received bottom marks in a Transfiguration test, for instance or had 
taken up goat charming like Aberforth... 

Harry got to his feet and scanned the floor, Perhaps the rest of the letter was here somewhere. 
He seized papers, treating them in his eagerness, with as little consideration as the original 
searcher, he pulled open drawers, shook out books, stood on a chair to run his hand over the top of 
the wardrobe, and crawled under the bed and armchair. 

At last, lying facedown on the floor, he spotted what looked like a torn piece of paper under the 
chest of drawers. When he pulled it out, it proved to be most of the photograph that Lily had 
described in her letter. A black-haired baby was zooming in and out of the picture on a tiny broom, 
roaring with laughter, and a pair of legs that must have belonged to James was chasing after him. 
Harry tucked the photograph into his pocket with Lily��s letter and continued to look for the second 
sheet. 

After another quarter of an hour, however he was forced to conclude that the rest of his 
mother��s letter was gone. Had it simply been lost in the sixteen years that had elapsed since it had 
been written, or had it been taken by whoever had searched the room? Harry read the first sheet 
again, this time looking for clues as to what might have made the second sheet valuable. His toy 
broomstick could hardly be considered interesting to the Death Eaters... The only potentially useful 
thing he could see her was possible information on Dumbledore. It seems incredible that 
Dumbledore �C what? 

��Harry? Harry? Harry!�� 

��I��m here!�� he called, ��What��s happened?�� 

There was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and Hermione burst inside. 

��We woke up and didn��t know where you were!�� she said breathlessly. She turned and shouted 
over her shoulder, ��Ron! I��ve found him�� 

Ron��s annoyed voice echoed distantly from several floors below.

��Good! Tell him from me he��s a git!�� 

��Harry, don��t just disappear, please, we were terrified! Why did you come up here anyway?�� 
She gazed around the ransacked room. ��What have you been doing?�� 

��Look what I��ve just found.�� 

He held out his mother��s letter. Hermione took it out and read it while Harry watched her. When 

she reached the end of the page she looked up at him. 

��Oh Harry...�� 

��And there��s this too.�� 

He handed her the torn photograph, and Hermione smiled at the baby zooming in and out of 

sight on the toy broom. 

��I��ve been looking for the rest of the letter,�� Harry said, ��but it��s not here.�� 

Hermione glanced around. 

��Did you make all this mess, or was some of it done when you got here?�� 

��Someone had searched before me,�� said Harry. 

��I thought so. Every room I looked into on the way up had been disturbed. What were they after, 

do you think?�� 

��Information on the Order, if it was Snape.�� 

��But you��d think he��d already have all he needed. I mean he was in the Order, wasn��t he?�� 

��Well then,�� said Harry, keen to discuss his theory, ��what about information on Dumbledore? 

The second page of the letter, for instance. You know this Bathilda my mum mentions, you know 

who she is?�� 

��Who?�� 

��Bathilda Bagshot, the author of �C�� 

��A History of Magic,�� said Hermione, looking interested. ��So your parents knew her? She was 

an incredible magic historian.�� 

��And she��s still alive,�� said Harry, ��and she lives in Godric��s Hollow. Ron��s Auntie Muriel was 
talking about her at the wedding. She knew Dumbledore��s family too. Be pretty interesting to talk 
to, wouldn��t she?�� 

There was a little too much understanding in the smile Hermione gave him for Harry��s liking. 
He took back the letter and the photograph and tucked them inside the pouch around his neck, so

��132ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

as not to have to look at her and give himself away. 

��I understand why you��d love to talk to her about your mum and dad, and Dumbledore too,�� 
said Hermione. ��But that wouldn��t really help us in our search for the Horcruxes, would it?�� 

Harry did not answer, and she rushed on, ��Harry, I know you really want to go to Godric��s 
Hollow, but I��m scared. I��m scared at how easily those Death Eaters found us yesterday. It just 
makes me feel more than ever that we ought to avoid the place where your parents are buried, I��m 
sure they��d be expecting you to visit it.�� 

��It��s not just that,�� Harry said, still avoiding looking at her, ��Muriel said stuff about 
Dumbledore at the wedding. I want to know the truth...�� 

He told Hermione everything that Muriel had told him. When he had finished, Hermione said, 
��Of course, I can see why that��s upset you, Harry �C��

 ��I��m not upset,�� he lied, ��I��d just like to know whether or not it��s true or �C�� 

��Harry do you really think you��ll get the truth from a malicious old woman like Muriel, or from 

Rita Skeeter? How can you believe them? You knew Dumbledore!��

 ��I thought I did,�� he muttered. 

��But you know how much truth there was in everything Rita wrote about you! Doge is right, 
how can you let these people tarnish your memories of Dumbledore?�� 

He looked away, trying not to betray the resentment he felt. There it was again, choose what to 
believe. He wanted the truth. Why was everybody so determined that he should not get it? 

��Shall we go down to the kitchen?�� Hermione suggested after a little pause. ��Find something 
for breakfast?�� 

He agreed, but grudgingly, and followed her out onto the landing and past the second door that 
led off it. There were deep scratch marks in the paintwork below a small sign that he had not 
noticed in the dark. He passed at the top of the stairs to read it. It was a pompous little sign, neatly 
lettered by hand, the sort of thing that Percy Weasley might have stuck on his bedroom door. 

Do Not Enter 
Without the Express Permission of 
Regulus Arcturus Black


��133ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Excitement trickled through Harry, but he was not immediately sure why. He read the sign 

again. Hermione was already a flight of stairs below him.

 ��Hermione,�� he said, and he was surprised that his voice was so calm. ��Come back up here.��

 ��What��s the matter?��

 ��R.A.B. I think I��ve found him.��

 There was a gasp, and then Hermione ran back up the stairs. 

 ��In your mum��s letter? But I didn��t see �C��

 Harry shook his head, pointing at Regulus��s sign. 

She read it, then clutched Harry��s arm so tightly that he winced. 

 ��Sirius��s brother?�� she whispered. 

 ��He was a Death Eater,�� said Harry. ��Sirius told me about him, he joined up when he was really 
young and then got cold feet and tried to leave �C so they killed him.�� 

��That fits!�� gasped Hermione. ��If he was a Death Eater he had access to Voldemort, and if he 

became disenchanted, then he would have wanted to bring Voldemort down!��

 She released Harry, leaned over the banister, and screamed, ��Ron! RON! Get up here, quick!��

 Ron appeared, panting, a minute later, his wand ready in his hand. 

 ��What��s up? If it��s massive spiders again I want breakfast before I �C��

 He frowned at the sign on Regulus��s door, in which Hermione was silently pointing. 

��What? That was Sirius��s brother, wasn��t it? Regulus Arcturus ... Regulus ... R.A.B.! The locket 

�C you don��t reckon - ?�� 
��Let��s find out,�� said Harry. He pushed the door. It was locked. Hermione pointed her wand at 
the handle and said, ��Alohamora.�� There was a click, and the door swung open. 
They moved over the threshold together, gazing around. Regulus��s bedroom was slightly 
smaller than Sirius��s, though it had the same sense of former grandeur. Whereas Sirius had sought 
to advertise his diffidence from the rest of the family, Regulus had striven to emphasize the 
opposite. The Slytherin colors of emerald and silver were everywhere, draping the bed, the walls, 
and the windows. The Black family crest was painstakingly painted over the bed, along with its 
motto, TOUJOURS PUR. Beneath this was a collection of yellow newspaper cuttings, all stuck 
together to make a ragged collage����������. Hermione crossed the room to examine them. 

��They��re all about Voldemort,�� she said. ��Regulus seems to have been a fan for a few years

��134ҳ��

before he joined the Death Eaters ...�� 

A little puff of dust rose from the bedcovers as she sat down to read the clippings. Harry, 
meanwhile, had noticed another photograph, a Hogwarts Quidditch team was smiling and waving 
out of the frame. He moved closer and saw the snakes emblazoned on their chests, Slytherins. 
Regulus was instantly recognizable as the boy sitting in the middle of the front row, He had the 
same dark hair and slightly haughty look of his brother, though he was smaller, slighter, and rather 
less handsome than Sirius had been. 

 ��He played Seeker,�� said Harry. 

��What?�� said Hermione vaguely; she was still immersed in Voldemort��s press clippings. 

��He��s sitting in the middle of the front row, that��s where the Seeker ... Never mind,�� said Harry, 
realizing that nobody was listening. Ron was on his hands and knees, searching under the 
wardrobe. Harry looked around the room for likely hiding places and approached the desk. Yet 
again, somebody had searched before them. The drawers�� contents had been turned over recently, 
the dust disturbed, but there was nothing of value there, old quills, out-of-date textbooks that bore 
evidence of being roughly handled, a recently smashed ink bottle, its sticky residue covering the 
contents of the drawer. 

��There��s an easier way,�� said Hermione, as Harry wiped his inky fingers on his jeans. She 
raised her wand and said, ��Accio Locket!�� 

Nothing happened. Ron, who had been searching the folds of the faded curtains, looked 
disappointed.

 ��Is that it, then? It��s not here?�� 

��Oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments,�� said Hermione. ��Charms to 
prevent it from being summoned magically, you know.�� 

��Like Voldemort put on the stone basin in the cave,�� said Harry, remembering how he had been 
unable to Summon the fake locket.

 ��How are we supposed to find it then?�� asked Ron. 

 ��We search manually,�� said Hermione. 

��That��s a good idea,�� said Ron, rolling his eyes, and he resumed his examination of the 
curtains. 

They combed every inch of the room for more than an hour, but were forced, finally, to

��135ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

conclude that the locket was not there.

 The sun had risen now; its light dazzled them even through the grimy landing windows. 

��It could be somewhere else in the house, though,�� said Hermione in a rallying tone as they 
walked back downstairs. As Harry and Ron had become more discouraged, she seemed to have 
become more determined. ��Whether he��d manage to destroy it or not, he��d want to keep it hidden 
from Voldemort, wouldn��t he? Remember all those awful things we had to get rid of when we 
were here last time? That clock that shot bolts at everyone and those old robes that tried to strangle 
Ron; Regulus might have put them there to protect the locket��s hiding place, even though we 
didn��t realize it at ... at ... �� 

Harry and Ron looked at her. She was standing with one foot in midair, with the dumbstruck 

look of one who had just been Obliviated, her eyes had even drifted out of focus. 

 ��... at the time,�� she finished in a whisper. 

 ��Something wrong?�� asked Ron. 

 ��There was a locket.��

 ��What?�� said Harry and Ron together.

 ��In the cabinet in the drawing room. Nobody could open it. And we ... we ... �� 

Harry felt as though a brick had slid down through his chest into his stomach. He remembered. 
He had even handled the thing as they passed it around, each trying in turn to pry it open. It had 
been tossed into a sack of rubbish, along with the snuffbox of Wartcap powder and the music box 
that had made everyone sleepy ...�� 

��Kreacher nicked loads of things back from us,�� said Harry. It was the only chance, the only 
slender hope left to them, and he was going to cling to it until forced to let go. ��He had a whole 
stash of stuff in his cupboard in the kitchen. C��mon.�� 

He ran down the stairs taking two steps at a time, the other two thundering along in his wake. 
They made so much noise that they woke the portrait of Sirius��s mother as they passed through the 
hall. 

��Filth! Mudbloods! Scum!�� she screamed after them as they dashed down into the basement 
kitchen and slammed the door behind them. Harry ran the length of the room, skidded to a halt at 
the door of Kreacher��s cupboard, and wrenched it open. There was the nest of dirty old blankets in 
which the house-elf had once slept, but they were not longer glittering with the trinkets Kreacher

��136ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

had salvaged. The only thing there was an old copy of Nature��s Nobility, A Wizarding Genealogy. 
Refusing to believe his eyes, Harry snatched up the blankets and shook them. A dead mouse fell 
out and rolled dismally across the floor. Ron groaned as he threw himself into a kitchen chair; 
Hermione closed her eyes.

 ��It��s not over yet,�� said Harry, and he raised his voice and called, ��Kreacher!�� 

There was a loud crack and the house elf that Harry had so reluctantly inherited from Sirius 
appeared out of nowhere in front of the cold and empty fireplace, tiny, half human-sized, his pale 
skin hanging off him in folds, white hair sprouting copiously from his batlike ears. He was still 
wearing the filthy rag in which they had first met him, and the contemptuous look he bent upon 
Harry showed that his attitude to his change of ownership had altered no more than his outfit. 

��Master,�� croaked Kreacher in his bullfrog��s voice, and he bowed low; muttering to his knees, 
��back in my Mistress��s old house with the blood-traitor Weasley and the Mudblood �C�� 

��I forbid you to call anyone 'blood traitor' or 'Mudblood,'�� growled Harry. He would have 
found Kreacher, with his snoutlike nose and bloodshot eyes, a distinctively unlovable object even 
if the elf had not betrayed Sirius to Voldemort. 

��I��ve got a question for you,�� said Harry, his heart beating rather fast as he looked down at the 
elf, ��and I order you to answer it truthfully. Understand?�� 

��Yes, Master,�� said Kreacher, bowing low again. Harry saw his lips moving soundlessly, 
undoubtedly framing the insults he was now forbidden to utter. 

��Two years ago,�� said Harry, his heart now hammering against his ribs, ��there was a big gold 
locket in the drawing room upstairs. We threw it out. Did you steal it back?�� 

There was a moment��s silence, during which Kreacher straightened up to look Harry full in the 
face. Then he said, ��Yes.��

 ��Where is it now?�� asked Harry jubilantly as Ron and Hermione looked gleeful.

 Kreacher closed his eyes as though he could not bear to see their reactions to his next word. 

 ��Gone.��

 ��Gone?�� echoed Harry, elation floating out of him, ��What do you mean, it��s gone?��

 The elf shivered. He swayed.

 ��Kreacher,�� said Harry fiercely, ��I order you �C�� 

��Mundungus Fletcher,�� croaked the elf, his eyes still tight shut. ��Mundungus Fletcher stole it

��137ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

all; Miss Bella��s and Miss Cissy��s pictures, my Mistress��s gloves, the Order of Merlin, First Class, 
the goblets with the family crest, and �C and �C �� 

Kreacher was gulping for air, His hollow chest was rising and falling rapidly, then his eyes flew 
open and he uttered a bloodcurdling scream.

 ��- and the locket, Master Regulus��s locket. Kreacher did wrong, Kreacher failed in his orders!�� 

Harry reacted instinctively, as Kreacher lunged for the poker standing in the grate, he launched 
himself upon the elf, flattening him. Hermione��s scream mingled with Kreacher��s but Harry 
bellowed louder than both of them, ��Kreacher, I order you to stay still!�� 

He felt the elf freeze and released him. Kreacher lay flat on the cold stone floor, tears gushing 
from his sagging eyes.

 ��Harry, let him up!�� Hermione whispered. 

��So he can beat himself up with the poker?�� snorted Harry, kneeling beside the elf. ��I don��t 
think so. Right. Kreacher, I want the truth. How do you know Mundungus Fletcher stole the 
locket?�� 

��Kreacher saw him!�� gasped the elf as tears poured over his snout and into his mouth full of 
graying teeth. ��Kreacher saw him coming out of Kreacher��s cupboard with his hands full of 
Kreacher��s treasures. Kreacher told the sneak thief to stop, but Mundungus Fletcher laughed and r-
ran ... �� 

��You called the locket 'Master Regulus��s,'�� said Harry. ��Why? Where did it come from? What 
did Regulus have to do with it? Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, 
and everything Regulus had to do with it!�� 

The elf sat up, curled into a ball, placed his wet face between his knees, and began to rock 
backward and forward. When he spoke, his voice was muffled but quite distinct in the silent, 
echoing kitchen. 

��Master Sirius ran away, good riddance��ϲ�İ��� , for he was a bad boy and broke my 
Mistress��s heart with his lawless ways. But Master Regulus had proper order; he knew what was 
due (suitable) to the name of Black and the dignity of his pure blood. For years he talked of the 
Dark Lord, who was going to bring the wizards out of hiding to rule the Muggles and the Muggleborns 
... and when he was sixteen years old, Master Regulus joined the Dark Lord. So proud, so 
proud, so happy to serve.

��138ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��And one day, a year after he joined, Master Regulus came down to the kitchen to see 

Kreacher. Master Regulus always liked Kreacher. And Master Regulus said ... he said ...��

 The old elf rocked faster than ever.

 ��... he said that the Dark Lord required an elf.�� 

��Voldemort needed an elf?�� Harry repeated, looking around at Ron and Hermione, who looked 

just as puzzled as he did. 

��Oh yes,�� moaned Kreacher. ��And Master Regulus had volunteered Kreacher. It was an honor, 
said Master Regulus, an honor for him and for Kreacher, who must be sure to do whatever the 
Dark Lord ordered him to do ... and then to c-come home.��

 Kreacher rocked still faster, his breath coming in sobs. 

 ��So Kreacher went to the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord did not tell Kreacher what they were to do, 
but took Kreacher with him to a cave beside the sea. And beyond the cave was a cavern, and in the 
cavern was a great black lake...�� 

The hairs on the back of Harry��s neck stood up. Kreacher��s croaking voice seemed to come to 
him from across the dark water. He saw what had happened as clearly as though he had been 
present.

 ��... There was a boat ...�� 

Of course there had been a boat; Harry knew the boat, ghostly green and tiny, bewitched so as 
to carry one wizard and one victim toward the island in the center. This, then, was how Voldemort 
had tested the defenses surrounding the Horcrux, by borrowing a disposable creature, a house-elf...

 ��There was a b-basin full of potion on the island. The D-Dark Lord made Kreacher drink it ...��

 The elf quaked from head to foot. 

 ��Kreacher drank, and as he drank he saw terrible thing ... Kreacher��s insides burned ... Kreacher 
cried for Master Regulus to save him, he cried for his Mistress Black, but the Dark Lord only 
laughed ... He made Kreacher drink all the potion ... He dropped a locket into the empty basin ... 
He filled it with more potion.��

 ��And then the Dark Lord sailed away, leaving Kreacher on the island ... �� 

Harry could see it happening. He watched Voldemort��s white, snakelike face vanishing into 
darkness, those red eyes fixed pitilessly on the thrashing elf whose death would occur within 
minutes, whenever he succumbed to the desperate thirst that the burning poison caused its

��139ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

victim ... But here, Harry��s imagination could go no further, for he could not see how Kreacher had 
escaped. 

��Kreacher needed water, he crawled to the island��s edge and he drank from the black lake ... 
and hands, dead hands, came out of the water and dragged Kreacher under the surface ... ��

 ��How did you get away?�� Harry asked, and he was not surprised to hear himself whispering.

 Kreacher raised his ugly head and looked Harry with his great, bloodshot eyes.

 ��Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,�� he said.

 ��I know �C but how did you escape the Inferi?��

 Kreacher did not seem to understand.

 ��Master Regulus told Kreacher to come back,�� he repeated.

 ��I know, but �C ��

 ��Well, it��s obvious, isn��t it, Harry?�� said Ron. ��He Disapparated!��

 ��But ... you couldn��t Apparate in and out of that cave,�� said Harry, ��otherwise Dumbledore �C�� 

��Elf magic isn��t like wizard��s magic, is it?�� said Ron, ��I mean, they can Apparate and 
Disapparate in and out of Hogwarts when we can��t.�� 

There was a silence as Harry digested this. How could Voldemort have made such a mistake? 
But even as he thought this, Hermione spoke, and her voice was icy. 

��Of course, Voldemort would have considered the ways of house-elves far beneath his notice ... 
It would never have occurred to him that they might have magic that he didn��t.�� 

��The house-elf��s highest law is his Master��s bidding,�� intoned Kreacher. ��Kreacher was told to 
come home, so Kreacher came home ... �� 

��Well, then, you did what you were told, didn��t you?�� said Hermione kindly. ��You didn��t 
disobey orders at all!��

 Kreacher shook his head, rocking as fast as ever. 

��So what happened when you got back?�� Harry asked. ��What did Regulus say when you told 

him what happened?�� 

��Master Regulus was very worried, very worried,�� croaked Kreacher. ��Master Regulus told 
Kreacher to stay hidden and not to leave the house. And then ... it was a little while later ... Master 
Regulus came to find Kreacher in his cupboard one night, and Master Regulus was strange, not as 
he usually was, disturbed in his mind, Kreacher could tell ... and he asked Kreacher to take him to

��140ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the cave, the cave where Kreacher had gone with the Dark Lord ... �� 

And so they had set off. Harry could visualize them quite clearly, the frightened old elf and the 
thin, dark Seeker who had so resembled Sirius ... Kreacher knew how to open the concealed 
entrance to the underground cavern, knew how to raise the tiny boat, this time it was his beloved 
Regulus who sailed with him to the island with its basin of poison ... 

 ��And he made you drink the poison?�� said Harry, disgusted. 

But Kreacher shook his head and wept. Hermione��s hands leapt to her mouth. She seemed to 
have understood something. 

��M-Master Regulus took from his pocket a locket like the one the Dark Lord had,�� said 
Kreacher, tears pouring down either side of his snoutlike nose. ��And he told Kreacher to take it 
and, when the basin was empty, to switch the lockets ...��

 Kreacher��s sobs came in great rasps now; Harry had to concentrate hard to understand him. 

��And he order �C Kreacher to leave �C without him. And he told Kreacher �C to go home �C and 
never to tell my Mistress �C what he had done �C but to destroy �C the first locket. And he drank �C all 
the potion �C and Kreacher swapped the lockets �C and watched ... as Master Regulus ... was dragged 
beneath the water ... and ...��

 ��Oh, Kreacher!�� wailed Hermione, who was crying. She dropped to her knees beside the elf and 

tried to hug him. At once he was on his feet, cringing away from her, quite obviously repulsed.

 ��The Mudblood touched Kreacher, he will not allow it, what would his Mistress say?�� 

��I told you not to call her ��Mudblood��!�� snarled Harry, but the elf was already punishing 
himself. He fell to the ground and banged his forehead on the floor. 

��Stop him �C stop him!�� Hermione cried. ��Oh, don��t you see now how sick it is, the way they��ve 
got to obey?��

 ��Kreacher �C stop, stop!�� shouted Harry. 

The elf lay on the floor, panting and shivering, green mucus glistening around his snort, a 
bruise already blooming on his pallid forehead where he had struck himself, his eyes swollen and 
bloodshot and swimming in tears. Harry had never seen anything so pitiful. 

��So you brought the locket home,�� he said relentlessly, for he was determined to know the full 
story. ��And you tried to destroy it?�� 

��Nothing Kreacher did made any mark upon it,�� moaned the elf. ��Kreacher tried everything,

��141ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

everything he knew, but nothing, nothing would work ... So many powerful spells upon the casing. 
Kreacher was sure the way to destroy it was to get inside it, but it would not open ... Kreacher 
punished himself, he tried again, he punished himself, he tried again. Kreacher failed to obey 
orders, Kreacher could not destroy the locket! And his mistress was mad with grief, because 
Master Regulus had disappeared and Kreacher could not tell her what had happened, no, because 
Master Regulus had f-f-forbidden him to tell any of the f-f-family what happened in the c-cave ...�� 

Kreacher began to sob so hard that there were no more coherent words. Tears flowed down 
Hermione��s cheeks as she watched Kreacher, but she did not dare touch him again. Even Ron, who 
was no fan of Kreacher��s, looked troubled. Harry sat back on his heels and shook his head, trying 
to clear it. 

��I don��t understand you, Kreacher,�� he said finally. ��Voldemort tried to kill you, Regulus died 
to bring Voldemort down, but you were still happy to betray Sirius to Voldemort? You were happy 
to go to Narcissa and Bellatrix, and pass information to Voldemort through them ...�� 

��Harry, Kreacher doesn��t think like that,�� said Hermione, wiping her eyes on the back of her 
hand. ��He��s a slave; house-elves are used to bad, even brutal treatment; what Voldemort did to 
Kreacher wasn��t that far out of the common way. What do wizard wars mean to an elf like 
Kreacher? He��s loyal to people who are kind to him, and Mrs. Black must have been, and Regulus 
certainly was, so he served them willingly and parroted their beliefs. I know what you��re going to 
say,�� she went on as Harry began to protest, ��that Regulus changed his mind ... but he doesn��t 
seem to have explained that to Kreacher, does he? And I think I know why. Kreacher and 
Regulus��s family were all safest if they kept to the old pure-blood line. Regulus was trying to 
protect them all.��

 ��Sirius �C �� 

��Sirius was horrible to Kreacher, Harry, and it��s no good looking like that, you know it��s true. 
Kreacher had been alone for such a long time when Sirius came to live here, and he was probably 
starving for a bit of affection. I��m sure ��Miss Cissy�� and ��Miss Bella�� were perfectly lovely to 
Kreacher when he turned up, so he did them a favor and told them everything they wanted to 
know. I��ve said all along that wizards would pay for how they treat house-elves. Well, Voldemort 
did ... and so did Sirius.��

��142ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry had no retort. As he watched Kreacher sobbing on the floor, he remembered what 
Dumbledore had said to him, mere hours after Sirius��s death, I do not think Sirius ever saw 
Kreacher as a being with feelings as acute as a human��s ... 

 ��Kreacher,�� said Harry after a while, ��when you feel up to it, er ... please sit up.�� 

It was several minutes before Kreacher hiccupped himself into silence. Then he pushed himself 
into a sitting position again, rubbing his knuckles into his eyes like a small child. 

��Kreacher, I am going to ask you to do something,�� said Harry. He glanced at Hermione for 
assistance. He wanted to give the order kindly, but at the same time, he could not pretend that it 
was not an order. However, the change in his tone seemed to have gained her approval. She smiled 
encouragingly. 

��Kreacher, I want you, please, to go and find Mundungus Fletcher. We need to find out where 
the locket �C where Master Regulus��s locket is. It��s really important. We want to finish the work 
Master Regulus started, we want to �C er �C ensure that he didn��t die in vain.��

 Kreacher dropped his fists and looked up at Harry.

 ��Find Mundungus Fletcher?�� he croaked. 

��And bring him here, to Grimmauld Place,�� said Harry. ��Do you think you could do that for 
us?�� 

As Kreacher nodded and got to his feet, Harry had a sudden inspiration. He pulled out Hagrid��s 
purse and took out the fake Horcrux, the substitute locket in which Regulus had placed the note to 
Voldemort. 

��Kreacher, I��d, er, like you to have this,�� he said, pressing the locket into the elf��s hand. ��This 
belonged to Regulus and I��m sure he��d want you to have it as a token of gratitude for what you -�� 

��Overkill, mate,�� said Ron as the elf took one look at the locket, let out a howl of shock and 
misery, and threw himself back onto the ground. 

It took them nearly half an hour to calm down Kreacher, who was so overcome to be presented 
with a Black family heirloom for his very own that he was too weak at the knees to stand properly. 
When finally he was able to totter a few steps they all accompanied him to his cupboard, watched 
him tuck up the locket safely in his dirty blankets, and assured him that they would make its 
protection their first priority while he was away. He then made two low bows to Harry and Ron, 
and even gave a funny little spasm in Hermione��s direction that might have been an attempt at a

respectful salute, before Disapparating with the usual loud crack.

Chapter Eleven 
The Bribe 


If Kreacher could escape a lake full of Inferi, 


Harry was 
confident that the capture of Mundungus would take 

a few hours at 
most, and he prowled the house all morning in a 

state of high 

anticipation. However, Kreacher did not return that morning or even that afternoon. By nightfall, 
Harry felt discouraged and anxious, and a supper composed largely of moldy bread, upon which 
Hermione had tried a variety of unsuccessful Transfigurations, did nothing to help. 

Kreacher did not return the following day, nor the day after that. However, two cloaked men had 
appeared in the square outside number twelve, and they remained there into the night, gazing in the 
direction of the house that they could not see. 

��Death Eaters, for sure,�� said Ron, as he, Harry, and Hermione watched from the drawing room 
windows. ��Reckon they know we��re in here?�� 

��I don��t think so,�� said Hermione, though she looked frightened, ��or they��d have sent Snape in 
after us, wouldn��t they?�� 

��D��you reckon he��s been in here and has his tongue tied by Moody��s curse?�� asked Ron. 

��Yes,�� said Hermione, ��otherwise he��d have been able to tell that lot how to get in, wouldn��t he? 

But they��re probably watching to see whether we turn up. They know that Harry owns the house, 

after all.�� 

��How do they -?�� began Harry. 

��Wizarding wills are examined by the Ministry, remember? They��ll know Sirius left you the 

place.�� 

The presence of the Death Eaters outside increased the ominous mood inside number twelve. 
They had not heard a word from anyone beyond Grimmauld Place since Mr. Weasley��s Patronus, 
and the strain was starting to tell. Restless and irritable, Ron had developed an annoying habit of 
playing with the Deluminator in his pocket. This particularly infuriated Hermione, who was 
whiling away the wait for Kreacher by studying The Tales of Beedle the Bard and did not 
appreciate the way the lights kept flashing on and off. 

��Will you stop it!�� she cried on the third evening of Kreacher��s absence, as all the light was

��145ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sucked from the drawing room yet again. 

��Sorry, sorry!�� said Ron, clicking the Deluminator and restoring the lights. ��I don��t know I��m 
doing it!�� 

��Well, can��t you find something useful to occupy yourself?�� 

��What, like reading kids�� stories?�� 

��Dumbledore left me this book, Ron �C�� 

����and he left me the Deluminator, maybe I��m supposed to use it!�� 

Unable to stand the bickering, Harry slipped out of the room unnoticed by either of them. He 
headed downstairs toward the kitchen, which he kept visiting because he was sure that was where 
Kreacher was most likely to reappear. Halfway down the flight of stairs into the hall, however, he 
heard a tap on the front door, then metallic clicks and the grinding of the chain. 

Every nerve in his body seemed to tauten. He pulled out his wand, moved into the shadows 
beside the decapitated elf heads, and waited. The door opened, He saw a glimpse of the lamplit 
square outside, and a cloaked figure edged into the hall and closed the door behind it. The intruder 
took a step forward, and Moody��s voice asked, ��Severus Snape?�� Then the dust figure rose from 
the end of the hall and rushed him, raising its dead hand. 

��It was not I who killed you, Albus,�� said a quiet voice. 

The jinx broke. The dust-figure exploded again, and it was impossible to make out the 
newcomer through the dense gray cloud it left behind. 

Harry pointed the wand into the middle of it. ��Don��t move!�� 

He had forgotten the portrait of Mrs. Black. At the sound of his yell, the curtains hiding her flew 
open and she began to scream, ��Mudbloods and filth dishonoring my house �C�� 

Ron and Hermione came crashing down the stairs behind Harry, wands pointing, like his, at the 
unknown man now standing with his arms raised in the hall below. 

��Hold your fire, it��s me, Remus!�� 

��Oh, thank goodness,�� said Hermione weakly, pointing her wand at Mrs. Black instead; with a 

bang, the curtains swished shut again and silence fell. Ron too lowered his wand, but Harry did 

not. 

��Show yourself!�� he called back. 

Lupin moved forward into the lamplight, hands still held high in a gesture of surrender.

��146ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I am Remus John Lupin, werewolf, sometimes known as Moony, one of the four creators of the 
Marauder��s Map, married to Nymphadora, usually known as Tonks, and I taught you how to 
produce a Patronus, Harry, which takes the form of a stag.�� 

��Oh, all right,�� said Harry, lowering his wand, ��but I had to check, didn��t I?�� 

��Speaking as your ex-Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I quite agree that you had to 
check. Ron, Hermione, you shouldn��t be so quick to lower your defenses.�� 

They ran down the stairs towards him. Wrapped in a thick black traveling cloak, he looked 
exhausted, but pleased to see them. 

��No sign of Severus, then?�� he asked. 

��No,�� said Harry. ��What��s going on? Is everyone okay?�� 

��Yes,�� said Lupin, ��but we��re all being watched. There are a couple of Death Eaters in the 

square outside �C�� 

��We know �C�� 

��I had to Apparate very precisely onto the top step outside the front door to be sure that they 
would not see me. They can��t know you��re in here or I��m sure they��d have more people out there; 
they��re staking out everywhere that��s got any connection with you, Harry. Let��s go downstairs, 
there��s a lot to tell you, and I want to know what happened after you left the Burrow.�� 

They descended into the kitchen, where Hermione pointed her wand at the grate. A fire sprang 
up instantly. It gave the illusion of coziness to the stark stone walls and glistened off the long 
wooden table. Lupin pulled a few butterbeers from beneath his traveling cloak and they sat down. 

��I��d have been here three days ago but I needed to shake off the Death Eater tailing me,�� said 
Lupin. ��So, you came straight here after the wedding?�� 

��No,�� said Harry, ��only after we ran into a couple of Death Eaters in a caf�� on Tottenham Court 
Road.�� 

Lupin slopped most of his butterbeer down his front. ��What?�� 

They explained what had happened; when they had finished, Lupin looked aghast. 

��But how did they find you so quickly? It��s impossible to track anyone who Apparates, unless 
you grab hold of them as they disappear.�� 

��And it doesn��t seem likely they were just strolling down Tottenham Court Road at the time, 
does it?�� said Harry.

��147ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We wondered,�� said Hermione tentatively, ��whether Harry could still have the Trace on him?�� 

��Impossible,�� said Lupin. Ron looked smug, and Harry felt hugely relieved. ��Apart from 
anything else, they��d know for sure Harry was here if he still had the Trace on him, wouldn��t they? 
But I can��t see how they could have tracked you to Tottenham Court Road, that��s worrying, really 
worrying.�� 

He looked disturbed, but as far as Harry was concerned, that question could wait. 

��Tell us what happened after we left, we haven��t heard a thing since Ron��s dad told us the 
family was safe.�� 

��Well, Kingsley saved us,�� said Lupin. ��Thanks to his warning most of the wedding guests were 
able to Disapparate before they arrived.�� 

��Were they Death Eaters or Ministry people?�� interjected Hermione. 

��A mixture; but to all intents and purposes they��re the same thing now,�� said Lupin. ��There 
were about a dozen of them, but they didn��t know you were there, Harry. Arthur heard a rumor that 
they tried to torture your whereabouts out of Scrimgeour before they killed him; if it��s true, he 
didn��t give you away.�� 

Harry looked at Ron and Hermione; their expressions reflected the mingled shock and gratitude 
he felt. He had never liked Scrimgeour much, but if what Lupin said was true, the man��s final act 
had been to try to protect Harry. 

��The Death Eaters searched the Burrow from top to bottom,�� Lupin went on. ��They found the 
ghoul, but didn��t want to get too close �C and then they interrogated those of us who remained for 
hours. They were trying to get information on you, Harry, but of course nobody apart from the 
Order knew that you had been there. 

��At the same time that they were smashing up the wedding, more Death Eaters were forcing 
their way into every Order-connected house in the country. No deaths,�� he added quickly, 
forestalling the question, ��but they were rough. They burned down Dedalus Diggle��s house, but as 
you know he wasn��t there, and they used the Cruciarus Curse on Tonks��s family. Again, trying to 
find out where you went after you visited them. They��re all right �C shaken, obviously, but 
otherwise okay.�� 

��The Death Eaters got through all those protective charms?�� Harry asked, remembering how 
effective these had been on the night he had crashed in Tonks��s parents�� garden. 

��148ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��What you��ve got to realize, Harry, is that the Death Eaters have got the full might of the 
Ministry on their side now,�� said Lupin. ��They��ve got the power to perform brutal spells without 
fear of identification or arrest. They managed to penetrate every defensive spell we��d cast against 
them, and once inside, they were completely open about why they��d come.�� 

��And are they bothering to give an excuse for torturing Harry��s whereabouts out of people?�� 

asked Hermione, an edge to her voice. 

��Well,�� Lupin said. He hesitated, then pulled out a folded copy of the Daily Prophet. 

��Here,�� he said, pushing it across the table to Harry, ��you��ll know sooner or later anyway. 
That��s their pretext for going after you.�� 

Harry smoothed out the paper. A huge photograph of his own face filled the front page. He read 
the headline over it, 

WANTED FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT 
THE DEATH OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 


Ron and Hermione gave roars of outrage, but Harry said nothing. He pushed the newspaper 
away; he did not want to read anymore, He knew what it would say. Nobody but those who had 
been on top of the tower when Dumbledore died knew who had really killed him and, as Rita 
Skeeter had already told the Wizarding world, Harry had been seen running from the place 
moments after Dumbledore had fallen. 

��I��m sorry, Harry,�� Lupin said. 

��So Death Eaters have taken over the Daily Prophet too?�� asked Hermione furiously. 

Lupin nodded. 

��But surely people realize what��s going on?�� 

��The coup has been smooth and virtually silent,�� said Lupin. 

��The official version of Scrimgeour��s murder is that he resigned; he has been replaced by Pius 
Thicknesse, who is under the Imperius Curse.�� 

��Why didn��t Voldemort declare himself Minister of Magic?�� asked Ron. 

Lupin laughed. 

��He doesn��t need to, Ron. Effectively, he is the Minister, but why should he sit behind a desk at

��149ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the Ministry? His puppet, Thicknesse, is taking care of everyday business, leaving Voldemort free 
to extend his power beyond the Ministry. 

��Naturally many people have deduced what has happened. There has been such a dramatic 
change in Ministry policy in the last few days, and many are whispering that Voldemort must be 
behind it. However, that is the point. They whisper. They daren��t confide in each other, not 
knowing whom to trust; they are scared to speak out, in case their suspicions are true and their 
families are targeted. Yes, Voldemort is playing a very clever game. Declaring himself might have 
provoked open rebellion. Remaining masked has created confusion, uncertainty, and fear.�� 

��And this dramatic change in Ministry policy,�� said Harry, ��involves warning the Wizarding 
world against me instead of Voldemort?�� 

��That��s certainly a part of it,�� said Lupin, ��and it is a masterstroke. Now that Dumbledore is 
dead, you �C the Boy Who Lived �C were sure to be the symbol and rallying point for any resistance 
to Voldemort. But by suggesting that you had a hand in the old hero��s death, Voldemort has not 
only set a price upon your head, but sown doubt and fear amongst many who would have defended 
you. 

��Meanwhile, the Ministry has started moving against Muggle-borns.�� 

Lupin pointed at the Daily Prophet. 

��Look at page two.�� 

Hermione turned the pages with much the same expression of distaste she had when handling 
Secrets of the Darkest Art. 

��Muggle-born Register!�� she read aloud. ����The Ministry of Magic is undertaking a survey of so-
called ��Muggle-borns�� the better to understand how they came to possess magical secrets. 

����Recent research undertaken by the Department of Mysteries reveals that magic can only be 
passed from person to person when Wizards reproduce. Where no proven Wizarding ancestry 
exists, therefore, the so-called Muggle-born is likely to have obtained magical power by theft or 
force. 

����The Ministry is determined to root out such usurpers of magical power, and to this end has 
issued an invitation to every so-called Muggle-born to present themselves for interview by the 
newly appointed Muggle-born Registration Commission.���� 

��People won��t let this happen,�� said Ron. 

��150ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It is happening, Ron,�� said Lupin. ��Muggle-borns are being rounded up as we speak.�� 

��But how are they supposed to have 'stolen' magic?�� said Ron. ��It��s mental, if you could steal 
magic there wouldn��t be any Squibs, would there?�� 

��I know,�� said Lupin. ��Nevertheless, unless you can prove that you have at least one close 
Wizarding relative, you are now deemed to have obtained your magical power illegally and must 
suffer the punishment.�� 

Ron glanced at Hermione, then said, ��What if purebloods and halfbloods swear a Muggle-born��s 
part of their family? I��ll tell everyone Hermione��s my cousin �C�� 

Hermione covered Ron��s hand with hers and squeezed it. ��Thank you, Ron, but I couldn��t let 
you �C�� 

��You won��t have a choice,�� said Ron fiercely, gripping her hand back. ��I��ll teach you my family 
tree so you can answer questions on it.�� 

Hermione gave a shaky laugh. 

��Ron, as we��re on the run with Harry Potter, the most wanted person in the country, I don��t 
think it matters. If I was going back to school it would be different. What��s Voldemort planning for 
Hogwarts?�� she asked Lupin. 

��Attendance is now compulsory for every young witch and wizard,�� he replied. ��That was 
announced yesterday. It��s a change, because it was never obligatory before. Of course, nearly 
every witch and wizard in Britain has been educated at Hogwarts, but their parents had the right to 
teach them at home or send them abroad if they preferred. This way, Voldemort will have the 
whole Wizarding population under his eye from a young age. And it��s also another way of 
weeding out Muggle-borns, because students must be given Blood Status �C meaning that they have 
proven to the Ministry that they are of Wizard descent �C before they are allowed to attend.�� 

Harry felt sickened and angry. At this moment, excited eleven-year-olds would be poring over 
stacks of newly purchased spell-books, unaware that they would never see Hogwarts, perhaps 
never see their families again either. 

��It��s ... it��s ...�� he muttered, struggling to find words that did justice to the horror of his thoughts, 

but Lupin said quietly, ��I know.�� 

Lupin hesitated. 

��I��ll understand if you can��t confirm this, Harry, but the Order is under the impression that

��151ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Dumbledore left you a mission.�� 

��He did,�� Harry replied, ��and Ron and Hermione are in on it and they��re coming with me.�� 

��Can you confide in me what the mission is?�� 

Harry looked into the prematurely lined face, framed in thick but graying hair, and wished that 

he could return a different answer. 

��I can��t, Remus, I��m sorry. If Dumbledore didn��t tell you I don��t think I can.�� 

��I thought you��d say that,�� said Lupin, looking disappointed. ��But I might still be of some use to 
you. You know what I am and what I can do. I could come with you to provide protection. There 
would be no need to tell me exactly what you were up to.�� 

Harry hesitated. It was a very tempting offer, though how they would be able to keep their 
mission secret from Lupin if he were with them all the time he could not imagine. 

Hermione, however, looked puzzled. ��But what about Tonks?�� she asked. 

��What about her?�� said Lupin. 

��Well,�� said Hermione, frowning, ��you��re married! How does she feel about you going away 

with us?�� 

��Tonks will be perfectly safe,�� said Lupin, ��She��ll be at her parents�� house.�� 

There was something strange in Lupin��s tone, it was almost cold. There was also something odd 

in the idea of Tonks remaining hidden at her parents�� house; she was, after all, a member of the 

Order and, as far as Harry knew, was likely to want to be in the thick of the action. 

��Remus,�� said Hermione tentatively, ��is everything all right ... you know ... between you and �C �� 

��Everything is fine, thank you,�� said Lupin pointedly. 

Hermione turned pink. There was another pause, an awkward and embarrassed one, and then 

Lupin said, with an air of forcing himself to admit something unpleasant, ��Tonks is going to have a 

baby.�� 

��Oh, how wonderful!�� squealed Hermione. 

��Excellent!�� said Ron enthusiastically. 

��Congratulations,�� said Harry. 

Lupin gave an artificial smile that was more like a grimace, then said, ��So ... do you accept my 
offer? Will three become four? I cannot believe that Dumbledore would have disapproved, he 
appointed me your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, after all. And I must tell you that I

��152ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

believe we are facing magic many of us have never encountered or imagined.�� 

Ron and Hermione both looked at Harry. 

��Just �C just to be clear,�� he said. ��You want to leave Tonks at her parents�� house and come away 
with us?�� 

��She��ll be perfectly safe there, they��ll look after her,�� said Lupin. He spoke with a finality 
bordering on indifference, ��Harry, I��m sure James would have wanted me to stick with you.�� 

��Well,�� said Harry slowly, ��I��m not. I��m pretty sure my father would have wanted to know why 
you aren��t sticking with your own kid, actually.�� 

Lupin��s face drained of color. The temperature in the kitchen might have dropped ten degrees. 
Ron stared around the room as though he had been bidden to memorize it, while Hermione��s eyes 
swiveled backward and forward from Harry to Lupin. 

��You don��t understand,�� said Lupin at last. 

��Explain, then,�� said Harry. 

Lupin swallowed. 

��I �C I made a grave mistake in marrying Tonks. I did it against my better judgment and have 
regretted it very much every since.�� 

��I see,�� said Harry, ��so you��re just going to dump her and the kid and run off with us?�� 

Lupin sprang to his feet, His chair toppled over backward, and he glared at them so fiercely that 
Harry saw, for the first time ever, the shadow of the wolf upon his human face. 

��Don��t you understand what I��ve done to my wife and my unborn child? I should never have 
married her. I��ve made her an outcast!�� 

Lupin kicked aside the chair he had overturned. 

��You have only ever seen me amongst the Order, or under Dumbledore��s protection at 
Hogwarts! You don��t know how most of the Wizarding world sees creatures like me! When they 
know of my affliction, they can barely talk to me! Don��t you see what I��ve done? 

��Even her own family is disgusted by our marriage, what parents want their only daughter to 
marry a werewolf? And the child �C the child �C �� 

Lupin actually seized handfuls of his own hair; he looked quite deranged. 

��My kind don��t usually breed! It will be like me, I am convinced of it �C how can I forgive 

myself, when I knowingly risked passing on my own condition to an innocent child? And if, by

��153ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

some miracle, it is not like me, then it will be better off, a hundred times so, without a father of 
whom it must always be ashamed!�� 

��Remus!�� whispered Hermione, tears in her eyes. ��Don��t say that �C how could any child be 
ashamed of you?�� 

��Oh, I don��t know, Hermione,�� said Harry. ��I��d be pretty ashamed of him.�� 

Harry did not know where his rage was coming from, but it had propelled him to his feet too. 

Lupin looked as though Harry had hit him. 

��If the new regime thinks Muggle-borns are bad,�� Harry said, ��what will they do to a half-
werewolf whose father��s in the Order? My father died trying to protect my mother and me, and 
you reckon he��d tell you to abandon your kid to go on an adventure with us?�� 

��How �C how dare you?�� said Lupin. ��This is not about a desire for �C for danger or personal 
glory �C how dare you suggest such a �C�� 

��I think you��re feeling a bit of a daredevilͦ������ ,�� Harry said, ��You fancy stepping into 
Sirius��s shoes �C�� 

��Harry, no!�� Hermione begged him, but he continued to glare into Lupin��s livid face. 

��I��d never have believed this,�� Harry said. ��The man who taught me to fight dementors �C a 

coward.�� 

Lupin drew his wand so fast that Harry had barely reached for his own; there was a loud bang 
and he felt himself flying backward as if punched; as he slammed into the kitchen wall and slid to 
the floor, he glimpsed the tail of Lupin��s cloak disappearing around the door. 

��Remus, Remus, come back!�� Hermione cried, but Lupin did not respond. A moment later they 

heard the front door slam. 

��Harry!�� wailed Hermione. ��How could you?�� 

��It was easy,�� said Harry. He stood up, he could feel a lump swelling where his head had hit the 

wall. He was still so full of anger he was shaking. 

��Don��t look at me like that!�� he snapped at Hermione. 

��Don��t you start on her!�� snarled Ron. 

��No �C no �C we mustn��t fight!�� said Hermione, launching herself between them. 

��You shouldn��t have said that stuff to Lupin,�� Ron told Harry. 

��He had it coming to him,�� said Harry. Broken images were racing each other through his mind,

��154ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Sirius falling through the veil; Dumbledore suspended, broken, in midair; a flash of green light and 

his mother��s voice, begging for mercy ... 

��Parents,�� said Harry, ��shouldn��t leave their kids unless �C unless they��ve got to.�� 

��Harry �C�� said Hermione, stretching out a consoling hand, but he shrugged it off and walked 
away, his eyes on the fire Hermione had conjured. He had once spoken to Lupin out of that 
fireplace, seeking reassurance about James, and Lupin had consoled him. Now Lupin��s tortured 
white face seemed to swim in the air before him. He felt a sickening surge of remorse. Neither Ron 
nor Hermione spoke, but Harry felt sure that they were looking at each other behind his back, 
communicating silently. 

He turned around and caught them turning hurriedly away form each other. 

��I know I shouldn��t have called him a coward.�� 

��No, you shouldn��t,�� said Ron at once. 

��But he��s acting like one.�� 

��All the same ...�� said Hermione. 

��I know,�� said Harry. ��But if it makes him go back to Tonks, it��ll be worth it, won��t it?�� 

He could not keep the plea out of his voice. Hermione looked sympathetic, Ron uncertain. Harry 
looked down at his feet, thinking of his father. Would James have backed Harry in what he had 
said to Lupin, or would he have been angry at how his son had treated his old friend? 

The silent kitchen seemed to hum with the shock of the recent scene and with Ron and 
Hermione��s unspoken reproaches. The Daily Prophet Lupin had brought was still lying on the 
table, Harry��s own face staring up at the ceiling from the front page. He walked over to it and sat 
down, opened the paper at random, and pretended to read. He could not take in the words; his mind 
was still too full of the encounter with Lupin. He was sure that Ron and Hermione had resumed 
their silent communications on the other side of the Prophet. He turned a page loudly, and 
Dumbledore��s name leapt out at him. It was a moment or two before he took in the meaning of the 
photograph, which showed a family group. Beneath the photograph were the words, The 
Dumbledore family, left to right, Albus; Percival, holding newborn Ariana; Kendra, and 
Aberforth. 

His attention caught, Harry examined the picture more carefully. Dumbledore��s father, Percival, 
was a good-looking man with eyes that seemed to twinkle even in this faded old photograph. The

��155ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

baby, Ariana, was a little longer than a loaf of bread and no more distinctive-looking. The mother, 
Kendra, had jet black hair pulled into a high bun. Her face had a carved quality about it. Harry 
thought of photos of Native Americans he��d seen as he studied her dark eyes, high cheekbones, 
and straight nose, formally composed above a high-necked silk gown. Albus and Aberforth wore 
matching lacy collared jackets and had identical, shoulder-length hairstyles. Albus looked several 
years older, but otherwise the two boys looked very alike, for this was before Albus��s nose had 
been broken and before he started wearing glasses. 

The family looked quite happy and normal, smiling serenely up out of the newspaper. Baby 
Ariana��s arm waved vaguely out of her shawl. Harry looked above the picture and saw the 
headline, 

EXCLUSIVE EXTRACT FROM UPCOMING 
BIOGRAPHY OF ALBUS DUMBLEDORE 
by Rita Skeeter 

Thinking it could hardly make him feel any worse than he already did, Harry began to read, 

Proud and haughty, Kendra Dumbledore could not bear to remain in Mould-on-the-Wold 
after her husband Percival��s well-publicized arrest and imprisonment in Azkaban. She 
therefore decided to uproot the family and relocate to Godric��s Hollow, the village that was 
later to gain fame as the scene of Harry Potter��s strange escape from You-Know-Who. 

Like Mould-on-the-Wold, Godric��s Hollow was home to a number of Wizarding families, 
but as Kendra knew none of them, she would be spared the curiosity about her husband��s crime 
she had faced in her former village. By repeatedly rebuffing the friendly advances of her new 
Wizarding neighbors, she soon ensured that her family was left well alone. 

��Slammed the door in my face when I went around to welcome her with a batch of 
homemade Cauldron Cakes,�� says Bathilda Bagshot. ��The first year they were there I only ever 
saw the two boys. Wouldn��t have known there was a daughter if I hadn��t been picking 
Plangentines by moonlight the winter after they moved in, and saw Kendra leading Ariana out 
into the back garden. Walked her round the lawn once, keeping a firm grip on her, then took 
her back inside. Didn��t know what to make of it.��

��156ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

It seems that Kendra thought the move to Godric��s Hollow was the perfect opportunity to 
hide Ariana once and for all, something she had probably been planning for years. The timing 
was significant. Ariana was barely seven years old when she vanished from sight, and seven is 
the age by which most experts agree that magic will have revealed itself, if present. Nobody 
now alive remembers Ariana ever demonstrating even the slightest sign of magical ability. It 
seems clear, therefore, that Kendra made a decision to hide her daughter��s existence rather than 
suffer the shame of admitting that she had produced a Squib. Moving away from the friends 
and neighbors who knew Ariana would, of course, make imprisoning her all the easier. The 
tiny number of people who henceforth knew of Ariana��s existence could be counted upon to 
keep the secret, including her two brothers, who had deflected awkward questions with the 
answer their mother had taught them. ��My sister is too frail for school.��

 Next week, Albus Dumbledore at Hogwarts �C the Prizes and the Pretense. 

Harry had been wrong. What he had read had indeed made him feel worse. He looked back at 
the photograph of the apparently happy family. Was it true? How could he find out? He wanted to 
go to Godric��s Hollow, even if Bathilda was in no fit state to talk to him, he wanted to visit the 
place where he and Dumbledore had both lost loved ones. He was in the process of lowering the 
newspaper, to ask Ron��s and Hermione��s opinions, when a deafening crack echoed around the 
kitchen. 

For the first time in three days Harry had forgotten all about Kreacher. His immediate thought 
was that Lupin had burst back into the room, and for a split second, he did not take in the mass of 
struggling limbs that had appeared out of thin air right beside his chair. He hurried to his feet as 
Kreacher disentangled himself and, bowing low to Harry, croaked, ��Kreacher has returned with the 
thief Mundungus Fletcher, Master.��

 Mundungus scrambled up and pulled out his wand; Hermione, however, was too quick for him. 
��Expelliarmus!�� 
Mundungus��s wand soared into the air, and Hermione caught it. Wild-eyed, Mundungus dived 


for the stairs. Ron rugby-tackled (bring down (as in football) him and Mundungus hit the stone 
floor with a muffled crunch. 
��What?�� he bellowed, writhing in his attempts to free himself from Ron��s grip. ��Wha��ve I 
done? Setting a bleedin�� house-elf on me, what are you playing at, wha��ve I done, lemme go,

��157ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

lemme go, or �C�� 

��You��re not in much of a position to make threats,�� said Harry. He threw aside the newspaper, 
crossed the kitchen in a few strides, and dropped to his knees beside Mundungus, who stopped 
struggling and looked terrified. Ron got up, panting, and watched as Harry pointed his wand 
deliberately at Mundungus��s nose. Mundungus stank of stale sweat and tobacco smoke. His hair 
was matted and his robes stained. 

��Kreacher apologizes for the delay in bringing the thief, Master,�� croaked the elf. ��Fletcher 
knows how to avoid capture, has many hidey-holes and accomplices. Nevertheless, Kreacher 
cornered the thief in the end.��

 ��You��ve done really well, Kreacher,�� said Harry, and the elf bowed low. 

 ��Right, we��ve got a few questions for you,�� Harry told Mundungus, who shouted at once. 

��I panicked, okay? I never wanted to come along, no offense, mate, but I never volunteered to 
die for you, an�� that was bleedin�� You-Know-Who come flying at me, anyone woulda got outta 

there. I said all along I didn��t wanna do it �C��

 ��For your information, none of the rest of us Disapparated,�� said Hermione. 

��Well, you��re a bunch of bleedin' 'eroes then, aren��t you, but I never pretended I was up for 

killing meself �C�� 

��We��re not interested in why you ran out on Mad-Eye,�� said Harry, moving his wand a little 
closer to Mundungus��s baggy, bloodshot eyes. ��We already knew you were an unreliable bit of 
scum.�� 

��Well then, why the 'ell am I being 'unted down by 'ouse-elves? Or is this about them goblets 
again? I ain��t got none of 'em left, or you could 'ave 'em �C�� 

��It��s not about the goblets either, although you��re getting warmer,�� said Harry. ��Shut up and 
listen.�� 

It felt wonderful to have something to do, someone of whom he could demand some small 
portion of truth. Harry��s wand was now so close to the bridge of Mundungus��s nose that 
Mundungus had gone cross-eyed trying to keep it in view. 

��When you cleaned out this house of anything valuable,�� Harry began, but Mundungus 
interrupted him again.

 ��Sirius never cared about any of the junk �C��

��158ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

There was the sound of pattering (sound of footsteps) feet, a blaze of shining copper, an 
echoing clang, and a shriek of agony; Kreacher had taken a run at Mundungus and hit him over the 
head with a saucepan. 

��Call 'im off, call 'im off, 'e should be locked up!�� screamed Mundungus, cowering as Kreacher 

raised the heavy-bottomed pan again.

 ��Kreacher, no!�� shouted Harry.

 Kreacher��s thin arms trembled with the weight of the pan, still held aloft.

 ��Perhaps just one more, Master Harry, for luck?��

 Ron laughed. 

��We need him conscious, Kreacher, but if he needs persuading, you can do the honors,�� said 
Harry. 

��Thank you very much, Master,�� said Kreacher with a bow, and he retreated a short distance, 
his great pale eyes still fixed upon Mundungus with loathing. 

��When you stripped this house of all the valuables you could find,�� Harry began again, ��you 
took a bunch of stuff from the kitchen cupboard. There was a locket there.�� Harry��s mouth was 
suddenly dry. He could sense Ron and Hermione��s tension and excitement too. ��What did you do 
with it?��

 ��Why?�� asked Mundungus. ��Is it valuable?��

 ��You��ve still got it!�� cried Hermione. 

��No, he hasn��t,�� said Ron shrewdly. ��He��s wondering whether he should have asked more 
money for it.�� 

��More?�� said Mundungus. ��That wouldn��t have been effing (Slang) damned difficult ... 

bleedin�� gave it away, di��n�� I? No choice.��

 ��What do you mean?�� 

��I was selling in Diagon Alley and she come up to me and asks if I��ve got a license for trading 

in magical artifacts. Bleedin�� snoop. She was gonna fine me, but she took a fancy to the locket an�� 

told me she��d take it and let me off that time, and to fink (inform) meself lucky.��

 ��Who was this woman?�� asked Harry. 

��I dunno, some Ministry hag.�� Mundungus considered for a moment, brow wrinkled. ��Little 

woman. Bow on top of 'er head.��

��159ҳ��

He frowned and then added, ��Looked like a toad.�� 

Harry dropped his wand, It hit Mundungus on the nose and shot red sparks into his eyebrows, 
which ignited. 

��Aquamenti!�� screamed Hermione, and a jet of water streamed from her wand, engulfing a 
spluttering and choking Mundungus. 

Harry looked up and saw his own shock reflected in Ron��s and Hermione��s faces. The scars on 
the back of his right hand seemed to be tingling again.

Chapter Twelve 

Magic is Might 

As August wore on, the square of unkempt grass in the 


middle of 
Grimmauld Place shriveled in the sun until it was brittle 

and brown. 
The inhabitants of number twelve were never seen by 

anyone in 
the surrounding houses, and nor was number twelve itself. 

The 
muggles who lived in Grimmauld Place had long since 

accepted 
the amusing mistake in the numbering that had caused number eleven to sit beside number 
thirteen. 

And yet the square was now attracting a trickle of visitors who seemed to find the anomaly 
most intriguing. Barely a day passed without one or two people arriving in Grimmauld Place with 
no other purpose, or so it seemed, than to lean against the railings facing numbers eleven and 
thirteen, watching the join between the two houses. The lurkers were never the same two days 
running, although they all seemed to share a dislike for normal clothing. Most of the Londoners 
who passed them were used to eccentric dressers and took little notice, though occasionally one of 
them might glance back, wondering why anyone would wear cloaks in this heat. 

The watchers seemed to be gleaning little satisfaction from their vigil. Occasionally one of 
them started forward excitedly, as if they had seen something interesting at last, only to fall back 
looking disappointed. 

On the first day of September there were more people lurking in the square than ever before. 
Half a dozen men in long cloaks stood silent and watchful, gazing as ever at houses eleven and 
thirteen, but the thing for which they were waiting still appeared elusive. As evening drew in, 
bringing with it an unexpected gust of chilly rain for the first time in weeks, there occurred one of 
those inexplicable moments when they appeared to have seen something interesting. The man with 
the twisted face pointed and his closest companion, a podgy, pallid man, started forward, but a 
moment later they had relaxed into their previous state of inactivity, looking frustrated and 
disappointed. 

Meanwhile, inside number twelve, Harry had just entered the hall. He had nearly lost his

��161ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

balance as he Apparated onto the top step just outside the front door, and thought that the Death 
Eaters might have caught a glimpse of his momentarily exposed elbow. Shutting the front door 
carefully behind him, he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, draped it over his arm, and hurried along 
the gloomy hallway toward the door that led to the basement, a stolen copy of the Daily Prophet 
clutched in his hand. 

The usual low whisper of ��Severus Snape�� greeted him, the chill wind swept him, and his 
tongue rolled up for a moment. 

��I didn��t kill you,�� he said, once it had unrolled, then held his breath as the dusty jinx-figure 
exploded. He waited until he was halfway down the stairs to the kitchen, out of earshot of Mrs. 
Black and clear of the dust cloud, before calling, ��I��ve got news, and you won��t like it.�� 

The kitchen was almost unrecognizable. Every surface now shone; Copper pots and pans had 
been burnished (polish) to a rosy glow; the wooden tabletop gleamed; the goblets and plates 
already laid for dinner glinted in the light from a merrily blazing fire, on which a cauldron was 
simmering. Nothing in the room, however, was more dramatically different than the house-elf who 
now came hurrying toward Harry, dressed in a snowy-white towel, his ear hair as clean and fluffy 
as cotton woolԭ��, Regulus��s locket bouncing on his thin chest. 

��Shoes off, if you please, Master Harry, and hands washed before dinner,�� croaked Kreacher, 
seizing the Invisibility Cloak and slouching off to hang it on a hook on the wall, beside a number 
of old-fashioned robes that had been freshly laundered. 

��What��s happened?�� Ron asked apprehensively. He and Hermione had been poring over a sheaf 
of scribbled notes and hand drawn maps that littered the end of the long kitchen table, but now 
they watched Harry as he strode toward them and threw down the newspaper on top of their 
scattered parchment. 

A large picture of a familiar, hook-nosed, black-haired man stared up at them all, beneath a 
headline that read, 

SEVERUS SNAPE CONFIRMED AS HOGWARTS HEADMASTER 

��No!�� said Ron and Hermione loudly. 

Hermione was quickest; she snatched up the newspaper and began to read the accompanying 
story out loud. 

��162ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Severus Snape, long-standing Potions master at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and wizardry, 
was today appointed headmaster in the most important of several staffing changes at the ancient 
school. Following the resignation of the previous Muggle Studies teacher, Alecto Carrow will take 
over the post while her brother, Amycus, fills the position of Defense Against the Dark Arts 
professor.�� 

����I welcome the opportunity to uphold our finest Wizarding traditions and values �C ��Like 
committing murder and cutting off people��s ears, I suppose! Snape, headmaster! Snape in 
Dumbledore��s study �C Merlin��s pants!�� she shrieked, making both Harry and Ron jump. She leapt 
up from the table and hurtled from the room, shouting as she went, ��I��ll be back in a minute!�� 

����Merlin��s pants��?�� repeated Ron, looking amused. ��She must be upset.�� He pulled the 
newspaper toward him and perused the article about Snape. 

��The other teachers won��t stand for this, McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout all know the 
truth, they know how Dumbledore died. They won��t accept Snape as headmaster. And who are 
these Carrows?�� 

��Death Eaters,�� said Harry. ��There are pictures of them inside. They were at the top of the 
tower when Snape killed Dumbledore, so it��s all friends together. And,�� Harry went on bitterly, 
drawing up a chair, ��I can��t see that the other teachers have got any choice but to stay. If the 
Ministry and Voldemort are behind Snape it��ll be a choice between staying and teaching, or a nice 
few years in Azkaban �C and that��s if they��re lucky. I reckon they��ll stay to try and protect the 
students.�� 

Kreacher came bustling to the table with a large tureen in his hands, and ladled out soup into 
pristine bowls, whistling between his teeth as he did so. 

��Thanks, Kreacher,�� said Harry, flipping over the Prophet so as not to have to look at Snape��s 
face. ��Well, at least we know exactly where Snape is now.�� 

He began to spoon soup into his mouth. The quality of Kreacher��s cooking had improved 
dramatically ever since he had been given Regulus��s locket. Today��s French onion was as good as 
Harry had ever tasted. 

��There are still a load of Death Eaters watching this house,�� he told Ron as he ate, ��more than 
usual. It��s like they��re hoping we��ll march out carrying our school trunks and head off for the 
Hogwarts Express.��

��163ҳ�� 
542ҳ

Ron glanced at his watch. 

��I��ve been thinking about that all day. It left nearly six hours ago. Weird, not being on it, isn��t 
it?�� 

In his mind��s eye Harry seemed to see the scarlet steam engine as he and Ron had once 
followed it by air, shimmering between fields and hills, a rippling scarlet caterpillar. He was sure 
Ginny, Neville, and Luna were sitting together at this moment, perhaps wondering where he, Ron, 
and Hermione were, or debating how best to undermine Snape��s new regime.

 ��They nearly saw me coming back in just now,�� Harry said, ��I landed badly on the top step, and 
the Cloak slipped.�� 

��I do that every time. Oh, here she is,�� Ron added, craning around in his seat to watch 
Hermione reentering the kitchen. ��And what in the name of Merlin��s most baggy Y Fronts was that 
about?��

 ��I remembered this,�� Hermione panted. 

She was carrying a large, framed picture, which she now lowered to the floor before seizing her 
small, beaded bag from the kitchen sideboard. Opening it, she proceeded to force the painting 
inside and despite the fact that it was patently too large to fit inside the tiny bag, within a few 
seconds it had vanished, like so much ease, into the bag��s capacious depths. 

��Phineas Nigellus,�� Hermione explained as she threw the bag onto the kitchen table with the 
usual sonorous, clanking crash. 

��Sorry?�� said Ron, but Harry understood. The painted image of Phineas Nigellus Black was 
able to travel between his portrait in Grimmauld Place and the one that hung in the headmaster��s 
office at Hogwarts, the circular tower-top room where Snape was no doubt sitting right now, in 
triumphant possession of Dumbledore��s collection of delicate, silver magical instruments, the stone 
Pensieve, the Sorting Hat and, unless it had been moved elsewhere, the sword of Gryffindor. 

��Snape could send Phineas Nigellus to look inside this house for him,�� Hermione explained to 
Ron as she resumed her seat. ��But let him try it now, all Phineas Nigellus will be able to see is the 
inside of my handbag.��

 ��Good thinking!�� said Ron, looking impressed. 

��Thank you,�� smiled Hermione, pulling her soup toward her. ��So, Harry, what else happened 
today?��

��164ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Nothing,�� said Harry. ��Watched the Ministry entrance for seven hours. No sign of her. Saw 
your dad though, Ron. He looks fine.�� 

Ron nodded his appreciation of this news. They had agreed that it was far too dangerous to try 
and communicate with Mr. Weasley while he walked in and out of the Ministry, because he was 
always surrounded by other Ministry workers. It was, however, reassuring to catch these glimpses 
of him, even if he did look very strained and anxious. 

��Dad always told us most Ministry people use the Floo Network to get to work,�� Ron said. 
��That��s why we haven��t seen Umbridge, she��d never walk, she��d think she��s too important.�� 

��And what about that funny old witch and that little wizard in the navy robes?�� Hermione 
asked. 

 ��Oh yeah, the bloke from Magical Maintenance,�� said Ron. 

��How do you know he works for Magical Maintenance?�� Hermione asked, her soupspoon 

suspended in midair.

 ��Dad said everyone from Magical Maintenance wears navy blue robes.��

 ��But you never told us that!�� 

Hermione dropped her spoon and pulled toward her the sheaf of notes and maps that she and 
Ron had been examining when Harry had entered the kitchen. 

��There��s nothing in here about navy blue robes, nothing!�� she said, flipping feverishly through 
the pages. 

 ��Well, does it really matter?�� 

��Ron, it all matters! If we��re going to get into the Ministry and not give ourselves away when 
they��re bound to be on the lookout for intruders, every little detail matters! We��ve been over and 
over this, I mean, what��s the point of all these reconnaissance trips if you aren��t even bothering to 
tell us �C��

 ��Blimey, Hermione, I forget one little thing �C �� 

��You do realize, don��t you, that there��s probably no more dangerous place in the whole world 
for us to be right now than the Ministry of �C��

 ��I think we should do it tomorrow,�� said Harry.

 Hermione stopped dead, her jaw hanging; Ron choked a little over his soup. 

 ��Tomorrow?�� repeated Hermione. ��You aren��t serious, Harry?��

��165ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I am,�� said Harry. ��I don��t think we��re going to be much better prepared than we are now even 
if we skulk around the Ministry entrance for another month. The longer we put it off, the farther 
away that locket could be. There��s already a good chance Umbridge has chucked it away; the thing 
doesn��t open.��

 ��Unless,�� said Ron, ��she��s found a way of opening it and she��s now possessed.��

 ��Wouldn��t make any difference to her, she was so evil in the first place,�� Harry shrugged. 

 Hermione was biting her lip, deep in thought. 

��We know everything important,�� Harry went on, addressing Hermione. ��We know they��ve 
stopped Apparition in and out of the Ministry. We know only the most senior Ministry members 
are allowed to connect their homes to the Floo Network now, because Ron heard those two 
Unspeakables complaining about it. And we know roughly where Umbridge��s office is, because of 
what you heard the bearded bloke saying to his mate �C��

 ����I��ll be up on level one, Dolores wants to see me,���� Hermione recited immediately. 

��Exactly,�� said Harry. ��And we know you get in using those funny coins, or tokens, or 
whatever they are, because I saw that witch borrowing one from her friend �C ��

 ��But we haven��t got any!��

 ��If the plan works, we will have,�� Harry continued calmly. 

��I don��t know, Harry, I don��t know ... There are an awful lot of things that could go wrong, so 
much relies on chance ...�� 

��That��ll be true even if we spend another three months preparing,�� said Harry. ��It��s time to 
act.�� 

He could tell from Ron��s and Hermione��s faces that they were scared; he was not particularly 
confident himself, and yet he was sure the time had come to put their plan into operation. 

They had spent the previous four weeks taking it in turns to don the Invisibility Cloak and spy 
on the official entrance to the Ministry, which Ron, thanks to Mr. Weasley, had known since 
childhood. They had tailed Ministry workers on their way in, eavesdropped on their conversations, 
and learned by careful observation which of them could be relied upon to appear, alone, at the 
same time every day. Occasionally there had been a chance to sneak a Daily Prophet out of 
somebody��s briefcase. Slowly they had built up the sketchy maps and notes now stacked in front of 
Hermione.

��166ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��All right,�� said Ron slowly, ��let��s say we go for it tomorrow ... I think it should just be me and 

Harry.��

 ��Oh, don��t start that again!�� sighed Hermione. ��I thought we��d settled this.�� 

��It��s one thing hanging around the entrances under the Cloak, but this is different. Hermione,�� 
Ron jabbed a finger at a copy of the Daily Prophet dated ten days previously. ��You��re on the list 
of Muggle-borns who didn��t present themselves for interrogation!�� 

��And you��re supposed to be dying of spattergroit at the Burrow! If anyone shouldn��t go, it��s 
Harry, he��s got a ten-thousand-Galleon price on his head �C��

 ��Fine, I��ll stay here,�� said Harry. ��Let me know if you ever defeat Voldemort, won��t you?�� 

As Ron and Hermione laughed, pain shot through the scar on Harry��s forehead. His hand 
jumped to it. He saw Hermione��s eyes narrow, and he tried to pass off the movement by brushing 
his hair out of his eyes. 

��Well, if all three of us go, we��ll have to Disapparate separately,�� Ron was saying. ��We can��t 
all fit under the Cloak anymore.�� 

Harry��s scar was becoming more and more painful. He stood up. At once, Kreacher hurried 
forward. 

��Master has not finished his soup, would master prefer the savory stew, or else the treacle tart 
to which Master is so partial?��

 ��Thanks, Kreacher, but I��ll be back in a minute �C er �C bathroom.�� 

Aware that Hermione was watching him suspiciously, Harry hurried up the stairs to the hall and 
then to the first landing, where he dashed into the bathroom and bolted the door again. Grunting 
with pain, he slumped over the black basin with its taps in the form of open-mouthed serpents and 
closed his eyes ... . 

He was gliding along a twilit street. The buildings on either side of him had high, timbered 
gables; they looked like gingerbread houses. He approached one of them, then saw the whiteness 
of his own long-fingered hand against the door. He knocked. He felt a mounting excitement ... 

The door opened. A laughing woman stood there. Her face fell as she looked into Harry��s face, 

humor gone, terror replacing it.

 ��Gregorovitch?�� said a high, cold voice. 

She shook her head. She was trying to close the door. A white hand held it steady, prevented

��167ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

her shutting him out ... 

 ��I want Gregorovitch.�� 

��Er wohnt hier nicht mehr!�� she cried, shaking her head. ��He no live here! He no live here! I 
know him not!�� 

Abandoning the attempt to close the door, she began to back away down the dark hall, and 
Harry followed, gliding toward her, and his long-fingered hand had drawn his wand. 

 ��Where is he?��

 ��Das weiff ich nicht! He move! I know not, I know not!�� 

He raised his hand. She screamed. Two young children came running into the hall. She tried to 

shield them with her arms. There was a flash of green light �C 

 ��Harry! HARRY!��

 He opened his eyes; he had sunk to the floor. Hermione was pounding on the door again.

 ��Harry, open up!�� 

He had shouted out, he knew it. He got up and unbolted the door; Hermione toppled inside at 

once, regained her balance, and looked around suspiciously. Ron was right behind her, looking 

unnerved as he pointed his wand into the corners of the chilly bathroom.

 ��What were you doing?�� asked Hermione sternly.

 ��What d��you think I was doing?�� asked Harry with feeble bravado��������. 

 ��You were yelling your head off!�� said Ron. 

 ��Oh yeah ... I must��ve dozed off or �C�� 

��Harry, please don��t insult our intelligence,�� said Hermione, taking deep breaths. ��We know 

your scar hurt downstairs, and you��re white as a sheet.��

 Harry sat down on the edge of the bath. 

��Fine. I��ve just seen Voldemort murdering a woman. By now he��s probably killed her whole 

family. And he didn��t need to. It was Cedric all over again, they were just there ...�� 

��Harry, you aren��t supposed to let this happen anymore!�� Hermione cried, her voice echoing 
through the bathroom. ��Dumbledore wanted you to use Occlumency! HE thought the connection 
was dangerous �C Voldemort can use it, Harry! What good is it to watch him kill and torture, how 
can it help?��

 ��Because it means I know what he��s doing,�� said Harry.

��168ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��So you��re not even going to try to shut him out?��

 ��Hermione, I can��t. You know I��m lousy at Occlumency. I never got the hang of it.�� 

��You never really tried!�� she said hotly. ��I don��t get it, Harry �C do you like having this special 
connection or relationship or what �C whatever �C��

 She faltered under the look he gave her as he stood up. 

 ��Like it?�� he said quietly. ��Would you like it?��

 ��I �C no �C I��m sorry, Harry. I just didn��t mean �C�� 

��I hate it, I hate the fact that he can get inside me, that I have to watch him when he��s most 

dangerous. But I��m going to use it.��

 ��Dumbledore �C�� 

��Forget Dumbledore. This is my choice, nobody else��s. I want to know why he��s after 

Gregorovitch.��

 ��Who?�� 

��He��s a foreign wandmaker,�� said Harry. ��He made Krum��s wand and Krum reckons he��s 
brilliant.�� 

��But according to you,�� said Ron, ��Voldemort��s got Ollivander locked up somewhere. If he��s 
already got a wandmaker, what does he need another one for?�� 

��Maybe he agrees with Krum, maybe he thinks Gregorovitch is better ... or else he thinks 
Gregorovitch will be able to explain what my wand did when he was chasing me, because 
Ollivander didn��t know.�� 

Harry glanced into the cracked, dusty mirror and saw Ron and Hermione exchanging skeptical 
looks behind his back. 

��Harry, you keep talking about what your wand did,�� said Hermione, ��but you made it happen! 
Why are you so determined not to take responsibility for your own power?�� 

��Because I know it wasn��t me! And so does Voldemort, Hermione! We both know what really 
happened!�� 

They glared at each other; Harry knew that he had not convinced Hermione and that she was 
marshaling counterarguments, against both his theory on his wand and the fact that he was 
permitting himself to see into Voldemort��s mind. 

To his relief, Ron intervened.

��169ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Drop it,�� he advised her. ��It��s up to him. And if we��re going to the Ministry tomorrow, don��t 
you reckon we should go over the plan?�� 

Reluctantly, as the other two could tell, Hermione let the matter rest, though Harry was quite 
sure she would attack again at the first opportunity. In the meantime, they returned to the basement 
kitchen, where Kreacher served them all stew and treacle tart. 

They did not get to bed until late that night, after spending hours going over and over their plan 
until they could recite it, word perfect, to each other. 

Harry, who was now sleeping in Sirius��s room, lay in bed with his wandlight trained��׼ on 
the old photograph of his father, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew, and muttered the plan to himself for 
another ten minutes. As he extinguished his wand, however, he was thinking not of Polyjuice 
Potion, Puking Pastilles, or the navy blue robes of Magical Maintenance; he though of 
Gregorovitch the wandmaker, and how long he could hope to remain hidden while Voldemort 
sought him so determinedly.

 Dawn seemed to follow midnight with indecent haste.

 ��You look terrible,�� was Ron��s greeting as he entered the room to wake Harry.

 ��Not for long,�� said Harry, yawning. 

They found Hermione downstairs in the kitchen. She was being served coffee and hot rolls by 
Kreacher and wearing the slightly manic expression that Harry associated with exam review. 

��Robes,�� she said under her breath, acknowledging their presence with a nervous nod and 
continuing to poke around in her beaded bag, ��Polyjuice Potion ... Invisibiliity Cloak ... Decoy 
Detonators ... You should each take a couple just in case ... Puking Pastilles, Nosebleed Norgat, 
Extendable Ears ...�� 

They gulped down their breakfast, then set off upstairs, Kreacher bowing them out and 
promising to have a steak-and-kidney pie ready for them when they returned. 

��Bless him,�� said Ron fondly, ��and when you think I used to fantasize about cutting off his 
head and sticking it on the wall.�� 

They made their way onto the front step with immense caution. They could see a couple of 
puffy-eyed Death Eaters watching the house from across the misty square. 

 Hermione Disapparated with Ron first, then came back for Harry. 

After the usual brief spell of darkness and near suffocation, Harry found himself in the tiny

��170ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

alleyway where the first phase of their plan was scheduled to take place. It was as yet deserted, 
except for a couple of large bins; the first Ministry workers did not usually appear here until at 
least eight o��clock. 

��Right then,�� said Hermione, checking her watch. ��she ought to be here in about five minutes. 
When I��ve Stunned her �C�� 

��Hermione, we know,�� said Ron sternly. ��And I thought we were supposed to open the door 
before she got here?��

 Hermione squealed. ��I nearly forgot! Stand back �C�� 

She pointed her wand at the padlocked and heavily graffitied fire door (emergency exist) beside 
them, which burst open with a crash. The dark corridor behind it led, as they knew from their 
careful scouting trips, into an empty theater. Hermione pulled the door back toward her, to make it 
look as thought it was still closed. 

��And now,�� she said, turning back to face the other two in the alleyway, ��we put on the Cloak 
again �C��

 ����and we wait,�� Ron finished, throwing it over Hermione��s head like a blanket over a birdcage 
and rolling his eyes at Harry. 

Little more than a minute later, there was a tiny pop and a little Ministry witch with flyaway 
gray hair Apparated feet from them, blinking a little in the sudden brightness, the sun had just 
come out from behind a cloud. She barely had time to enjoy the unexpected warmth, however, 
before Hermione��s silent Stunning Spell hit her in the chest and she toppled over. 

��Nicely done, Hermione,�� said Ron, emerging behind a bin beside the theater door as Harry 
took off the Invisibility Cloak. Together they carried the little witch into the dark passageway that 
led backstage. Hermione plucked a few hairs from the witch��s head and added them to a flask of 
muddy Polyjuice Potion she had taken from the beaded bag. Ron was rummaging through the little 
witch��s handbag. 

��She��s Mafalda Hopkirk,�� he said, reading a small card that identified their victim as an 
assistant in the Improper Use of Magic Office. ��You��d better take this, Hermione, and here are the 
tokens.�� 

He passed her several small golden coins, all embossed with the letters M.O.M., which he had 
taken from the witch��s purse. 

��171ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hermione drank the Polyjuice Potion, which was now a pleasant heliotrope color, and within 
seconds stood before them, the double of Mafalda Hopkirk. As she removed Mafalda��s spectacles 
and put them on, Harry checked his watch. 

 ��We��re running late, Mr. Magical Maintenance will be here any second.�� 

They hurried to close the door on the real Mafalda. Harry and Ron threw the Invisibility Cloak 
over themselves but Hermione remained in view, waiting. Seconds later there was another pop, 
and a small, ferrety looking wizard appeared before them.

 ��Oh, hello, Mafalda.��

 ��Hello!�� said Hermione in a quavery voice, ��How are you today?��

 ��Not so good, actually,�� replied the little wizard, who looked thoroughly downcast. 

 As Hermione and the wizard headed for the main road, Harry and Ron crept along behind them. 

��I��m sorry to hear you��re under the weather,�� said Hermione, talking firmly over the little 
wizard and he tried to expound upon his problems; it was essential to stop him from reaching the 

street. ��Here, have a sweet.��

 ��Eh? Oh, no thanks �C��

 ��I insist!�� said Hermione aggressively, shaking the bag of pastilles in his face. 

Looking rather alarmed, the little wizard took one. 

The effect was instantaneous. The moment the pastille touched his tongue, the little wizard 
started vomiting so hard that he did not even notice as Hermione yanked a handful of hairs from 
the top of his head. 

��Oh dear!�� she said, as he splattered the alley with sick. ��Perhaps you��d better take the day 
off!�� 

��No �C no!�� He choked and retched, trying to continue on his way despite being unable to walk 
straight. ��I must �C today �C must go �C�� 

��But that��s just silly!�� said Hermione, alarmed. ��You can��t go to work in this state �C I think you 
ought to go to St. Mungo��s and get them to sort you out.�� 

The wizard had collapsed, heaving��Ϣ ,��� , onto all fours, still trying to crawl toward the 
main street.

 ��You simply can��t go to work like this!�� cried Hermione. 

At last he seemed to accept the truth of her words. Using a repulsed Hermione to claw his way

��172ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

back into a standing position, he turned on the spot and vanished, leaving nothing behind but the 
bag Ron had snatched from his hand as he went and some flying chunks of vomit. 

��Urgh,�� said Hermione, holding up the skirt�°� ,��Ե of her robe to avoid the puddles of 
sick. ��It would have made much less mess to Stun him too.�� 

��Yeah,�� said Ron, emerging from under the cloak holding the wizard��s bag, ��but I still think a 
whole pile of unconscious bodies would have drawn more attention. Keen on his job, though, isn��t 
he? Chuck us the hair and the potion, then.�� 

Within two minutes, Ron stood before them, as small and ferrety as the sick wizard, and 
wearing the navy blue robes that had been folded in his bag. 

��Weird he wasn��t wearing them today, wasn��t it, seeing how much he wanted to go? Anyway, 
I��m Reg Cattermole, according to the label in the back.�� 

��Now wait here,�� Hermione told Harry, who was still under the Invisibility Cloak, ��and we��ll 
be back with some hairs for you.�� 

He had to wait ten minutes, but it seemed much longer to Harry, skulking alone in the sick-
splattered alleyway beside the door concealing the Stunned Mafalda. Finally Ron and Hermione 
reappeared. 

��We don��t know who he is,�� Hermione said, passing Harry several curly black hairs, ��but he��s 
gone home with a dreadful nosebleed! Here, he��s pretty tall, you��ll need bigger robes ...�� 

She pulled out a set of the old robes Kreacher had laundered for them, and Harry retired to take 
the potion and change. 

Once the painful transformation was complete he was more than six feet tall and, from what he 
could tell from his well-muscled arms, powerfully built. He also had a beard. Stowing the 
Invisibility Cloak and his glasses inside his new robes, he rejoined the other two. 

 ��Blimey, that��s scary,�� said Ron, looking up at Harry, who now towered over him.

 ��Take one of Mafalda��s tokens,�� Hermione told Harry, ��and let��s go, it��s nearly nine.�� 

They stepped out of the alleyway together. Fifty yards along the crowded pavement there were 
spiked black railings flanking two flights of stairs, one labeled GENTLEMEN, the other LADIES. 

��See you in a moment, then,�� said Hermione nervously, and she tottered off down the steps to 
LADIES. Harry and Ron joined a number of oddly dressed men descending into what appeared to 
be an ordinary underground public toilet, tiled in grimy black and white.

��173ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Morning, Reg!�� called another wizard in navy blue robes as he let himself into a cubicle by 
inserting his golden token into a slot in the door. ��Blooming pain in the bum (British slang) 
buttocks, this, eh? Forcing us all to get to work this way! Who are they expecting to turn up, Harry 
Potter?�� 

The wizard roared with laughter at his own wit. Ron gave a forced chuckle. ��Yeah,�� he said, 

��stupid, isn��t it?��

 And he and Harry let themselves into adjoining cubicles. 

To Harry��s left and right came the sound of flushing. He crouched down and peered through the 

gap at the bottom of the cubicle, just in time to see a pair of booted feet climbing into the toilet 

next door. He looked left and saw Ron blinking at him.

 ��We have to flush ourselves in?�� he whispered. 

 ��Looks like it,�� Harry whispered back; his voice came out deep and gravelly.

 They both stood up. Feeling exceptionally foolish, Harry clambered into the toilet. 

He knew at once that he had done the right thing; though he appeared to be standing in water, 
his shoes, feet, and robes remained quite dry. He reached up, pulled the chain, and next moment 
had zoomed down a short chute, emerging out of a fireplace into the Ministry of Magic. 

He got up clumsily; there was a lot more of his body than he was accustomed to. The great 
Atrium seemed darker than Harry remembered it. Previously a golden fountain had filled the 
center of the hall, casting shimmering spots of light over the polished wooden floor and walls. 
Now a gigantic statue of black stone dominated the scene. It was rather frightening, this vast 
sculpture of a witch and a wizard sitting on ornately carved thrones, looking down at the Ministry 
workers toppling out of fireplaces below them. Engraved in foot-high letters at the base of the 
statue were the words MAGIC IS MIGHT. 

Harry received a heavy blow on the back of the legs. Another wizard had just flown out of the 

fireplace behind him.

 ��Out of the way, can��t y �C oh, sorry, Runcorn.�� 

Clearly frightened, the balding wizard hurried away. Apparently the man who Harry was 
impersonating, Runcorn, was intimidating. 

��Psst!�� said a voice, and he looked around to see a whispy little witch and the ferrety wizard 
from Magical Maintenance gesturing to him from over beside the statue. Harry hastened to join

��174ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

them.

 ��You got in all right, then?�� Hermione whispered to Harry.

 ��No, he��s still stuck in the hog,�� said Ron. 

��Oh, very funny ... It��s horrible, isn��t it?�� she said to Harry, who was staring up at the statue. 

��Have you seen what they��re sitting on?�� 

Harry looked more closely and realized that what he had thought were decoratively carved 
thrones were actually mounds of carved humans, hundreds and hundreds of naked bodies, men, 
women and children, all with rather stupid, ugly faces, twisted and pressed together to support the 
weight of the handsomely robed wizards. 

 ��Muggles,�� whispered Hermione, ��In their rightful place. Come on, let��s get going.�� 

They joined the stream of witches and wizards moving toward the golden gates at the end of the 
hall, looking around as surreptitiously as possible, but there was no sign of the distinctive figure of 
Dolores Umbridge. They passed through the gates and into a smaller hall, where queues were 
forming in front of twenty golden grilles housing as many lifts. They had barely joined the nearest 
one when a voice said, ��Cattermole!�� 

They looked around, Harry��s stomach turned over. One of the Death Eaters who had witnessed 
Dumbledore��s death was striding toward them. The Ministry workers beside them fell silent, their 
eyes downcast; Harry could feel fear rippling through them. The man��s scowling, slightly brutish 
face was somehow at odds with his magnificent, sweeping robes, which were embroidered with 
much gold thread. 

Someone in the crowd around the lifts called sycophantically, ��Morning, Yaxley!�� Yaxley 
ignored them. 

��I requested somebody from Magical Maintenance to sort out my office, Cattermole. It��s still 
raining in there.��

 Ron looked around as though hoping somebody else would intervene, but nobody spoke. 

 ��Raining ... in your office? That��s �C that��s not good, is it?��

 Ron gave a nervous laugh. Yaxley��s eyes widened. ��You think it��s funny, Cattermole, do you?��

 A pair of witches broke away from the queue for the lift and bustled off. 

 ��No,�� said Ron, ��no, of course �C�� 

��You realize that I am on my way downstairs to interrogate your wife, Cattermole? In fact, I��m

��175ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

quite surprised you��re not down there holding her hand while she waits. Already given her up as a 
bad job, have you? Probably wise. Be sure and marry a pureblood next time.�� 

Hermione had let out a little squeak of horror. Yaxley looked at her. She cough feebly and 
turned away.

 ��I �C I �C�� stammered Ron. 

��But if my wife were accused of being a Mudblood,�� said Yaxley, ����not that any woman I 
married would ever be mistaken for such filth �C and the Head of Department of Magical Law 
Enforcement needed a job doing, I would make it my priority to do this job, Cattermole. Do you 
understand me?��

 ��Yes,�� whispered Ron. 

��Then attend to it, Cattermole, and if my office is not completely dry within an hour, your 
wife��s Blood Status will be in even greater doubt than it is now.�� 

The golden grille before them clattered open. With a nod and unpleasant smile to Harry, who 
was evidently expected to appreciate this treatment of Cattermole, Yaxley swept away toward 
another lift. Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered theirs, but nobody followed them. It was as if they 
were infectious. The grilles shut with a clang and the lift began to move upward. 

��What am I going to do?�� Ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken. ��If I don��t turn 
up, my wife ... I mean, Cattermole��s wife �C�� 

��We��ll come with you, we should stick together �C�� began Harry, but Ron shook his head 
feverishly. 

��That��s mental, we haven��t got much time. You two find Umbridge, I��ll go and sort out 
Yaxley��s office �C but how do I stop a raining?�� 

��Try Finite Incantatem,�� said Hermione at once, ��that should stop the rain if it��s a hex or curse; 
if it doesn��t something��s gone wrong with an Atmospheric Charm, which will be more difficult to 
fix, so as an interim measure try Impervius to protect his belongings �C�� 

��Say it again, slowly �C�� said Ron, searching his pockets desperately for a quill, but at that 
moment the lift juddered (shudder) to a halt. A disembodied female voice said, ��Level four, 
Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, incorporating Beast, Being, and 
Spirit Divisions, Goblin Liaison Office, and Pest Advisory Bureau,�� and the grilles slid open 
again, admitting a couple of wizards and several pale violet paper airplanes that fluttered around

��176ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the lamp in the ceiling of the lift.

 ��Morning, Albert,�� said a bushily whiskered man, smiling at Harry. He glanced over at Ron and 
Hermione as the lift creaked upward once more; Hermione was now whispering frantic 
instructions to Ron. The wizard leaned toward Harry, leering, and muttering ��Dirk Cresswell, eh? 
From Goblin Liaison? Nice one, Albert. I��m pretty confident I��ll get his job now!�� 

He winked. Harry smiled back, hoping that this would suffice. The lift stopped; the grilles 
opened once more. 

��Level two, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, including the Improper Use of Magic 
Office, Auror Headquarters, and Wizengamot Administration Services,�� said the disembodied 
witch��s voice. 

Harry saw Hermione give Ron a little push and he hurried out of the lift, followed by the other 
wizards, leaving Harry and Hermione alone. The moment the golden door had closed Hermione 
said, very fast, ��Actually, Harry, I think I��d better go after him, I don��t think he knows what he��s 
doing and if he gets caught the whole thing �C��

 ��Level one, Minister of Magic and Support Staff.��

 The golden grilles slid apart again and Hermione gasped. Four people stood before them, two of 
them deep in conversation, a long-haired wizard wearing magnificent robes of black and gold, and 
a squat, toadlike witch wearing a velvet bow in her short hair and clutching a clipboard to her 
chest.

Chapter Thirteen 
The Muggle-Born Registration Commission 


��Ah, Mafalda!�� said Umbridge, looking at 


Hermione. 

��Travers sent you, did he?��

 ��Y-yes,�� squeaked Hermione. 

��God, you��ll do perfectly well.�� Umbridge 

spoke to the 
wizard in black and gold. ��That��s that 

problem 
solved. Minister, if Mafalda can be spared for 

record-keeping 
we shall be able to start straightaway.�� She 

consulted her 
clipboard. ��Ten people today and one of them the wife of a Ministry employee! Tut, tut... even 
here, in the heart of the Ministry!�� She stepped into the lift besides Hermione, as did the two 
wizards who had been listening to Umbridge��s conversation with the Minister. ��We��ll go straight 
down, Mafalda, you��ll find everything you need in the courtroom. Good morning, Albert, aren��t 
you getting out?��

 ��Yes, of course,�� said Harry in Runcorn��s deep voice. 

Harry stepped out of the life. The golden grilles clanged shut behind him. Glancing over his 
shoulder, Harry saw Hermione��s anxious face sinking back out of sight, a tall wizard on either side 
of her, Umbridge��s velvet hair-bow level with her shoulder. 

��What brings you here, Runcorn?�� asked the new Minister of Magic. His long black hair and 
beard were streaked with silver and a great overhanging forehead shadowed his glinting eyes, 
putting Harry in the mind of a crab looking out from beneath a rock. 

��Needed a quick word with,�� Harry hesitated for a fraction of a second, ��Arthur Weasley. 

Someone said he was up on level one.��

 ��Ah,�� said Plum Thicknesse. ��Has he been caught having contact with an Undesirable?��

 ��No,�� said Harry, his throat dry. ��No, nothing like that.�� 

��Ah, well. It��s only a matter of time,�� said Thicknesse. ��If you ask me, the blood traitors are as 

bad as the Mudbloods. Good day, Runcorn.��

 ��Good day, Minister.�� 

Harry watched Thicknesse march away along the thickly carpeted corridor. The moment the

��178ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Minister had passed out of sight, Harry tugged the Invisibility Cloak out from under his heavy 
black cloak, threw it over himself, and set off along the corridor in the opposite direction. Runcorn 
was so tall that Harry was forced to stoop to make sure his big feet were hidden. 

Panic pulsed in the pit of his stomach. As he passed gleaming wooden door after gleaming 
wooden door, each bearing a small plaque with the owner��s name and occupation upon it, the 
might of the Ministry, its complexity, its impenetrability, seemed to force itself upon him so that 
the plan he had been carefully concocting with Ron and Hermione over the past four weeks 
seemed laughably childish. They had concentrated all their efforts on getting inside without being 
detected. They had not given a moment��s thought to what they would do if they were forced to 
separate. 

Now Hermione was stuck in court proceedings, which would undoubtedly last hours; Ron was 
struggling to do magic that Harry was sure was beyond him, a woman��s liberty possibly depending 
on the outcome, and he, Harry, was wandering around on the top floor when he knew perfectly 
well that his quarry had just gone down in the lift. 

He stopped walking, leaned against a wall, and tried to decide what to do. The silence pressed 
upon him. There was no bustling or talk or swift footsteps here, the purple-carpeted corridors were 
as hushed as though the Muffliato charm had been cast over the place. 

Her office must be up here, Harry thought. 

It seemed most unlikely that Umbridge would keep her jewelry in her office, but on the other 
hand it seemed foolish not to search it to make sure. He therefore set off along the corridor again, 
passing nobody but a frowning wizard who was murmuring instructions to a quill that floated in 
front of him, scribbling on a trail of parchment. 

Now paying attention to the names on the doors, Harry turned a corner. Halfway along the next 
corridor he emerged into a wide, open space where a dozen witches and wizards sat in rows at 
small desks not unlike school desks, though much more highly polished and free from graffiti. 
Harry paused to watch them, for the effect was quite mesmerizing. They were all waving and 
twiddling their wands in unison, and squares of colored paper were flying in every direction like 
little pink kites. After a few seconds, Harry realized that there was a rhythm to the proceedings, 
that the papers all formed the same pattern and after a few more seconds he realized what he was

��179ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

watching was the creation of pamphlets �C that the paper squares were pages, which, when 
assembled, folded and magicked into place, fell into neat stacks beside each witch or wizard. 

Harry crept closer, although the workers were so intent on what they were doing that he 
doubted they would notice a carpet-muffled footstep, and he slid a completed pamphlet from the 
pile beside a young witch. He examined it beneath the Invisibility Cloak. Its pink cover was 
emblazoned with a golden title, 

MUDBLOODS 

and the Dangers They Pose to 
a Peaceful Pure-Blood Society 

Beneath the title was a picture of a red rose with a simpering face in the middle of its petals, 
being strangled by a green weed with fangs and a scowl. There was no author��s name upon the 
pamphlet, but again, the scars on the back of his right hand seemed to tingle as he examined it. 
Then the young witch beside him confirmed his suspicion as she said, still waving and twirling her 
wand, ��Will the old hag be interrogating Mudbloods all day, does anyone know?�� 

��Careful,�� said the wizard beside her, glancing around nervously; one of his pages slipped and 

fell to the floor. 

 ��What, has she got magic ears as well as an eye, now?��

 The witch glanced toward the shining mahogany door facing the space full of pamphlet-makers; 
Harry looked too, and the rage reared in him like a snake. Where there might have been a peephole 
on a Muggle front door, a large, round eye with a bright blue iris��Ĥ had been set into the wood 

�C an eye that was shockingly familiar to anybody who had known Alastor Moody. 
For a split second Harry forgot where he was and what he was doing there. He even forgot that 
he was invisible. He strode straight over to the door to examine the eye. It was not moving. It 
gazed blindly upward, frozen. The plaque beneath it read, 

Dolores Umbridge 
Senior Undersecretary to the Minister


 Below that a slightly shinier new plaque read, 
Head of the Muggle-Born 
Registration Commission


��180ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry looked back at the dozen pamphlet-makers. Though they were intent upon their work, he 
could hardly suppose that they would not notice if the door of an empty office opened in front of 
them. He therefore withdrew from an inner pocket an odd object with little waving legs and a 
rubber-bulbed horn for a body. Crouching down beneath the Cloak, he placed the Decoy Detonator 
on the ground. 

It scuttled away at once through the legs of the witches and wizards in front of him. A few 
moments later, during which Harry waited with his hand upon the doorknob, there came a loud 
bang and a great deal of acrid smoke billowed from a corner. The young witch in the front row 
shrieked. Pink pages flew everywhere as she and her fellows jumped up, looking around for the 
source of the commotion. Harry turned the doorknob, stepped into Umbridge��s office, and closed 
the door behind him. 

He felt he had stepped back in time. The room was exactly like Umbridge��s office at Hogwarts. 
Lace draperies, doilies and dried flowers covered every surface. The walls bore the same 
ornamental plates, each featuring a highly colored, be-ribboned kitten, gamboling and frisking with 
sickening cuteness. The desk was covered with a flouncy���Ժ�Ҷ�� , flowered cloth. Behind 
Mad-eye��s eye, a telescopic attachment enabled Umbridge to spy on the workers on the other side 
of the door. Harry took a look through it and saw that they were all still gathered around the Decoy 
Detonator. He wrenched the telescope out of the door, leaving a hole behind, pulled the magical 
eyeball out of it, and placed it in his pocket. The he turned to face the room again, raised his wand, 
and murmured, ��Accio Locket.�� 

Nothing happened, but he had not expected it to; no doubt Umbridge knew all about protective 
charms and spells. He therefore hurried behind her desk and began pulling open all the drawers. 
He saw quills and notebooks and Spellotape; enchanted paper clips that coiled snakelike from their 
drawer and had to be beaten back; a fussy little lace box full of spare hair bows and clips; but no 
sign of a locket. 

There was a filing cabinet behind the desk, Harry set to searching it. Like Filch��s filing cabinet 
at Hogwarts, it was full of folders, each labeled with a name. It was not until Harry reached the 
bottommost drawer that he saw something to distract him from the search: Mr. Weasley's file.

 He pulled it out and opened it.

Arthur Weasley 



BLOOD STATUS: Pureblood, but with unacceptable pro-Muggle leanings. Known member of 
the Order of the Phoenix 

FAMILY: Wife (pureblood), seven children, two youngest at Hogwarts. NB: Youngest 
son currently at home, seriously ill, Ministry inspectors have 
confirmed. 

SECURITY STATUS: TRACKED. All movements are being 
monitored. Strong likelihood Undesirable No. 1 will 
contact (has stayed with Weasley family previously) 

��Undesirable Number One,�� Harry muttered under his breath as he replaced Mr. Weasley��s 
folder and shut the drawer. He had an idea he knew who that was, and sure enough, as he 
straightened up and glanced around the office for fresh hiding places he saw a poster of himself on 
the wall, with the words UNDESIRABLE NO. 1 emblazoned across his chest. A little pink note 
was stuck to it with a picture of a kitten in the corner. Harry moved across to read it and saw that 
Umbridge had written, ��To be punished.�� 

Angrier than ever, he proceeded to grope in the bottoms of the vases and baskets of dried 
flowers, but was not at all surprised that the locket was not there. He gave the office one last 
sweeping look, and his heart skipped a beat. Dumbledore was staring at him from a small 
rectangular mirror, propped up on a bookcase beside the desk. 

Harry crossed the room at a run and snatched it up, but realized that the moment he touched it 
that it was not a mirror at all. Dumbledore was smiling wistfully out of the front cover of a glossy 
book. Harry had not immediately noticed the curly green writing across his hat �C The Life and Lies 
of Albus Dumbledore �C nor the slightly smaller writing across his chest, ��by Rita Skeeter, 
bestselling author of Armando Dippet, Master or Moron?�� 

Harry opened the book at random and saw a full-page photograph of two teenage boys, both

��182ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

laughing immoderately with their arms around each other��s shoulders. Dumbledore, now with 
elbow-length hair, had grown a tiny wispy beard that recalled the one on Krum��s chin that had so 
annoyed Ron. The boy who roared in silent amusement beside Dumbledore had a gleeful, wild 
look about him. His golden hair fell in curls to his shoulders. Harry wondered whether it was a 
young Doge, but before he could check the caption, the door of the office opened. 

If Thicknesse had not been looking over his shoulder as he entered, Harry would not have had 
time to pull the Invisibility Cloak over himself. As it was, he thought Thicknesse might have 
caught a glimpse of movement, because for a moment or two he remained quite still, staring 
curiously at the place where Harry had just vanished. Perhaps deciding that that all he had seen 
was Dumbledore scratching his nose on the front of the book, for Harry had hastily replaced it 
upon the shelf. Thicknesse finally walked to the desk and pointed his wand at the quill standing 
ready in the ink pot. It sprang out and began scribbling a note to Umbridge. Very slowly, hardly 
daring to breathe, Harry backed out of the office into the open area beyond. 

The pamphlet-makers were still clustered around the remains of the Decoy Detonator, which 
continued to hoot feebly as it smoked. Harry hurried off up the corridor as the young witch said, ��I 
bet it sneaked up here from Experimental Charms, they��re so careless, remember that poisonous 
duck?�� 

Speeding back toward the lifts, Harry reviewed his options. It had never been likely that the 
locket was here at the Ministry, and there was no hope of bewitching its whereabouts out of 
Umbridge while she was sitting in a crowded court. Their priority now had to be to leave the 
Ministry before they were exposed, and try again another day. The first thing to do was to find 
Ron, and then they could work out a way of extracting Hermione from the courtroom. 

The lift was empty when it arrived. Harry jumped in and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak as it 
started its descent. To his enormous relief, when it rattled to a halt at level two, a soaking-wet and 
wild-eyed Ron got in.

 ��M-morning,�� he stammered to Harry as the lift set off again.

 ��Ron, it��s me, Harry!��

 ��Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like �C why isn��t Hermione with you?��

 ��She had to go down to the courtrooms with Umbridge, she couldn��t refuse, and �C�� 

But before Harry could finish the lift had stopped again. The doors opened and Mr. Weasley

��183ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

walked inside, talking to an elderly witch whose blonde hair was teased (pull hair away from scalp 

and comb towards the head in order to make hair look thicker) so high it resembled an anthill.

 ��... I quite understand what you��re saying, Wakanda, but I��m afraid I cannot be party to �C�� 

Mr. Weasley broke off; he had noticed Harry. It was very strange to have Mr. Weasley glare at 
him with that much dislike. The lift doors closed and the four of them trundled downward once 
more. 

��Oh hello, Reg,�� said Mr. Weasley, looking around at the sound of steady dripping from Ron��s 
robes. ��Isn��t your wife in for questioning today? Er �C what��s happened to you? Why are you so 
wet?�� 

��Yaxley��s office is raining,�� said Ron. He addressed Mr. Weasley��s shoulder, and Harry felt 
sure he was scared that his father might recognize him if they looked directly into each other��s 
eyes. ��I couldn��t stop it, so they��ve sent me to get Bernie �C Pillsworth, I think they said �C�� 

��Yes, a lot of offices have been raining lately,�� said Mr. Weasley. ��Did you try Meterolojinx 

Recanto? It worked for Bletchley.��

 ��Meteolojinx Recanto?�� whispered Ron. ��No, I didn��t. Thanks, D �C I mean, thanks, Arthur.�� 

The lift doors opened; the old witch with the anthill hair left, and Ron darted past her out of 
sight. Harry made to follow him, but found his path blocked as Percy Weasley strode into the lift, 
his nose buried in some papers he was reading. 

Not until the doors had clanged shut again did Percy realize he was in a lift with his father. He 
glanced up, saw Mr. Weasley, turned radish red, and left the lift the moment the doors opened 
again. For the second time, Harry tried to get out, but this time found his way blocked by Mr. 
Weasley��s arm.

 ��One moment, Runcorn.��

 The lift doors closed and as they clanked down another floor, Mr. Weasley said, ��I hear you had 
information about Dirk Cresswell.�� 

Harry had the impression that Mr. Weasley��s anger was no less because of the brush with 
Percy. He decided his best chance was to act stupid. 

 ��Sorry?�� he said. 

 ��Don��t pretend, Runcorn,�� said Mr. Weasley fiercely. ��You tracked down the wizard who faked 

his family tree, didn��t you?��

��184ҳ��

��I �C so what if I did?�� said Harry. 

��So Dirk Cresswell is ten times the wizard you are,�� said Mr. Weasley quietly, as the lift sank 
ever lower. ��And if he survives Azkaban, you��ll have to answer to him, not to mention his wife, 
his sons, and his friends -��

 ��Arthur,�� Harry interrupted, ��you know you��re being tracked, don��t you?��

 ��Is that a threat, Runcorn?�� said Mr. Weasley loudly.

 ��No,�� said Harry, ��it��s a fact! They��re watching your every move �C�� 

The lift doors opened. They had reached the Atrium. Mr. Weasley gave Harry a scathing look 
and swept from the lift. Harry stood there, shaken. He wished he was impersonating somebody 
other than Runcorn. The lift doors clanged shut. 

Harry pulled out the Invisibility Cloak and put it back on. He would try to extricate Hermione 
on his own while Ron was dealing with the raining office. When the doors opened, he stepped out 
into a torch-lit stone passageway quite different from the wood-paneled and carpeted corridors 
above. As the lift rattled away again, Harry shivered slightly, looking toward the distant black door 
that marked the entrance to the Department of Mysteries. 

He set off, his destination not the black door, but the doorway he remembered on the left hand 
side, which opened onto the flight of stairs down to the court chambers. His mind grappled with 
possibilities as he crept down them. He still had a couple of Decoy Detonators, but perhaps it 
would be better to simply knock on the courtroom door, enter as Runcorn, and ask for a quick 
word with Mafalda? Of course, he did not know whether Runcorn was sufficiently important to get 
away with this, and even if he managed it, Hermione��s non-reappearance might trigger a search 
before they were clear of the Ministry. 

Lost in thought, he did not immediately register the unnatural chill that was creeping over him, 
as if he were descending into fog. It was becoming colder and colder with every step he took; a 
cold that reached right down his throat and tore at his lungs. And then he felt that stealing sense of 
despair, or hopelessness, filling him, expanding inside him. 

Dementors, he thought. 

And as he reached the foot of the stairs and turned to his right he saw a dreadful scene. The dark 
passage outside the courtrooms was packed with tall, black-hooded figures, their faces completely 
hidden, their ragged breathing the only sound in the place. The petrified Muggle-borns brought in

��185ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

for questioning sat huddled and shivering on hard wooden benches. Most of them were hiding their 
faces in their hands, perhaps in an instinctive attempt to shield themselves from the dementors�� 
greedy mouths. Some were accompanied by families, others sat alone. The dementors were gliding 
up and down in front of them, and the cold, the hopelessness and the despair of the place laid 
themselves upon Harry like a curse. 

Fight it, he told himself, but he knew that he could not conjure a Patronus here without 
revealing himself instantly. So he moved forward as silently as he could, and with every step he 
took numbness seemed to steal over his brain, but he forced himself to think of Hermione and of 
Ron, who needed him. 

Moving through the towering black figures was terrifying. The eyeless faces hidden beneath 
their hoods turned as he passed, and he felt sure that they sensed him, sensed, perhaps, a human 
presence that still had some hope, some resilience. 

And then, abruptly and shockingly amid the frozen silence, one of the dungeon doors on the left 
of the corridor was flung open and screams echoed out of it. 

"No, no, I��m half-blood, I��m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard, he was, look him 
up, Arkie Alderton, he��s a well known broomstick designer, look him up, I tell you �C get your 
hands off me, get your hands off �C" 

��This is your final warning,�� said Umbridge��s soft voice, magically magnified so that it 
sounded clearly over the man��s desperate screams. ��If you struggle, you will be subjected to the 
Dementor��s Kiss.��

 The man��s screams subsided, but dry sobs echoed through the corridor. 

 ��Take him away,�� said Umbridge. 

Two dementors appeared in the doorway of the courtroom, their rotting, scabbed hands 
clutching the upper arms of a wizard who appeared to be fainting. They glided away down the 
corridor with him, and the darkness they trailed behind them swallowed him from sight.

 ��Next �C Mary Cattermole,�� called Umbridge. 

A small woman stood up; she was trembling from head to foot. Her dark hair was smoothed 
back into a bun and she wore long plain robes. Her face was completely bloodless. As she passed 
the dementors, Harry saw her shudder. 

He did it instinctively, without any sort of plan, because he hated the sight of her walking alone

��186ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

into the dungeon. As the door began to swing closed, he slipped into the courtroom behind her. 

It was not the same room in which he had once been interrogated for improper use of magic. 
This one was much smaller, though the ceiling was quite as high; it gave the claustrophobic�ıտ�
��֢ sense of being stuck at the bottom of a deep well. 

There were more dementors in here, casting their freezing aura over the place; they stood like 
faceless sentinels in the corners farthest from the high raised platform. Here, behind a balustrade��
��, sat Umbridge, with Yaxley on one side of her, and Hermione, quite as white-faced as Mrs. 
Cattermole, on the other. At the foot of the platform, a bright-silver, long-haired cat prowled up 
and down, up and down, up and down, and Harry realized that it was there to protect the 
prosecutors from the despair that emanated from the dementors. 

That was for the accused to feel, not the accusers. 

��Sit down,�� said Umbridge in her soft, silky voice. 

Mrs. Cattermole stumbled to the single seat in the middle of the floor beneath the raised 
platform. The moment she had sat down, chains clinked out of the arms of the chair and bound her 

there. 

��You are Mary Elizabeth Cattermole?�� asked Umbridge. 

Mrs. Cattermole gave a single, shaky nod. 

��Married to Reginald Cattermole of the Magical Maintenance Department?�� 

Mrs. Cattermole burst into tears. ��I don��t know where he is, he was supposed to meet me here!�� 

Umbridge ignored her. ��Mother to Maisie, Ellie, and Alfred Cattermole?�� 

Mrs. Cattermole sobbed harder than ever. ��They��re frightened, they think I might not come 

home -��

 ��Spare us,�� spat Yaxley. ��The brats of Mudbloods do not stir our sympathies.�� 

Mrs. Cattermole��s sobs masked Harry��s footsteps as he made his way carefully toward the steps 
that led up to the raised platform. The moment he had passed the place where the Patronus cat 
patrolled, he felt the change in temperature. It was warm and comfortable here. The Patronus, he 
was sure, was Umbridge��s, and it glowed brightly because she was so happy here, in her element, 
upholding the twisted laws she had helped to write. 

Slowly and very carefully he edged his way along the platform behind Umbridge, Yaxley, and 
Hermione, taking a seat behind the latter. He was worried about making Hermione jump. He

��187ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

thought of casting the Muffliato charm upon Umbridge and Yaxley, but even murmuring the word 
might cause Hermione alarm. 

Then Umbridge raised her voice to address Mrs. Cattermole, and Harry seized his chance.

 ��I��m behind you,�� he whispered into Hermione��s ear. 

As he had expected, she jumped so violently she nearly overturned the bottle of ink with which 
she was supposed to be recording the interview, but both Umbridge and Yaxley were concentrating 
upon Mrs. Cattermole, and this went unnoticed. 

��A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today, Mrs. Cattermole,�� 
Umbridge was saying. ��Eight-and-three-quarter inches, cherry, unicorn-hair core. Do you 
recognize the description?��

 Mrs. Cattermole nodded, mopping her eyes on her sleeve.

 ��Could you please tell us from which witch or wizard you took that wand?�� 

��T-took?�� sobbed Mrs. Cattermole. ��I didn��t t-take it from anybody. I b-bought it when I was 
eleven years old. It �C it �C it �C chose me.��

 She cried harder than ever. 

Umbridge laughed a soft girlish laugh that made Harry want to attack her. She leaned forward 
over the barrier, the better to observe her victim, and something gold swung forward too, and 
dangled over the void, the locket. 

Hermione had seen it; she let out a little squeak, but Umbridge and Yaxley, still intent upon 
their prey, were deaf to everything else. 

��No,�� said Umbridge, ��no, I don��t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose witches or 
wizards. You are not a witch. I have your responses to the questionnaire that was sent to you here �C 
Mafalda, pass them to me.�� 

Umbridge held out a small hand. She looked so toadlike at that moment that Harry was quite 
surprised not to see webs between the stubby fingers. Hermione��s hands were shaking with shock. 
She fumbled in a pile of documents balanced on the chair beside her, finally withdrawing a sheaf 
of parchment with Mrs. Cattermole��s name on it. 

��That��s �C that��s pretty, Dolores,�� she said, pointing at the pendant gleaming in the ruffled folds 
of Umbridge��s blouse. 

��What?�� snapped Umbridge, glancing down. ��Oh yes �C an old family heirloom,�� she said,

��188ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

patting the locket lying on her large bosom. ��The S stands for Selwyn. I am related to the Selwyns. 
Indeed, there are few pure-blood families to whom I am not related. A pity,�� she continued in a 
louder voice, flicking through Mrs. Cattermole��s questionnaire, ��that the same cannot be said for 
you. 'Parents' professions, greengrocers'.�� 

Yaxley laughed jeeringly. Below, the fluffy silver cat patrolled up and down, and the dementors 
stood waiting in the corners. 

It was Umbridge��s lie that brought the blood surging into Harry��s brain and obliterated his 
sense of caution �C that the locket she had taken as a bribe from a petty criminal was being used to 
bolster her own pure-blood credentials. He raised his wand, not even troubling to keep it concealed 
beneath the Invisibility Cloak, and said, ��Stupefy!�� 

There was a flash of red light; Umbridge crumpled and her forehead hit the edge of the 
balustrade, Mrs. Cattermole��s papers slid off her lap onto the floor and, down below, the prowling 
silver cat vanished. Ice-cold air hit them like an oncoming wind. Yaxley, confused, looked around 
for the source of the trouble and saw Harry��s disembodied hand and wand pointing at him. He tried 
to draw his own wand, but too late, ��Stupefy!��

 Yaxley slid to the ground to lie curled on the floor. 

 ��Harry!��

 ��Hermione, if you think I was going to sit here and let her pretend �C��

 ��Harry, Mrs. Cattermole!�� 

Harry whirled around, throwing off the Invisibility Cloak; down below, the dementors had 
moved out of their corners; they were gliding toward the woman chained to the chair, Whether 
because the Patronus had vanished or because they sensed that their masters were no longer in 
control, they seemed to have abandoned restraint. Mrs. Cattermole let out a terrible scream of fear 
as a slimy, scabbed hand grasped her chin and forced her face back. 

��EXPECTO PATRONUM!�� 

The silver stag soared from the tip of Harry��s wand and leaped toward the dementors, which 
fell back and melted into the dark shadows again. The stag��s light, more powerful and more 
warming than the cat��s protection, filled the whole dungeon as it cantered around the room.

 ��Get the Horcrux,�� Harry told Hermione. 

He ran back down the steps, stuffing the Invisibility Cloak into his back, and approached Mrs.

��189ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cattermole. 

��You?�� she whispered, gazing into his face. ��But �C but Reg said you were the one who 
submitted my name for questioning!�� 

��Did I?�� muttered Harry, tugging at the chains binding her arms, ��Well, I��ve had a change of 
heart. Diffindo!�� 

Nothing happened. ��Hermione, how do I get rid of these chains?�� 

��Wait, I��m trying something up here �C��

 ��Hermione, we��re surrounded by dementors!�� 

��I know that, Harry, but if she wakes up and the locket��s gone �C I need to duplicate it �C 
Geminio! There... That should fool her... .��

 Hermione came running downstairs. 

 ��Let��s see... . Relashio!�� 

The chains clinked and withdrew into the arms of the chair. Mrs. Cattermole looked just as 

frightened as ever before. 

 ��I don��t understand,�� she whispered. 

��You��re going to leave here with us,�� said Harry, pulling her to her feet. ��Go home, grab your 
children, and get out, get out of the country if you��ve got to. Disguise yourselves and run. You��ve 
seen how it is, you won��t get anything like a fair hearing here.�� 

��Harry,�� said Hermione, ��how are we going to get out of here with all those dementors outside 
the door?�� 

��Patronuses,�� said Harry, pointing his wand at his own. The stag slowed and walked, still 
gleaming brightly, toward the door. ��As many as we can muster; do yours, Hermione.��

 ��Expec �C Expecto patronum,�� said Hermione. Nothing happened. 

��It��s the only spell she ever has trouble with,�� Harry told a completely bemused Mrs. 
Cattermole. ��Bit unfortunate, really... Come on Hermione... .�� 

"Expecto patronum!" 

A silver otter burst from the end of Hermione��s wand and swam gracefully through the air to 

join the stag. 

 ��C��mon,�� said Harry, and he led Hermione and Mrs. Cattermole to the door. 

When the Patronuses glided out of the dungeon there were cries of shock from the people

��190ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

waiting outside. Harry looked around; the dementors were falling back on both sides of them, 
melding (blend, merge) into the darkness, scattering before the silver creatures. 

��It��s been decided that you should all go home and go into hiding with your families,�� Harry 
told the waiting Muggle-born, who were dazzled by the light of the Patronuses and still cowering 
slightly. ��Go abroad if you can. Just get well away from the Ministry. That��s the �C er �C new official 
position. Now, if you��ll just follow the Patronuses, you��ll be able to leave the Atrium.�� 

They managed to get up the stone stops without being intercepted, but as they approached the 
lifts Harry started to have misgivings. If they emerged into the Atrium with a silver stag, and otter 
soaring alongside it, and twenty or so people, half of them accused Muggle-borns, he could not 
help feeling that they would attract unwanted attention. He had just reached this unwelcome 
conclusion when the lift clanged to a halt in front of them. 

��Reg!�� screamed Mrs. Cattermole, and she threw herself into Ron��s arms. ��Runcorn let me out, 
he attacked Umbridge and Yaxley, and he��s told all of us to leave the country. I think we��d better 
do it, Reg, I really do, let��s hurry home and fetch the children and �C why are you so wet?�� 

��Water,�� muttered Ron, disengaging himself. ��Harry, they know there are intruders inside the 
Ministry, something about a hole in Umbridge��s office door. I reckon we��ve got five minutes if 
that �C��

 Hermione��s Patronus vanished with a pop as she turned a horror struck face to Harry.

 ��Harry, if we��re trapped here �C!�� 

��We won��t be if we move fast,�� said Harry. He addressed the silent group behind them, who 
were all gawping at him.

 ��Who��s got wands?��

 About half of them raised their hands. 

��Okay, all of you who haven��t got wands need to attach yourself to somebody who has. We��ll 
need to be fast before they stop us. Come on.�� 

They managed to cram themselves into two lifts. Harry��s Patronus stood sentinel before the 
golden grilles as they shut and the lifts began to rise. 

 ��Level eight,�� said the witch��s cool voice, ��Atrium.�� 

Harry knew at once that they were in trouble. The Atrium was full of people moving from 

fireplace to fireplace, sealing them off. 

��191ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Harry!�� squeaked Hermione. ��What are we going to �C?�� 

��STOP!�� Harry thundered, and the powerful voice of Runcorn echoed through the Atrium, The 
wizards sealing the fireplaces froze. ��Follow me,�� he whispered to the group of terrified Muggleborns, 
who moved forward in a huddle, shepherded by Ron and Hermione. 

��What��s up, Albert?�� said the same balding wizard who had followed Harry out of the fireplace 
earlier. He looked nervous. 

��This lot need to leave before you seal the exits,�� said Harry with all the authority he could 
muster.

 The group of wizards in front of him looked at one another.

 ��We��ve been told to seal all exits and not let anyone �C�� 

��Are you contradicting me?�� Harry blustered. ��Would you like me to have your family tree 
examined, like I had Dirk Cresswell��s?�� 

��Sorry!�� gasped the balding wizard, backing away. ��I didn��t mean nothing, Albert, but I 
thought... I thought they were in for questioning and...�� 

��Their blood is pure,�� said Harry, and his deep voice echoed impressively through the hall. 
��Purer than many of yours, I daresay. Off you go,�� he boomed to the Muggle-borns, who scurried 
forward into the fireplaces and began to vanish in pairs. The Ministry wizards hung back, some 
looking confused, others scared and fearful. Then:

 ��Mary!�� 

Mrs. Cattermole looked over her shoulder. The real Reg Cattermole, no longer vomiting but 
pale and wan, had just come running out of a lift.

 ��R- Reg?��

 She looked from her husband to Ron, who swore loudly.

 The balding wizard gaped, his head turning ludicrously from one Reg Cattermole to the other. 

 ��Hey �C what��s going on? What is this?��

 ��Seal the exit! SEAL IT!�� 

Yaxley had burst out of another lift and was running toward the group beside the fireplaces, 
into which all of the Muggle-borns but Mrs. Cattermole had now vanished. As the balding wizard 
lifted his wand, Harry raised an enormous fist and punched him, sending him flying through the 
air.

��192ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He��s been helping Muggle-borns escape, Yaxley!�� Harry shouted. 

The balding wizard��s colleagues set up an uproar, under cover of which Ron grabbed Mrs. 
Cattermole, pulled her into the still-open fireplace, and disappeared. Confused, Yaxley looked 
from Harry to the punched wizard, while the real Reg Cattermole screamed, ��My wife! Who was 
that with my wife? What��s going on?��

 Harry saw Yaxley��s head turn, saw an inkling of truth dawn on that brutish face. 

��Come on!�� Harry shouted at Hermione; he seized her hand and they jumped into the fireplace 
together as Yaxley��s curse sailed over Harry��s head. They spun for a few seconds before shooting 
up out of a toilet into a cubicle. Harry flung open the door, Ron was standing there beside the 
sinks, still wrestling with Mrs. Cattermole.

 ��Reg, I don��t understand �C��

 ��Let go, I��m not your husband, you��ve got to go home!��

 There was a noise in the cubicle behind them; Harry looked around; Yaxley had just appeared. 

��LET��S GO!�� Harry yelled. He seized Hermione by the hand and Ron by the arm and turned on 
the stop. 

Darkness engulfed them, along with the sensation of compressing hands, but something was 
wrong. Hermione��s hand seemed to be sliding out of his grip. 

He wondered whether he was going to suffocate; he could not breathe or see and the only solid 
things in the world were Ron��s arm and Hermione��s fingers, which were slowly slipping away. 

And then he saw the door to number twelve, Grimmauld Place, with its serpent door knocker, 
but before he could draw breath, there was a scream and a flash of purple light, Hermione��s hand 
was suddenly vise-like upon his and everything went dark again.

Chapter Fourteen 

The Thief 

Harry opened his eyes and was dazzled by 


gold and 
green; he had no idea what had happened, he 

only knew 
that he was lying on what seemed to be leaves 

and twigs. 
Struggling to draw breath into lungs that felt 

flattened, he 
blinked and realized that the gaudy glare was 

sunlight 
streaming through a canopy of leaves far above him. Then an object twitched close to his face. He 
pushed himself onto his hands and knees, ready to face some small, fierce creature, but saw that 
the object was Ron��s foot. Looking around, Harry saw that they and Hermione were lying on a 
forest floor, apparently alone. 

Harry��s first thought was of the Forbidden Forest, and for a moment, even though he knew how 
foolish and dangerous it would be for them to appear in the grounds of Hogwarts, his heart leapt at 
the thought of sneaking through the trees to Hagrid��s hut. However, in the few moments it took for 
Ron to give a low groan and Harry to start crawling toward him, he realized that this was not the 
Forbidden Forest; The trees looked younger, they were more widely spaced, the ground clearer. 

He met Hermione, also on her hands and knees, at Ron��s head. The moment his eyes fell upon 
Ron, all other concerns fled Harry��s mind, for blood drenched the whole of Ron��s left side and his 
face stood out, grayish-white, against the leaf-strewn earth. The Polyjuice Potion was wearing off 
now, Ron was halfway between Cattermole and himself in appearance, his hair turning redder and 
redder as his face drained of the little color it had left.

 ��What��s happened to him?�� 

��Splinched,�� said Hermione, her fingers already busy at Ron��s sleeve, where the blood was 
wettest and darkest. 

Harry watched, horrified, as she tore open Ron��s short. He had always thought of Splinching as 
something comical, but this ... His insides crawled unpleasantly as Hermione laid bare Ron��s upper 
arm, where a great chunk of flesh was missing, scooped cleanly away as though by a knife. 

 ��Harry, quickly, in my bag, there��s a small bottle labeled 'Essence of Dittany'�C��

 ��Bag �C right �C��

��194ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry sped to the place where Hermione had landed, seized the tiny beaded bag, and thrust his 
hand inside it. At once, object after object began presenting itself to his touch, He felt the leather 
spines of books, woolly sleeves of jumpers, heels of shoes �C 

��Quickly!��

 He grabbed his wand from the ground and pointed it into the depths of the magical bag. 

��Accio Dittany!�� 

A small brown bottle zoomed out of the bag; he caught it and hastened back to Hermione and 
Ron, whose eyes were now half-closed, strips of white eyeball were all that were visible between 
his lids. 

��He��s fainted,�� said Hermione, who was also rather pale; she no longer looked like Mafalda, 
though her hair was still gray in places. ��Unstopper it for me, Harry, my hands are shaking.�� 

Harry wrenched the stopper off the little bottle. Hermione took it and poured three drops of the 
potion onto the bleeding wound. Greenish smoke billowed upward and when it had cleared, Harry 
saw that the bleeding had stopped. The wound now looked several days old; new skin stretched 
over what had just been open flesh. 

 ��Wow,�� said Harry. 

��It��s all I feel safe doing,�� said Hermione shakily. ��There are spells that would put him 
completely right, but I daren��t try in case I do them wrong and cause more damage... He��s lost so 
much blood already... �� 

��How did he get hurt? I mean�� �C Harry shook his head, trying to clear it, to make sense of 
whatever had just taken place �C ��why are we here? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld 
Place?��

 Hermione took a deep breath. She looked close to tears.

 ��Harry, I don��t think we��re going to be able to go back there.��

 ��What d��you �C?�� 

��As we Disapparated, Yaxley caught hold of me and I couldn��t get rid of him, he was too 
strong, and he was still holding on when we arrived at Grimmauld Place, and then �C well, I think 
he must have seen the door, and thought we were stopping there, so he slackened his grip and I 
managed to shake him off and I brought us here instead!�� 

��But then, where��s he? Hang on... You don��t mean he��s at Grimmauld Place? He can��t get in

��195ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

there?��

 Her eyes sparkled with unshed tears as she nodded. 

��Harry, I think he can. I �C I forced him to let go with a Revulsion Jinx, but I��d already taken 
him inside the Fidelius Charm��s protection. Since Dumbledore died, we��re Secret-Keepers, so I��ve 
given him the secret, haven��t I?�� 

There was no pretending; Harry was sure she was right. It was a serious blow. If Yaxley could 
now get inside the house, there was no way that they could return. Even now, he could be bringing 
other Death Eaters in there by Apparition. Gloomy and oppressive though the house was, it had 
been their one safe refuge; even, now that Kreacher was so much happier and friendlier, a kind of 
home. With a twinge of regret that had nothing to do with food, Harry imagined the house-elf 
busying himself over the steak-and-kidney pie that Harry, Ron, and Hermione would never eat.

 ��Harry, I��m sorry, I��m so sorry!��

 ��Don��t be stupid, it wasn��t your fault! If anything, it was mine... �� 

Harry put his hand in his pocket and drew out Mad-Eye��s eye. Hermione recoiled, looking 
horrified. 

��Umbridge had stuck it to her office door, to spy on people. I couldn��t leave it there ... but 
that��s how they knew there were intruders.�� 

Before Hermione could answer, Ron groaned and opened his eyes. He was still gray and his 
face glistened with sweat.

 ��How d��you feel?�� Hermione whispered. 

 ��Lousy,�� croaked Ron, wincing as he felt his injured arm. ��Where are we?�� 

��In the woods where they held the Quidditch World Cup,�� said Hermione. ��I wanted 
somewhere enclosed, undercover, and this was �C�� 

���C the first place you thought of,�� Harry finished for her, glancing around at the apparently 
deserted glade�ּ�յ� grassy clearing in forest). He could not help remembering what had 
happened the last time they had Apparated to the first place Hermione had thought of �C how Death 
Eaters had found them within minutes. Had it been Legilimency? Did Voldemort or his henchmen 
know, even now, where Hermione had taken them? 

��D��you reckon we should move on?�� Ron asked Harry, and Harry could tell by the look on 
Ron��s face that he was thinking the same.

��196ҳ��

��I dunno.�� 

Ron still looked pale and clammy. He had made no attempt to sit up and it looked as though he 
was too weak to do so. The prospect of moving him was daunting. 

��Let��s stay here for now,�� Harry said. 

 Looking relieved, Hermione sprang to her feet.

 ��Where are you going?�� asked Ron. 

��If we��re staying, we should put some protective enchantments around the place,�� she replied, 
and raising her wand, she began to walk in a wide circle around Harry and Ron, murmuring 
incantations as she went. Harry saw little disturbances in the surrounding air. It was as if Hermione 
had cast a heat haze upon their clearing. 

��Salvio Hexia ... Protego Totalum ... Repello Muggletum ... Muffliato ... You could get out the 

tent, Harry.��

 ��Tent?��

 ��In the bag!��

 ��In the ... of course,�� said Harry. 

He did not bother to grope inside it this time, but used another Summoning Charm. The tent 
emerged in a lumpy mass of canvas, ropes, and poles. Harry recognized it, partly because of the 
smell of cats, as the same tent in which they had slept on the night of the Quidditch World Cup. 

��I thought this belonged to that bloke Perkins at the Ministry?�� he asked, starting to disentangle 
the pent pegs. 

��Apparently he didn��t want it back, his lumbago's��ʹ so bad,�� said Hermione, now 
performing complicated figure-of-eight movements with her wand. ��so Ron��s dad said I could 
borrow it. Erecto!�� she added, pointing her wand at the misshapen canvas, which in one fluid 
motion rose into the air and settled, fully constructed, onto the ground before Harry, out of whose 
startled hands a tent peg soared, to land with a final thud at the end of a guy rope (���� a cable, 
wire, or rope that is used to brace something (especially a tent). 

��Cave Inimicum,�� Hermione finished with a skyward flourish. ��That��s as much as I can do. At 

the very least, we should know they��re coming; I can��t guarantee it will keep out Vol �C��

 ��Don��t say the name!�� Ron cut across her, his voice harsh. 

 Harry and Hermione looked at each other.

��I��m sorry,�� Ron said, moaning a little as he raised himself to look at them, ��but it feels like a �C 

a jinx or something. Can��t we call him You-Know-Who �C please?��

 ��Dumbledore said fear of a name �C�� began Harry. 

��In case you hadn��t noticed, mate, calling You-Know-Who by his name didn��t do Dumbledore 
much good in the end,�� Ron snapped back. ��Just �C just show You-Know-Who some respect, will 
you?�� 

��Respect?�� Harry repeated, but Hermione shot him a warning look; apparently he was not to 
argue with Ron while the latter was in such a weakened condition. 

Harry and Hermione half carried, half dragged Ron through the entrance of the tent. The 
interior was exactly as Harry remembered it; a small flat, complete with bathroom and tiny 
kitchen. He shoved aside an old armchair and lowered Ron carefully onto the lower berth of a 
bunk��ʽ���� bed. Even this very short journey had turned Ron whiter still, and once they had 
settled him on the mattress he closed his eyes again and did not speak for a while. 

��I��ll make some tea,�� said Hermione breathlessly, pulling kettle and mugs from the depths of 
her bag and heading toward the kitchen. 

Harry found the hot drink as welcome as the firewhisky had been on the night that Mad-Eye had 
died; it seemed to burn away a little of the fear fluttering in his chest. 

After a minute or two, Ron broke the silence. ��What d��you reckon happened to the 
Cattermoles?�� 

��With any luck, they��ll have got away,�� said Hermione, clutching her hot mug for comfort. ��As 
long as Mr. Cattermole had his wits about him, he��ll have transported Mrs. Cattermole by SideAlong-
Apparition and they��ll be fleeing the country right now with their children. That��s what 
Harry told her to do.�� 

��Blimey, I hope they escaped,�� said Ron, leaning back on his pillows. The tea seemed to be 
doing him good; a little of his color had returned. ��I didn��t get the feeling Reg Cattermole was all 
that quick-witted, though, the way everyone was talking to me when I was him. God, I hope they 
made it... If they both end up in Azkaban because of us ...�� 

Harry looked over at Hermione and the question he had been about to ask �C about whether Mrs. 
Cattermole��s lack of a wand would prevent her Apparating alongside her husband �C died in his 
throat. Hermione was watching Ron fret over the fate of the Cattermoles, and there was such

��198ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

tenderness in her expression that Harry felt almost as if he had surprised her in the act of kissing 

him.

 ��So, have you got it?�� Harry asked her, partly to remind her that he was there.

 ��Got �C got what?�� she said with a little start.

 ��What did we just go through all that for? The locket! Where��s the locket?�� 

��You got it?�� shouted Ron, raising himself a little higher on his pillows. ��No one tells me 
anything! Blimey, you could have mentioned it!�� 

��Well, we were running for our lives from the Death Eaters, weren��t we?�� said Hermione. 
��Here.��

 And she pulled the locket out of the pocket of her robes and handed it to Ron. 

It was as large as a chicken��s egg. An ornate letter S, inlaid with many small green stones, 
glinted dully in the diffused light shining through the tent��s canvas roof. 

��There isn��t any chance someone��s destroyed it since Kreacher had it?�� asked Ron hopefully. ��I 
mean, are we sure it��s still a Horcrux?��

 ��I think so,�� said Hermione, taking it back from him and looking at it closely. ��There��d be some 
sign of damage if it had been magically destroyed.�� 

She passed it to Harry, who turned it over in his fingers. The thing looked perfect, pristine. He 
remembered the mangled remains of the diary, and how the stone in the Horcrux ring had been 
cracked open when Dumbledore destroyed it. 

��I reckon Kreacher��s right,�� said Harry. ��We��re going to have to work out how to open this 
thing before we can destroy it.�� 

Sudden awareness of what he was holding, of what lived behind the little golden doors, hit 
Harry as he spoke. Even after all their efforts to find it, he felt a violent urge to fling the locket 
from him. Mastering himself again, he tried to prise the locket apart with his fingers, then 
attempted the charm Hermione had used to open Regulus��s bedroom door. Neither worked. He 
handed the locket back to Ron and Hermione, each of whom did their best, but were no more 
successful at opening it than he had been. 

��Can you feel it, though?�� Ron asked in a hushed voice, as he held it tight in his clenched fist. 

��What d��you mean?�� 

Ron passed the Horcrux to Harry.

��199ҳ��

After a moment or two, Harry thought he knew what Ron meant. Was it his own blood pulsing 
through his veins that he could feel, or was it something beating inside the locket, like a tiny metal 
heart?

 ��What are we going to do with it?�� Hermione asked. 

��Keep it safe till we work out how to destroy it.�� Harry replied, and, little though he wanted to, 
he hung the chain around his own neck, dropping the locket out of sight beneath his robes, where it 
rested against his chest beside the pouch Hagrid had given him. 

��I think we should take it in turns to keep watch outside the tent,�� he added to Hermione, 
standing up and stretching. ��And we��ll need to think about some food as well. You stay there,�� he 
added sharply, as Ron attempted to sit up and turned a nasty shade of green.

 With the Sneakoscope Hermione had given Harry for his birthday set carefully upon the table in 
the tent, Harry and Hermione spent the rest of the day sharing the role of lookout. However, the 
Sneakoscope remained silent and still upon its point all day, and whether because of the protective 
enchantments and Muggle-repelling charms Hermione had spread around them, or because people 
rarely ventured this way, their patch of wood remained deserted, apart from occasional birds and 
squirrels. Evening brought no change; Harry lit his wand as he swapped places with Hermione at 
ten o��clock, and looked out upon a deserted scene, noting the bats fluttering high above him across 
the single patch of starry sky visible from their protected clearing. 

He felt hungry now, and a little light-headed. Hermione had not packed any food in her magical 
bag, as she had assumed that they would be returning to Grimmauld Place that night, so they had 
had nothing to eat except some wild mushrooms that Hermione had collected from amongst the 
nearest trees and stewed in a Billycan. After a couple of mouthfuls Ron had pushed his portion 
away, looking queasy; Harry had only persevered so as to not hurt Hermione��s feelings. 

The surrounding silence was broken by odd rustlings and what sounded like crackings of twigs, 
Harry thought that they were caused by animals rather than people, yet he kept his wand held tight 
at the ready. His insides, already uncomfortable due to their inadequate helping of rubbery 
mushrooms, tingled with unease. 

He had thought that he would feel elated if they managed to steal back the Horcrux, but 
somehow he did not; all he felt as he sat looking out at the darkness, of which his wand lit only a 
tiny part, was worry about what would happen next. It was as though he had been hurtling toward

��200ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

this point for weeks, months, maybe even years, but now he had come to an abrupt halt, run out of 
road. 

There were other Horcruxes out there somewhere, but he did not have the faintest idea where 
they could be. He did not even know what all of them were. Meanwhile he was at a loss to know 
how to destroy the only one that they had found, the Horcrux that currently lay against the bare 
flesh of his chest. Curiously, it had not taken heat from his body, but lay so cold against his skin it 
might just have emerged from icy water. From time to time Harry thought, or perhaps imagined, 
that he could feel the tiny heartbeat ticking irregularly alongside his own. Nameless forebodings 
crept upon him as he sat there in the dark. He tried to resist them, push them away, yet they came 
at him relentlessly. Neither can live while the other survives. Ron and Hermione, now talking 
softly behind him in the tent, could walk away if they wanted to. He could not. And it seemed to 
Harry as he sat there trying to master his own fear and exhaustion, that the Horcrux against his 
chest was ticking away the time he had left... Stupid idea, he told himself, don��t think that... 

His scar was starting to prickle again. He was afraid that he was making it happen by having 
these thoughts, and tried to direct them into another channel. He thought of poor Kreacher, who 
had expected them home and had received Yaxley instead. Would the elf keep silent or would he 
tell the Death Eater everything he knew? Harry wanted to believe that Kreacher had changed 
towards him in the past month, that he would be loyal now, but who knew what would happen? 
What if the Death Eaters tortured the elf? Sick images swarmed into Harry��s head and he tried to 
push these away too, for there was nothing he could do for Kreacher. He and Hermione had 
already decided against trying to summon him; what if someone from the Ministry came too? They 
could not count on elfish Apparition being free from the same flaw that had taken Yaxley to 
Grimmauld Place on the hem of Hermione��s sleeve. 

Harry��s scar was burning now. He thought that there was so much they did not know, Lupin 
had been right about magic they had never encountered or imagined. Why hadn��t Dumbledore 
explained more? Had he thought that there would be time; that he would live for years, for 
centuries perhaps, like his friend Nicolas Flamel? If so, he had been wrong. Snape had seen to 
that... Snape, the sleeping snake, who had struck at the top of the tower ... 

 And Dumbledore had fallen ... fallen ...

��Give it to me, Gregorovitch.�� 

Harry��s voice was high, clear, and cold, his wand held in front of him by a long-fingered white 
hand. The man at whom he was pointing was suspended upside down in midair, though there were 
no ropes holding him; he swung there, invisibly and eerily bound, his limbs wrapped about him, 
his terrified face, on a level with Harry��s, ruddy due to the blood that had rushed to his head. He 
had pure-white hair and a thick, bushy beard, a trussed��, ��-up Father Christmas.

 ��I have it not, I have it no more! It was, many years ago, stolen from me!��

 ��Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Gregorovitch. He knows... He always knows.�� 

The hanging man��s pupils were wide, dilated with fear, and they seemed to swell, bigger and 
bigger until their blackness swallowed Harry whole �C 

And now Harry was hurrying along a dark corridor in stout little Gregorovitch��s wake as he 
held a lantern aloft, Gregorovitch burst into the room at the end of the passage and his lantern 
illuminated what looked like a workshop; wood shavings and gold gleamed in the swinging pool of 
light, and there on the window ledge sat perched, like a giant bird, a young man with golden hair. 
In the split second that the lantern��s light illuminated him, Harry saw the delight upon his 
handsome face, then the intruder shot a Stunning Spell from his wand and jumped neatly backward 
out of the window with a crow of laughter. 

And Harry was hurtling back out of those wide, tunnellike pupils and Gregorovitch��s face was 

stricken with terror.

 ��Who was the thief, Gregorovitch?�� said the high cold voice.

 ��I do not know, I never knew, a young man �C no �C please �C PLEASE!��

 A scream that went on and on and then a burst of green light - 

��Harry!�� 

He opened his eyes, panting, his forehead throbbing. He had passed out against the side of the 
tent, had slid sideways down the canvas, and was sprawled on the ground. He looked up at 
Hermione, whose bushy hair obscured the tiny patch of sky visible through the dark branches high 
above them. 

��Dream,�� he said, sitting up quickly and attempting to meet Hermione��s glower with a look of 
innocence. ��Must��ve dozed off, sorry.��

 ��I know it was your scar! I can tell by the look on your face! You were looking into Vol �C��

��Don��t say his name!�� came Ron��s angry voice from the depths of the tent.

 ��Fine,�� retorted Hermione, ��You-Know-Who��s mind, then!�� 

��I didn��t mean it to happen!�� Harry said. ��It was a dream! Can you control what you dream 
about, Hermione?��

 ��If you just learned to apply Occlumency �C��

 But Harry was not interested in being told off; he wanted to discuss what he had just seen. 

��He��s found Gregorovitch, Hermione, and I think he��s killed him, but before he killed him he 
read Gregorovitch��s mind and I saw �C�� 

��I think I��d better take over the watch if you��re so tired you��re falling sleep,�� said Hermione 
coldly.

 ��I can finish the watch!��

 ��No, you��re obviously exhausted. Go and lie down.�� 

She dropped down in the mouth of the tent, looking stubborn. Angry, but wishing to avoid a 

row, Harry ducked back inside. 

Ron��s still-pale face was poking out from the lower bunk; Harry climbed into the one above 
him, lay down, and looked up at the dark canvas ceiling. After several moments, Ron spoke in a 
voice so low that it would not carry to Hermione, huddled in the entrance.

 ��What��s You-Know-Who doing?�� 

Harry screwed up his eyes in the effort to remember every detail, then whispered into the 
darkness. 

 ��He found Gregorovitch. He had him tied up, he was torturing him.�� 

��How��s Gregorovitch supposed to make him a new wand if he��s tied up?��

 ��I dunno... It��s weird, isn��t it?�� 

Harry closed his eyes, thinking of all that he had seen and heard. The more he recalled, the less 
sense it made... Voldemort had said nothing about Harry��s wand, nothing about the twin cores, 
nothing about Gregorovitch making a new and more powerful wand to beat Harry��s.

 ��He wanted something from Gregorovitch,�� Harry said, eyes still closed tight. ��He asked him to 
hand it over, but Gregorovitch said it had been stolen from him ... and then ... then ...�� 

He remembered how he, as Voldemort, had seemed to hurtle through Gregorovitch��s eyes, into 
his memories.

��203ҳ��

��He read Gregorovitch��s mind, and I saw this young bloke perched on a windowsill, and he 
fired a curse at Gregorovitch and jumped out of sight. He stole it, he stole whatever You-KnowWho��s 
after. And I ... I think I��ve seen him somewhere... ��

 Harry wished he could have another glimpse of the laughing boy��s face. The theft had happened 
many years ago, according to Gregorovitch. Why did the young thief look familiar? 

The noises of the surrounding woods were muffled inside the tent; all Harry could hear was 
Ron��s breathing. After a while, Ron whispered, ��Couldn��t you see what the thief was holding?��

 ��No ... it must��ve been something small.��

 ��Harry?��

 The wooden slats of Ron��s bunk creaked as he repositioned himself in bed. 

 ��Harry, you don��t reckon You-Know-Who��s after something else to turn into a Horcrux?�� 

��I don��t know,�� said Harry slowly. ��Maybe. But wouldn��t it be dangerous for him to make 

another one? Didn��t Hermione say he had pushed his soul to the limit already?��

 ��Yeah, but maybe he doesn��t know that.��

 ��Yeah ... maybe,�� said Harry. 

He had been sure that Voldemort had been looking for a way around the problem of the twin 
cores, sure that Voldemort sought a solution from the old wandmaker ... and yet he had killed him, 
apparently without asking him a single question about wandlore. 

What was Voldemort trying to find? Why, with the Ministry of Magic and the Wizarding world 
at his feet, was he far away, intent on the pursuit of an object that Gregorovitch had once owned, 
and which had been stolen by the unknown thief? 

Harry could still see the blond-haired youth��s face; it was merry, wild; there was a Fred and 
George-ish air of triumphant trickery about him. He had soared from the windowsill like a bird, 
and Harry had seen him before, but he could not think where. 

With Gregorovitch dead, it was the merry-faced thief who was in danger now, and it was on 
him that Harry��s thoughts dwelled, as Ron��s snores began to rumble from the lower bunk and as he 
himself drifted slowly into sleep once more.

Chapter Fifteen 
The Goblin��s Revenge 


Early next morning, before the other two were 
left the tent to search the woods around them for 
gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. 
shadows he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and 
by gouging a small cross in the bark with his 
not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would

awake, Harry 
the oldest, most 
There in its

wand. It was 
have much 
Umbridge's 

door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going 
to do next. 

Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with 
the sole provison that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione 
therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron 
obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. 
Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town. 

Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copseС��ľ�� of trees and surrounded 
it with freshly cast defensive enchantments. Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find 
sustenance (food). This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an 
unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he 
stood. 

"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent 
empty handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors. 

 "I couldn't ... make one." he panted, clutching the stitch in his side. "Wouldn't ... come." 

Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a 
nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, 
as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he was not 
going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry's willpower to uproot himself from the 
spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went. 

 "So we still haven't got any food." 

"Shut up, Ron," snapped Hermione. "Harry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn't 

make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!"

 "I don't know." 

He sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was 
afraid that something had gone wrong inside him. Yesterday seemed a long time ago. Today he 
might have been thirteen years old again, the only one who collapsed on the Hogwarts Express. 

Ron kicked a chair leg. "What?" he snarled at Hermione. "I'm starving! All I've had since I bled 
half to death is a couple of toadstools!"

 "You go and fight your way through the dementors, then," said Harry, stung. 

 "I would, but my arm's in a sling, in case you hadn't noticed!"

 "That's convenient."

 "And what's that supposed to -?" 

"Of course!" cried Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into 
silence. "Harry, give me the locket! Come on," she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him 
when he did not react, "the Horcrux, Harry, you're still wearing it!" 

She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The moment it parted 
contact with Harry's skin he felt free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy 
or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted.

 "Better?" asked Hermione.

 "Yeah, loads better!" 

"Harry," she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated 
with visiting the very sick, "you don't think you've been possessed, do you?" 

"What? No!" he said defensively, "I remember everything we've done while I've bee wearing it. 
I wouldn't know what I'd done if I'd been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times 
when she couldn't remember anything." 

"Hmm," said Hermione, looking down at the heavy locket. "Well, maybe we ought not to wear 
it. We can just keep it in the tent." 

"We are not leaving that Horcrux lying around," Harry stated firmly. "If we lose it, if it gets

��206ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

stolen -" 

 "Oh, all right, all right," said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out 
of sight down the front of her shirt. "But we'll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too 
long."

 "Great," said Ron irritably, "and now we've sorted that out, can we please get some food?" 

"Fine, but we'll go somewhere else to find it," said Hermione with half a glance at Harry. 
"There's no point staying where we know dementors are swooping around." 

In the end they settled down for the night in a far-flung�㲼�� (spread over a large area) field 
belonging to a lonely farm, from which they had managed to obtain eggs and bread. 

"It's not stealing, is it?" asked Hermione in a troubled voice, as they devoured scrambled eggs 
on toast. "Not if I left some money under the chicken coop?"

 Ron rolled his eyes and said, with his cheeks bulging, "Er-my-nee, 'oo worry 'oo much. 'Elax!" 

And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed. The argument 
about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as 
he took the first of the three night watches. 

This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits, an empty one, 
bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near 
starvation at the Dursleys��. Hermione bore up���� 
reasonably well on those nights when they 
managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than 
usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a 
day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both 
unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron's turn to wear the Horcrux, 
he became downright unpleasant. 

"So where next?" was his constant refrain��ͷ�� 
. He did not seem to have any ideas himself, 
but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded (sulk) over the 
low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where 
they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they already got, their 
conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they got no new information. 

As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places 
important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that

��207ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised; Hogwarts, 
where he had been educated; Borgin and Burks, where he had worked after completing school; 
then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile. These formed the basis of their speculations. 

"Yeah, let's go to Albania. Shouldn't take more than an afternoon to search an entire country," 
said Ron sarcastically. 

"There can't be anything there. He'd already made five of his Horcruxes before he went into 
exile, and Dumbledore was certain the snake is the sixth," said Hermione. "We know the snake's 
not in Albania, it's usually with Vol��"

 "Didn't I ask you to stop say that?"

 "Fine! The snake is usually with You-Know-Who, happy?"

 "Not particularly." 

"I can't see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes." said Harry, who had made this point 
many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. "Borgin and Burke were 
experts at Dark objects, they would've recognized a Horcrux straightaway." 

Ron yawned pointedly. Repressing a strong urge to throw something at him, Harry plowed on, 
"I still reckon he might have hidden something at Hogwarts." 

 Hermione sighed. "But Dumbledore would have found it, Harry!"

 Harry repeated the argument he kept bringing out in favor of this theory. 

"Dumbledore said in front of me that he never assumed he knew all of Hogwart's secrets. I'm 

telling you, if there was one place Vol��" 

 "Oi!" 

"YOU-KNOW-WHO, then!" Harry shouted, goaded past endurance. "If there was one place 

that was really important to You-Know-Who, it was Hogwarts!" 

 "Oh, come on," scoffed Ron. "His school?" 

"Yeah, his school! It was his first real home, the place that meant he was special, it meant 
everything to him, and even after he left -" 

 "This is You-Know-Who we're talking about, right? Not you?" inquired Ron. He was tugging at 
the chain of the Horcrux around his neck; Harry was visited by a desire to seize it and throttle him. 

"You told us that You-Know-Who asked Dumbledore to give him a job after he left," said 
Hermione.

��208ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"That's right," said Harry. 

"And Dumbledore thought he only wanted to come back to try and find something, probably 
another founder's object, to make into another Horcrux?" 

 ��Yeah,�� said Harry. 

��But he didn��t get the job, did he?�� said Hermione. ��So he never got the chance to find a 

founder��s object there and hide it in the school!��

 ��Okay, then,�� said Harry, defeated. ��Forget Hogwarts.�� 

Without any other leads, they traveled into London and, hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, 
search for the orphanage in which Voldemort had been raised. Hermione stole into a library and 
discovered from their records that the place had been demolished many years before. They visited 
its site and found a tower block of offices. 

 ��We could try digging in to foundations?�� Hermione suggested halfheartedly. 

��He wouldn��t have hidden a Horcrux here,�� Harry said. He had known it all along. The 
orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have 
hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or 
mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could 
imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding banks, with its 
gilded doors and marble floors. 

Even without any new idea, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent 
in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed 
all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by 
Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered 
mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly coveС���� 
. Every twelve hours or so they passed 
the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of passthe-
parcel, where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of 
increased fear and anxiety. 

Harry��s scare kept prickling. It happened most often, he noticed, when he was wearing the 

Horcrux. Sometimes he could not stop himself reacting to the pain. 

 ��What? What did you see?�� demanded Ron, whenever he noticed Harry wince. 

 ��A face,�� muttered Harry, every time. ��The same face. The thief who stole from Gregorovitch.��

And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron 
was hoping to hear news of his family or the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, 
Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not 
tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown 
youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no 
better than he did. As Harry��s scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam 
tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other 
two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, 
when they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes. 

As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having 
conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry 
entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads 
together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them 
and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water. 

Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a 
pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn 
in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that 
Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further 
Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of 
the others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it. 

Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it. They were now pitching the tent 
on mulches (spread leaves or straw around plants) of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast 
by the dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles. The fact that Hermione was getting better 
at identifying edible fungi could not altogether compensate for their continuing isolation, the lack 
of other people��s company, or their total ignorance of what was going on in the war against 
Voldemort. 

��My mother,�� said Ron on night, as they sat in the tent on a riverbank in Wales, ��can make 
good food appear out of thin air.��

He prodded moodily at the lumps of charred gray fish on his plate. Harry glanced automatically 
at Ron��s neck and saw, as he has expected, the golden chain of the Horcrux glinting there. He 
managed to fight down the impulse to swear at Ron, whose attitude would, he knew, improve 
slightly when the time came to take off the locket. 

��Your mother can��t produce food out of thin air,�� said Hermione. ��No one can. Food is the first 

of the five Principal Exceptions to Gamp��s Law of Elemental Transfigura -��

 ��Oh, speak English, can��t you?�� Ron said, prising a fish out from between his teeth. 

��It��s impossible to make good food out of nothing! You can Summon it if you know where it is, 

you can transform it, you can increase the quantity if you��ve already got some -��

 ��Well, don��t bother increasing this, it��s disgusting,�� said Ron. 

��Harry caught the fish and I did my best with it! I notice I��m always the one who ends up 

sorting out the food, because I��m a girl, I suppose!��

 ��No, it��s because you��re supposed to be the best at magic!�� shot back Ron. 

 Hermione jumped up and bits of roast pike���ƹ������ 
slid off her tin plate onto the floor. 

��You can do the cooking tomorrow, Ron, you can find the ingredients and try and charm them 

into something worth eating, and I��ll sit here and pull faces and moan and you can see you -��

 ��Shut up!�� said Harry, leaping to his feet and holding up both hands. ��Shut up now!��

 Hermione looked outraged. ��How can you side with him, he hardly ever does the cook -��

 ��Hermione, be quiet, I can hear someone!�� 

He was listening hard, his hands still raised, warning them not to talk. Then, over the rush and 

gush of the dark river beside them, he heard voices again. He looked around at the Sneakoscope. It 

was not moving.

 ��You cast the Muffliato charm over us, right?�� he whispered to Hermione. 

��I did everything,�� she whispered back, ��Muffliato, Muggle-Repelling and Disillusionment 

Charms, all of it. They shouldn��t be able to hear or see us, whoever they are.�� 

Heavy scuffing and scraping noises, plus the sound of dislodged stones and twigs, told them 
that several people were clambering down the steep, wooded slope that descended to the narrow 
bank where they had pitched the tent. They drew their wands, waiting. The enchantments they had 
cast around themselves ought to be sufficient, in the near total darkness, to shield them from the 
notice of Muggles and normal witches and wizards. If these were Death Eaters, then perhaps their

��211ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

defenses were about to be tested by Dark Magic for the first time. 

The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Harry 
estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it 
impossible to tell for sure. Hermione snatched up the beaded bag and started to rummage; after a 
moment she drew out three Extendible Ears and threw one each to Harry and Ron, who hastily 
inserted the ends of the flesh-colored strings into their ears and fed the other ends out of the tent 
entrance.

 Within seconds Harry heard a weary male voice. 

��There ought to be a few salmon in here, or d��you reckon it��s too early in the season? Accio 
Salmon!�� 

There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. 
Somebody grunted appreciatively. 

Harry pressed the Extendable ear deeper into his own. Over the murmur of the river he could 
make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever 
heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there 
seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other. 

A fire danced into life on the other side of the canvas, large shadows passed between tent and 
flames. The delicious smell of baking salmon wafted tantalizingly in their direction. Then came the 
clinking of cutlery on plates, and the first man spoke again.

 ��Here, Griphook, Gornuk.��

 Goblins! Hermione mouthed at Harry, who nodded. 

 ��Thank you,�� said the goblins together in English. 

��So, you three have been on the run how long?�� asked a new, mellow, and pleasant voice; it 
was vaguely familiar to Harry, who pictured a round-bellied, cheerful-faced man. 

��Six weeks ... Seven ... I forget,�� said the tired man. ��Met up with Griphook in the first couple 
of days and joined forces with Gornuk not long after. Nice to have a bit of company.�� There was a 
pause, while knives scraped plates and tin mugs were picked up and replaced on the ground. 
��What made you leave, Ted?�� continued the man. 

��Knew they were coming for me,�� replied mellow-voiced Ted, and Harry suddenly knew who 
he was, Tonks��s father. ��Heard Death Eaters were in the area last week and decided I��d better run

for it. Refused to register as a Muggle-born on principle, see, so I knew it was a matter of time, 
knew I��d have to leave in the end. My wife should be okay, she��s pure-blood. And then I met Dean 
here, what, a few days ago, son?�� 

��Yeah,�� said another voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione stared at each other, silent but 
besides themselves with excitement, sure they recognized the voice of Dean Thomas, their fellow 
Gryffindor.

 ��Muggle-born, eh?�� asked the first man. 

��Not sure,�� said Dean. ��My dad left my mum when I was a kid. I��ve got no proof he was a 
wizard, though.��

 There was silence for a while, except for the sounds of munching, then Ted spoke again. 

��I��ve got to say, Dirk, I��m surprised to run into you. Pleased, but surprised. Word was that 

you��d been caught.�� 

��I was,�� said Dirk. ��I was halfway to Azkaban when I made a break for it. Stunned Dawlish, 
and nicked his broom. It was easier than you��d think; I don��t reckon he��s quite right at the moment. 
Might be Confunded. If so, I��d like to shake the hand of the witch or wizard who did it, probably 
saved my life.�� 

There was another pause in which the fire crackled and the river rushed on. The Ted said, ��And 
where do you two fit in? I, er, had the impression the goblins were for You-Know-Who, on the 
whole.�� 

��You had a false impression,�� said the higher-voiced of the goblins. ��We take no sides. This is 

a wizards�� war.��

 ��How come you��re in hiding, then?�� 

��I deemed it prudent,�� said the deeper-voiced goblin. ��Having refused what I considered an 

impertinent request, I could see that my personal safety was in jeopardy.��

 ��What did they ask you to do?�� asked Ted. 

��Duties ill-befitting the dignity of my race,�� replied the goblin, his voice rougher and less 

human as he said it. ��I am not a house-elf.��

 ��What about you, Griphook?�� 

��Similar reasons,�� said the higher voiced goblin. ��Gringotts is no longer under the sole control 

of my race. I recognize no Wizarding master.��

��213ҳ��

He added something under his breath in Gobbledegook, and Gornuk laughed.

 ��What��s the joke?�� asked Dean. 

 ��He said,�� replied Dirk, ��that there are things wizards don��t recognize, either.��

 There was a short pause. 

 ��I don��t get it,�� said Dean.

 ��I had my small revenge before I left,�� said Griphook in English. 

��Good man -goblin, I should say,�� amended Ted hastily. ��Didn��t manage to lock a Death Eater 
up in one of the old high-security vaults, I suppose?�� 

��If I had, the sword would not have helped him break out,�� replied Griphook. Gornuk laughed 

again and even Dirk gave a dry chuckle.

 ��Dean and I are still missing something here,�� said Ted. 

��So is Severus Snape, though he does not know it,�� said Griphook, and the two goblins roared 
with malicious laughter. Inside the tent Harry��s breathing was shallow with excitement, He and 
Hermione stared at each other, listening as hard as they could. 

��Didn��t you hear about that, Ted?�� asked Dirk. ��About the kids who tried to steal Gryffindor��s 
sword out of Snape��s office at Hogwarts?�� 

An electric current seemed to course through Harry, jangling his every nerve as he stood rooted 
to the spot. 

 ��Never heard a word,�� said Ted, ��Not in the Prophet, was it?�� 

��Hardly,�� chortled Dirk. ��Griphook here told me, he heard about it from Bill Weasley who 
works for the bank. One of the kids who tried to take the sword was Bill��s younger sister.�� 

Harry glanced toward Hermione and Ron, both of whom were clutching the Extendable Ears as 
tightly as lifelines. 

��She and a couple of friends got into Snape��s office and smashed open the glass case where he 
was apparently keeping the sword. Snape caught them as they were trying to smuggle it down the 
staircase.�� 

��Ah, God bless 'em,�� said Ted. ��What did they think, that they��d be able to use the sword on 
You-Know-Who? Or on Snape himself? 

��Well, whatever they thought they were going to do with it, Snape decided the sword wasn��t 
safe where it was,�� said Dirk. ��Couple of days later, once he��d got the say-so (approval) from You


��214ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Know-Who, I imagine, he sent it down to London to be kept in Gringotts instead.��

 The goblins started to laugh again.

 ��I��m still not seeing the joke,�� said Ted.

 ��It��s a fake,�� rasped Griphook.

 ��The sword of Gryffindor!�� 

��Oh yes. It is a copy -an excellent copy, it is true -but it was Wizard-made. The original was 

forged centuries ago by goblins and had certain properties only goblin-made armor possesses. 

Wherever the genuine sword of Gryffindor is, it is not in a vault at Gringotts bank.��

 ��I see,�� said Ted. ��And I take it you didn��t bother telling the Death Eaters this?�� 

��I saw no reason to trouble them with the information,�� said Griphook smugly, and now Ted 

and Dean joined in Gornuk and Dirk��s laughter. 

Inside the tent, Harry closed his eyes, willing someone to ask the question he needed answered, 
and after a minute that seemed ten, Dean obliged, he was (Harry remembered with a jolt) an ex-
boyfriend of Ginny��s too.

 ��What happened to Ginny and all the others? The ones who tried to steal it?��

 ��Oh, they were punished, and cruelly,�� said Griphook indifferently. 

��They��re okay, though?�� asked Ted quickly, ��I mean, the Weasleys don��t need any more of 
their kids injured, do they?��

 ��They suffered no serious injury, as far as I am aware,�� said Griphook. 

��Lucky for them,�� said Ted. ��With Snape��s track record I suppose we should just be glad 
they��re still alive.�� 

��You believe that story, then, do you, Ted?�� asked Dirk.�� You believe Snape killed 
Dumbledore? 

��'Course I do,�� said Ted. ��You��re not going to sit there and tell me you think Potter had 
anything to do with it?��

 ��Hard to know what to believe these days,�� muttered Dirk. 

��I know Harry Potter,�� said Dean. ��And I reckon he��s the real thing -the Chosen One, or 
whatever you want to call it.�� 

��Yeah, there��s a lot would like to believe he��s that, son,�� said Dirk, ��me included. But where is 
he? Run for it, by the looks of things. You��d think if he knew anything we don��t, or had anything

special going for him, he��d be out there now fighting, rallying resistance, instead of hiding. And 
you know, the Prophet made a pretty good case against him -�� 

��The Prophet?�� scoffed Ted. ��You deserve to be lied to if you��re still reading that much, Dirk. 
You want the facts, try the Quibbler.�� 

There was a sudden explosion of choking and retching, plus a good deal of thumping, by the 
sound of it. Dirk had swallowed a fish bone. At last he sputtered, ��The Quibbler? That lunatic rag 
of Xeno Lovegood��s?�� 

��It��s not so lunatic these days,�� said Ted. ��You want to give it a look, Xeno is printing all the 
stuff the Prophet��s ignoring, not a single mention of Crumple-Horned Snorkacks in the last issue. 
How long they��ll let him get with it, mind, I don��t know. But Xeno says, front page of every issue, 
that any wizard who��s against You-Know-Who ought to make helping Harry Potter their number-
one priority.��

 ��Hard to help a boy who��s vanished off the face of the earth,�� said Dirk. 

��Listen, the fact that they haven��t caught him yet��s one hell of an achievement,�� said Ted. ��I��d 
take tips from him gladly; it��s what we��re trying to do, stay free, isn��t it?�� 

��Yeah, well, you��ve got a point there,�� said Dirk heavily. ��With the whole of the Ministry and 
all their informers looking for him, I��d have expected him to be caught by now. Mind, who��s to say 
they haven��t already caught and killed him without publicizing it?��

 ��Ah, don��t say that, Dirk,�� murmured Ted. 

There was a long pause filled with more clattering of knives and forks. When they spoke again 
it was to discuss whether they ought to sleep on the bank or retreat back up the wooded slope. 
Deciding the trees would give better cover, they extinguished their fire, then clambered back up 
the incline, their voices fading away. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione reeled in the Extendable Ears. Harry, who had found the need to 
remain silent increasingly difficult the longer they eavesdropped, now found himself unable to say 
more then, ��Ginny - the sword -��

 ��I know!�� said Hermione.

 She lunged for the tiny beaded bag, this time sinking her arm in it right up to the armpit. 

��Here ... we ... are ...�� she said between gritted teeth, and she pulled at something that was 
evidently in the depths of the bag. Slowly the edge of an ornate picture frame came into sight.

��216ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry hurried to help her. As they lifted the empty portrait of Phineas Nigellus free of Hermione��s 
bag, she kept her wand pointing at it, ready to cast a spell at any moment. 

��If somebody swapped the real sword for the fake while it was in Dumbledore��s office,�� she 
panted, as they propped the painting against the side of the tent, ��Phineas Nigellus would have 
seen it happen, he hangs right beside the case!�� 

��Unless he was asleep,�� said Harry, but he still held his breath as Hermione knelt down in front 

of the empty canvas, her wand directed at its center, cleared her throat, then said, 

 ��Er��Phineas? Phineas Nigellus?��

 Nothing happened. 

��Phineas Nigellus?�� said Hermione again. ��Professor Black? Please could we talk to you? 

Please?��

 ��'Please' always helps,�� said a cold, snide voice, and Phineas Nigellus slid into his portrait. 

At once, Hermione cried, ��Obscura!�� 

A black blindfold appeared over Phineas Nigellus��s clever, dark eyes, causing him to bump into 

the frame and shriek with pain. 

 ��What - how dare - what are you -?��

 ��I��m very sorry, Professor Black,�� said Hermione, ��but it��s a necessary precaution!�� 

��Remove this foul addition at once! Remove it, I say! You are ruining a great work of art! 
Where am I? What is going on?�� 

��Never mind where we are,�� said Harry, and Phineas Nigellus froze, abandoning his attempts to 
peel off the painted blindfold.

 ��Can that possible be the voice of the elusive Mr. Potter?�� 

��Maybe,�� said Harry, knowing that this would keep Phineas Nigellus��s interest. ��We��ve got a 
couple of questions to ask you - about the sword of Gryffindor.�� 

��Ah,�� said Phineas Nigellus, now turning his head this way and that in an effort to catch sight 
of Harry, ��yes. That silly girl acted most unwisely there -��

 ��Shut up about my sister,�� said Ron roughly, Phineas Nigellus raised supercilious eyebrows.

 ��Who else is here?�� he asked, turning his head from side to side. ��Your tone displeases me! The 
girl and her friends were foolhardily in the extreme. Thieving from the headmaster.��

 ��They weren��t thieving,�� said Harry. ��That sword isn��t Snape��s.��

��217ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It belongs to Professor Snape��s school,�� said Phineas Nigellus. ��Exactly what claim did the 
Weasley girl have upon it? She deserved her punishment, as did the idiot Longbottom and the 
Lovegood oddity!��

 ��Neville is not an idiot and Luna is not an oddity!�� said Hermione. 

��Where am I?�� repeated Phineas Nigellus, starting to wrestle with the blindfold again. ��Where 
have you brought me? Why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?��

 ��Never mind that! How did Snape punish Ginny, Neville, and Luna?�� asked Harry urgently.

 ��Professor Snape sent them into the Forbidden Forest, to do some work for the oaf, Hagrid.��

 ��Hagrid��s not an oaf!�� said Hermione shrilly. 

��And Snape might��ve though that was a punishment,�� said Harry, ��buy Ginny, Neville, and 

Luna probably had a good laugh with Hagrid. The Forbidden Forest ... they��ve faced plenty worse 

than the Forbidden Forest, big deal!��

 He felt relieved; he had been imagining horrors, the Cruciatus Curse at the very least. 

��What we really wanted to know, Professor Black, is whether anyone else has, um, taken out 

the sword at all? Maybe it��s been taken away for cleaning... or something!��

 Phineas Nigellus paused again in his struggles to free his eyes and sniggered. 

��Muggle-born,�� he said, ��Goblin-made armor does not require cleaning, simple girl. Goblin��s 

silver repels mundane dirt, imbibing only that which strengthens it.��

 ��Don��t call Hermione simple,�� said Harry. 

��I grow weary of contradiction,�� said Phineas Nigellus. ��Perhaps it is time for me to return to 
the headmaster��s office.��

 Still blindfolded, he began groping the side of his frame, trying to feel his way out of his picture 
and back into the one at Hogwarts. Harry had a sudden inspiration.

 ��Dumbledore! Can��t you bring us Dumbledore?��

 ��I beg your pardon?�� asked Phineas Nigellus. 

 ��Professor Dumbledore��s portrait��couldn��t you bring him along, here, into yours?��

 Phineas Nigellus turned his face in the direction of Harry��s voice. 

��Evidently it is not only Muggle-borns who are ignorant, Potter. The portraits of Hogwarts may 
commune with each other, but they cannot travel outside of the castle except to visit a painting of 
themselves elsewhere. Dumbledore cannot come here with me, and after the treatment I have

��218ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

received at your hands, I can assure you that I will not be making a return visit!��

 Slightly crestfallen, Harry watched Phineas redouble his attempts to leave his frame. 

��Professor Black,�� said Hermione, ��couldn��t you just tell us, please, when was the last time the 

sword was taken out of its case? Before Ginny took it out, I mean?��

 Phineas snorted impatiently. 

��I believe that the last time I saw the sword of Gryffindor leave its case was when Professor 
Dumbledore used it to break open a ring.�� 

Hermione whipped around to look at Harry. Neither of them dared say more in front of Phineas 
Nigellus, who had at last managed to locate the exit. 

��Well, good night to you,�� he said a little waspishly, and he began to move out of sight again. 
Only the edge of his hat brim remained in view when Harry gave a sudden shout. 

 ��Wait! Have you told Snape you saw this?��

 Phineas Nigellus stuck his blindfolded head back into the picture. 

��Professor Snape has more important things on his mind than the many eccentricities of Albus 

Dumbledore. Good-bye, Potter!��

 And with that, he vanished completely, leaving behind him nothing but his murky backdrop. 

 ��Harry!�� Hermione cried. 

��I know!�� Harry shouted. Unable to contain himself, he punched the air; it was more than he 
had dared to hope for. He strode up and down the tent, feeling that he could have run a mile; he did 
not even feel hungry anymore. Hermione was squashing��ѹ 
Phineas Nigellus��s back into the 
beaded bag; when she had fastened the clasp she threw the bag aside and raised a shining face to 
Harry. 

��The sword can destroy Horcruxes! Goblin-made blades imbibe only that which strengthens 
them - Harry, that sword��s impregnated (saturate, imbue) with basilisk venom!�� 

��And Dumbledore didn��t give it to me because he still needed it, he wanted to use it on the 
locket -��

 ��- and he must have realized they wouldn��t let you have it if he put it in his will -��

 ��- so he made a copy -��

 ��- and put a fake in the glass case -��

 ��- and he left the real one - where?��

��219ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

They gazed at east other. Harry felt that the answer was dangling invisibly in the air above 
them, tantalizingly close. Why hadn��t Dumbledore told him? Or had he, in fact, told Harry, but 
Harry had not realized it at the time?

 ��Think!�� whispered Hermione. ��Think! Where would he have left it?��

 ��Not at Hogwarts,�� said Harry, resuming his pacing.

 ��Somewhere in Hogsmeade?�� suggested Hermione.

 ��The Shrieking Shack?�� said Harry. ��Nobody ever goes in there.��

 ��But Snape knows how to get in, wouldn��t that be a bit risky?��

 ��Dumbledore trusted Snape,�� Harry reminded her. 

 ��Not enough to tell him that he had swapped the swords,�� said Hermione. 

��Yeah, you��re right!�� said Harry, and he felt even more cheered at the thought that Dumbledore 
had had some reservations, however faint, about Snape��s trustworthiness. ��So, would he have 
hidden the sword well away from Hogsmeade, then? What d��you reckon, Ron? Ron?�� 

Harry looked around. For one bewildered moment he thought that Ron had left the tent, then 
realized that Ron was lying in the shadow of a bunk, looking stony.

 ��Oh, remembered me, have you?�� he said. 

 ��What?��

 Ron snorted as he stared up at the underside of the upper bunk. 

 ��You two carry on. Don��t let me spoil your fun.�� 

Perplexed, Harry looked to Hermione for help, but she shook her head, apparently as 

nonplussed as he was. 

 ��What��s the problem?�� asked Harry. 

��Problem? There��s no problem,�� said Ron, still refusing to look at Harry. ��Not according to 

you, anyways.��

 There were several plunks�������� 
on the canvas over their heads. It had started to rain. 

 ��Well, you��ve obviously got a problem,�� said Harry. ��Spit it out, will you?��

 Ron swung his long legs off the bed and sat up. He looked mean, unlike himself. 

��All right, I��ll spit it out. Don��t expect me to skip up and down the tent because there��s some 
other damn thing we��ve got to find. Just add it to the list of stuff you don��t know.��

 ��I don��t know?�� repeated Harry. ��I don��t know?��

��220ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank 
all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry��s jubilation; 
Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking. 

��It��s not like I��m not having the time of my life here,�� said Ron, ��you know, with my arm 
mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after 
we��d been running round a few weeks, we��d have achieved something.�� 

��Ron,�� Hermione said, but in such a quiet voice that Ron could pretend not to have heard it 

over the loud tattoo�����н�����û��� the rain was beating on the tent.

 ��I thought you knew what you��d signed up for,�� said Harry.

 ��Yeah, I thought I did too.�� 

��So what part of it isn��t living up to your expectations?�� asked Harry. Anger was coming to his 
defense now. ��Did you think we��d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux every other 
day? Did you think you��d be back to Mummy by Christmas?�� 

��We thought you knew what you were doing!�� shouted Ron, standing up, and his words pierced 
Harry like scalding knives. ��We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do, we thought you had 
a real plan!�� 

��Ron!�� said Hermione, this time clearly audible over the rain thundering on the tent roof, but 
again, he ignored her. 

��Well, sorry to let you down,�� said Harry, his voice quite calm even though he felt hollow, 
inadequate. ��I��ve been straight with you from the start. I told you everything Dumbledore told me. 
And in the case you haven��t noticed, we��ve found one Horcrux -�� 

��Yeah, and we��re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them -nowhere 
effing near in other words.�� 

��Take off the locket, Ron,�� Hermione said, her voice unusually high. ��Please take it off. You 
wouldn��t be talking like this if you hadn��t been wearing it all day.�� 

��Yeah, he would,�� said Harry, who did not want excuses made for Ron. ��D��you think I haven��t 
noticed the two of you whispering behind my back? D��you think I didn��t guess you were thinking 
this stuff?

 ��Harry, we weren��t -�� 

��Don��t lie!�� Ron hurled at her. ��You said it too, you said you were disappointed, you said

you��d thought he had a bit more to go on than -��

 ��I didn��t say it like that - Harry, I didn��t!�� she cried. 

The rain was pounding the tent, tears were pouring down Hermione��s face, and the excitement 
of a few minutes before had vanished as if it had never been, a short-lived firework that had flared 
and died, leaving everything dark, wet, and cold. The sword of Gryffindor was hidden they knew 
not where, and they were three teenagers in a tent whose only achievement was not, yet, to be 
dead.

 ��So why are you still here?�� Harry asked Ron. 

��Search me,�� said Ron. 

 ��Go home then,�� said Harry. 

��Yeah, maybe I will!�� shouted Ron, and he took several steps toward Harry, who did not back 
away. ��Didn��t you hear what they said about my sister? But you don��t give a rat��s fart, do you, it��s 
only the Forbidden Forest, Harry I��ve-Faced-Worse Potter doesn��t care what happened to her in 
there - well, I do, all right, giant spiders and mental stuff -��

 ��I was only saying - she was with the others, they were with Hagrid -�� 

��Yeah, I get it, you don��t care! And what about the rest of my family, 'the Weasleys don��t need 
another kid injured,' did you hear that?�� 

��Yeah, I -��

 ��Not bothered what it meant, though?��

 ��Ron!�� said Hermione, forcing her way between them. ��I don��t think it means anything new has 
happened, anything we don��t know about; think, Ron, Bill��s already scarred, plenty of people must 
have seen that George has lost an ear by now, and you��re supposed to be on your deathbed with 
spattergroit, I��m sure that��s all he meant -�� 

��Oh, you��re sure, are you? Right then, well, I won��t bother myself about them. It��s all right for 

you, isn��t it, with your parents safely out of the way -��

 ��My parents are dead!�� Harry bellowed.

 ��And mine could be going the same way!�� yelled Ron. 

��Then GO!�� roared Harry. ��Go back to them, pretend you��ve got over your spattergroit and 
Mummy��ll be able to feed you up and -�� 

Ron made a sudden movement, Harry reacted, but before either wand was clear of its owner��s

pocket, Hermione had raised her own. 

��Prestego!�� she cried, and an invisible shield expanded between her and Harry on the one side 
and Ron on the other; all of them were forced backward a few steps by the strength of the spell, 
and Harry and Ron glared from either side of the transparent barrier as though they were seeing 
each other clearly for the first time. Harry felt a corrosive hatred toward Ron, Something had 
broken between them.

 ��Leave the Horcrux,�� Harry said. 

Ron wrenched the chain from over his head and cast the locket into a nearby chair. He turned to 
Hermione.

 ��What are you doing?��

 ��What do you mean?��

 ��Are you staying, or what?�� 

��I ...�� She looked anguished. ��Yes -yes, I��m staying. Ron, we said we��d go with Harry, we said 

we��d help -��

 ��I get it. You choose him.��

 ��Ron, no �C please - come back, come back!�� 

She was impeded by her own Shield Charm; by the time she had removed it he had already 

stormed into the night. Harry stood quite still and silent, listening to her sobbing and calling Ron��s 

name amongst the trees.

 After a few minutes she returned, her sopping hair plastered to her face.

 ��He��s g-g-gone! Disapparated!��

 She threw herself into a chair, curled up, and started to cry. 

Harry felt dazed. He stooped, picked up the Horcrux, and placed it around his own neck. He 
dragged blankets off Ron��s bunk and threw them over Hermione. Then he climbed onto his own 
bed and stared up at the dark canvas roof, listening to the pounding of the rain.

turning his 
bunk. It was 
eyes. Harry 
eyes averted 

from Ron's. Hermione, who was already busy in the kitchen, did not wish Harry good morning, but 
turned her face away quickly as he went by. 

He's gone, Harry told himself. He's gone. He had to keep thinking it as he washed and dressed as 
though repetition would dull the shock of it. He's gone and he's not coming back. And that was the 
simple truth of it, Harry knew, because their protective enchantments meant that it would be 
impossible, once they vacated this spot, for Ron to find them again. 

He and Hermione ate breakfast in silence. Hermione's eyes were puffy and red�ֺ����� 
; she 
looked as if she had not slept. They packed up their things, Hermione dawdling. Harry knew why 
she wanted to spin out���ӳ� 
their time on the riverbank; several times he saw her look up eagerly, 
and he was sure she had deluded herself into thinking that she heard footsteps through the heavy 
rain, but no red-haired figure appeared between the trees. Every time Harry imitated her, looked 
around (for he could not help hoping a little, himself) and saw nothing but rain-swept woods, 
another little parcel of fury exploded inside him. He could hear Ron saying, "We thought you knew 
what you were doing!", and he resumed packing with a hard knot in the pit of his stomach. 

The muddy river beside them was rising rapidly and would soon spill over onto their bank. They 
had lingered a good���� hour after they would usually have departed their campsite. Finally 
having entirely repacked the beaded bag three times, Hermione seemed unable to find any more 
reasons to delay. She and Harry gasped hands and Disapparated, reappearing on a windswept 
heatherʯ�ϻ�-covered hillside. 

The instant they arrived, Hermione dropped Harry's hand and walked away from him, finally

sitting down on a large rock, her face on her knees, shaking with what he knew were sobs. He 
watched her, supposing that he ought to go and comfort her, but something kept him rooted to the 
spot. Everything inside him felt cold and tight. Again he saw the contemptuous expression on 
Ron's face. Harry strode off through the heather, walking in a large circle with the distraught 
Hermione at its center, casting the spell she usually performed to ensure their protection. 

They did not discuss Ron at all over the next few days. Harry was determined never to mention 
his name again and Hermione seemed to know that it was no use forcing the issue, although 
sometimes at night when she thought he was sleeping, he would hear her crying. Meanwhile Harry 
had started bringing out the Marauder's map and examining it by wandlight. He was waiting for 
the moment when Ron's labeled dot would reappear in the corridors of Hogwarts, proving that he 
had returned to the comfortable castle, protected by his status of pureblood. However, Ron did not 
appear on the map and after a while Harry found himself taking it out simply to stare at Ginny's 
name in the girl's dormitory, wondering whether the intensity with which he gazed at it might 
break into her sleep, that she would somehow know he was thinking about her, hoping that she was 
all right. 

By day, they devoted themselves to trying to determine the possible locations of Gryffindor's 
sword, but the more they talked about the places in which Dumbledore might have hidden it, the 
more desperate and far-fetched their speculation became. Cudgel his brains though he might, Harry 
could not remember Dumbledore ever mentioning a place in which he might hide something. 
There were moments when he did not know whether he was angrier with Ron or with Dumbledore. 
We thought you knew what you were doing ... We thought Dumbledore had told you what to do ... 
We thought you had a real plan! 

He could not hide it from himself, Ron had been right. Dumbledore had left him with virtually 
nothing. They had discovered one Horcrux, but they had no means of destroying it. The others 
were as unattainable as they had ever been. Hopelessness threatened to engulf him. He was 
staggered (shocked) now to think of his own presumption in accepting his friends' offers to 
accompany him on this meandering���� 
, pointless journey. He knew nothing, he had no ideas, and 
he was constantly, painfully on the alert for any indications that Hermione too was about to tell 
him that she had had enough, that she was leaving.

They were spending many evenings in near silence and Hermione took to bringing out Phineas 
Nigellus's portrait and propping it up in a chair, as though he might fill part of the gaping hole left 
by Ron's departure. Despite his previous assertion that he would never visit them again, Phineas 
Nigellus did not seem able to resist the chance to find out more about what Harry was up to and 
consented to reappear, blindfolded, every few days or so. Harry was even glad to see him, because 
he was company, albeit of a snide and taunting kind. They relished any news about what was 
happening at Hogwarts, though Phineas Nigellus was not an ideal informer. He venerated Snape, 
the first Slytherin headmaster since he himself had controlled the school, and they had to be careful 
not to criticize or ask impertinent questions about Snape, or Phineas Nigellus would instantly leave 
his painting. 

However, he did let drop certain snippets. Snape seemed to be facing a constant, low level of 
mutiny from a hard core of students. Ginny had been banned from going into Hogsmeade. Snape 
had reinstated Umbridge's old decree forbidding gatherings of three or more students or any 
unofficial student societies. From all of these things, Harry deduced that Ginny, and probably 
Neville and Luna along with her, had been doing their best to continue Dumbledore's Army. This 
scant news made Harry want to see Ginny so badly it felt like a stomachache; but it also made him 
think of Ron again, and of Dumbledore, and of Hogwarts itself, which he missed nearly as much as 
his ex-girlfriend. Indeed, as Phineas Niggellus talked about Snape's crackdown��ѹ 
, Harry 
experienced a split second of madness when he imagined simply going back to school to join the 
destabilization of Snape��s regime. Being fed and having a soft bed and other people being in 
charge seemed the most wonderful prospect in the world at this moment. But then he remembered 
that he was Undesirable Number One, that there was a ten-thousand Galleon price on his head, and 
that to walk into Hogwarts these days was just as dangerous as walking into the Ministry of Magic. 
Indeed, Phineas Nigellus inadvertently emphasized this fact by slipping in leading questions about 
Harry and Hermione��s whereabouts. Hermione shoved him back inside the beaded bag every time 
he did this, and Phineas Nigellus invariably refused to reappear for several days after these 
unceremonious good-byes. 

The weather grew colder and colder. They did not dare remain in any area too long, so rather 
than staying in the south of England, where a hard ground frost was the worst of their worries, they

continued to meander up and down the country, braving a mountainside, where sleet pounded the 
tent; a wide, flat marsh, where the tent was flooded with chill water; and a tiny island in the middle 
of a Scottish loch (Scottish) lake, where snow half buried the tent in the night. 

They had already spotted Christmas Trees twinkling from several sitting room windows before 
there came an evening when Harry resolved to suggest again, what seemed to him the only 
unexplored avenue left to them. They had just eaten an unusually good meal, Hermione had been 
to a supermarket under the Invisibility Cloak (scrupulously dropping the money into an open till as 
she left), and Harry thought that she might be more persuadable than usual on a stomach full of 
spaghetti Bolognese and tinned pears. 

He had also had the foresight to suggest that they take a few hours�� break from wearing the 

Horcrux, which was hanging over the end of the bunk beside him.

 ��Hermione?�� 

��Hmm?�� She was curled up in one of the sagging armchairs with The Tales of Beedle the Bard. 
He could not imagine how much more she could get out of the book, which was not, after all, very 
long, but evidently she was still deciphering something in it, because Spellman��s Syllabary lay 
open on the arm of the chair. 

Harry cleared his throat. He felt exactly as he had done on the occasion, several years 
previously, when he had asked Professor McGonagall whether he could go into Hogsmeade, 
despite the fact that he had not persuaded the Dursleys to sign his permission slip. 

 ��Hermione, I��ve been thinking, and �C��

 ��Harry, could you help me with something?�� 

Apparently she had not been listening to him. She leaned forward and held out The Tales of 
Beedle the Bard. 

��Look at that symbol,�� she said, pointing to the top of a page. Above what Harry assumed was 
the title of the story (being unable to read runes, he could not be sure), there was a picture of what 
looked like a triangular eye, its pupil crossed with a vertical line.

 ��I never took Ancient Runes, Hermione.�� 

��I know that; but it isn��t a rune and it��s not in the syllabary, either. All along I thought it was a 
picture of an eye, but I don��t think it is! It��s been inked in, look, somebody��s drawn it there, it isn��t 
really part of the book. Think, have you ever seen it before?��

��227ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No ... No, wait a moment.�� Harry looked closer. ��Isn��t it the same symbol Luna��s dad was 
wearing round his neck?�� 
��Well, that��s what I thought too!�� 
��Then it��s Grindelwald��s mark.��

 She stared at him, openmouthed. ��What?�� 

��Krum told me ...�� 

He recounted the story that Viktor Krum had told him at the wedding. 

Hermione looked astonished. ��Grindelwald��s mark?�� 

She looked from Harry to the weird symbol and back again. ��I��ve never heard that Grindelwald 
had a mark. There��s no mention of it in anything I��ve ever read about him.�� 
��Well, like I say, Krum reckoned that symbol was carved on a wall at Durmstrang, and 
Grindelwald put it there.�� 
She fell back into the old armchair, frowning. 
��That��s very odd. If it��s a symbol of Dark Magic, what��s it doing in a book of children��s 
stories?�� 
��Yeah, it is weird,�� said Harry. ��And you��d think Scrimgeour would have recognized it. He was 
Minister, he ought to have been expert on Dark stuff.�� 
��I know. Perhaps he thought it was an eye, just like I did. All the other stories have little pictures 
over the titles.�� She did not speak, but continued to pore over the strange mark. 

Harry tried again. ��Hermione?��

 ��Hmm?��

 ��I��ve been thinking. I �C I want to go to Godric��s Hollow.��

 She looked up at him, but her eyes were unfocused, and he was sure she was still thinking about 
the mysterious mark on the book. 

 ��Yes,�� she said. ��Yes, I��ve been wondering that too. I really think we��ll have to.��

 ��Did you hear me right?�� he asked. 

��Of course I did. You want to go to Godric��s Hollow. I agree. I think we should. I mean, I can��t 
think of anywhere else it could be either. It��ll be dangerous, but the more I think about it, the more 
likely it seems it��s there.�� 

��Er �C what��s there?�� asked Harry.

��228ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

At that, she looked just as bewildered as he felt. 
��Well, the sword, Harry! Dumbledore must have known you��d want to go back there, and I 
mean, Godric��s Hollow is Godric Gryffindor��s birthplace �C�� 
��Really? Gryffindor came from Godric��s Hollow?�� 
��Harry, did you ever even open A History of Magic?�� 
��Erm,�� he said, smiling for what felt like the first time in months. The muscles in his face felt 
oddly stiff. ��I might��ve opened it, you know, when I bought it ... just the once... �� 
��Well, as the village is named after him, I��d have thought you might have made the 
connection,�� said Hermione. 

She sounded much more like her old self than she had done of late; Harry half expected her to 
announce that she was off to the library. ��There��s a bit about the village in A History of Magic, 
wait ...�� 

She opened the beaded bag and rummaged for a while, finally extracting her copy of their old 
school textbook A History of Magic by Bathilda Bagshot, which she thumbed through (go through 
something quickly) until finding the page she wanted. 

����Upon the signature of the International Statute of Secrecy in 1689, wizards went into hiding 
for good. It was natural, perhaps, that they formed their own small communities within a 
community. Many small villages and hamlets��small village��attracted several magical families, 
who banded together for mutual support and protection. The villages of Tinworsh in Cornwall, 
Upper Flagley in Yorkshire, and Ottery St. Catchpole on the south coast of England were notable 
homes to knots of Wizarding families who lived alongside tolerant and sometimes Confunded 
Muggles. Most celebrated of these half-magical dwelling places is, perhaps, Godric��s Hollow, the 
West Country village where the great wizard Godric Gryffindor was born, and where Bowman 
Wright, Wizarding smith, forged the first Golden Snitch. The graveyard is full of the names of 
ancient magical families, and this accounts, no doubt, for the stories of hauntings that have 
dogged the little church beside it for many centuries.�� 

��You and your parents aren��t mentioned.�� Hermione said, closing the book, ��because Professor 
Bagshot doesn��t cover anything later than the end of the nineteenth century. But you see? Godric��s 
Hollow, Godric Gryffindor, Gryffindor��s sword; don��t you think Dumbledore would have expected 
you to make the connection?��

��229ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Oh yeah ...�� 

Harry did not want to admit that he had not been thinking about the sword at all when he 
suggested they go to Godric��s Hollow. For him, the lure of the village lay in his parents�� graves, 
the house where he had narrowly escaped death, and in the person of Bathilda Bagshot. 

 ��Remember what Muriel said?�� he asked eventually.

 ��Who?�� 

��You know,�� he hesitated. He did not want to say Ron��s name. ��Ginny��s great-aunt. At the 
wedding. The one who said you had skinny ankles.�� 

��Oh,�� said Hermione. It was a sticky moment, Harry knew that she had sensed Ron��s name in 

the offing (�ڸ����������Ҫ���Ƶ�). He rushed on:

 ��She said Bathilda Bagshot still lived in Godric��s Hollow.�� 

��Bathilda Bagshot,�� murmured Hermione, running her index finger over Bathilda��s embossed

ʹ������� name on the front cover of A History of Magic. ��Well, I suppose �C�� 

She gasped so dramatically that Harry��s insides turned over; he drew his wand, looking around 
at the entrance, half expecting to see a hand forcing its way through the entrance flap, but there 
was nothing there. 

��What?�� he said, half angry, half relieved. ��What did you do that for? I thought you��d seen a 

Death Eater unzipping the tent, at least �C��

 ��Harry, what if Bathilda��s got the sword? What if Dumbledore entrusted it to her?�� 

Harry considered this possibility. Bathilda would be an extremely old woman by now, and 
according to Muriel, she was ��gaga.�� Was it likely that Dumbledore would have hidden the sword 
of Gryffindor with her? If so, Harry felt that Dumbledore had left a great deal to chance, 
Dumbledore had never revealed that he had replaced the sword with a fake, nor had he so much as 
mentioned a friendship with Bathilda. Now, however, was not the moment to cast doubt on 
Hermione��s theory, not when she was so surprisingly willing to fall in with (agree with) Harry��s 
dearest wish. 

 ��Yeah, he might have done! So, are we going to go to Godric��s Hollow?�� 

��Yes, but we��ll have to think it through carefully, Harry.�� She was sitting up now, and Harry 
could tell that the prospect of having a plan again had lifted her mood as much as his. ��We��ll need 
to practice Disapparating together under the Invisibility Cloak for a start, and perhaps

��230ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Disillusionment Charms would be sensible too, unless you think we should go the whole hog����
�ɣ��ɵ��� 
and use Polyjuice Potion? In that case we��ll need to collect hair from somebody. I 
actually think we��d better do that, Harry, the thicker our disguises the better.�� 

Harry let her talk, nodding and agreeing whenever there was a pause, but his mind had left the 
conversation. For the first time since he had discovered that the sword in Gringotts was a fake, he 
felt excited. 

He was about to go home, about to return to the place where he had had a family. It was in 
Godric��s Hollow that, but for Voldemort, he would have grown up and spent every school holiday. 
He could have invited friends to his house... He might even have had brothers and sisters... It 
would have been his mother who had made his seventeenth birthday cake. The life he had lost had 
hardly ever seemed so real to him as at this moment, when he knew he was about to see the place 
where it had been taken from him. 

After Hermione had gone to bed that night, Harry quietly extracted his rucksack from 
Hermione��s beaded bag, and from inside it, the photograph album Hagrid had given him so long 
ago. For the first time in months, he perused the old pictures of his parents, smiling and waving up 
at him from the images, which were all he had left of them now. 

Harry would gladly have set out for Godric��s Hollow the following day, but Hermione had 
other ideas. Convinced as she was that Voldemort would expect Harry to return to the scene of his 
parents�� deaths, she was determined that they would set off only after they had ensured that they 
had the best disguises possible. It was therefore a full week later �C once they had surreptitiously 
obtained hairs from innocent Muggles who were Christmas shopping, and had practiced 
Apparating and Disapparating while underneath the Invisibility Cloak together �C that Hermione 
agreed to make the journey. 

They were to Apparate to the village under cover of darkness, so it was late afternoon when 
they finally swallowed Polyjuice Potion, Harry transforming into a balding, middle-aged Muggle 
man, Hermione into his small and rather mousy wife. The beaded bag containing all of their 
possessions (apart from the Horcrux, which Harry was wearing around his neck) was tucked into 
an inside pocket of Hermione��s buttoned-up coat. Harry lowered the Invisibility Cloak over them, 
then they turned into the suffocating darkness once again.

��231ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Heart beating in his throat, Harry opened his eyes. They were standing hand in hand in a snowy 
lane under a dark blue sky, in which the night��s first stars were already glimmering feebly. 
Cottages stood on either side of the narrow road, Christmas decorations twinkling in their 
windows. A short way ahead of them, a glow of golden streetlights indicated the center of the 
village. 

��All this snow!�� Hermione whispered beneath the cloak. ��Why didn��t we think of snow? After 
all our precautions, we��ll leave prints! We��ll just have to get rid of them �C you go in front, I��ll do it 
�C�� 

Harry did not want to enter the village like a pantomime horse, trying to keep themselves 
concealed while magically covering their traces.

 ��Let��s take off the Cloak,�� said Harry, and when she looked frightened, ��Oh, come on, we don��t 
look like us and there��s no one around.�� 

He stowed the Cloak under his jacket and they made their way forward unhampered, the icy air 
stinging their faces as they passed more cottages. Any one of them might have been the one in 
which James and Lily had once lived or where Bathilda lived now. Harry gazed at the front doors, 
their snow-burdened roofs, and their front porches, wondering whether he remembered any of 
them, knowing deep inside that it was impossible, that he had been little more than a year old when 
he had left this place forever. He was not even sure whether he would be able to see the cottage at 
all; he did not know what happened when the subjects of a Fidelius Charm died. Then the little 
lane along which they were walking curved to the left and the heart of the village, a small square, 
was revealed to them. 

Strung all around with colored lights, there was what looked like a war memorial in the middle, 
partly obscured by a windblown Christmas tree. There were several shops, a post office, a pub, and 
a little church whose stained-glass windows��ɫ������ 
were glowing jewel-bright across the 
square. 

The snow here had become impactedѹ����. It was hard and slippery where people had 
trodden on it all day. Villagers were crisscrossing in front of them, their figures briefly illuminated 
by streetlamps. They heard a snatch of laughter and pop music as the pub door opened and closed; 
then they heard a carol start up inside the little church. 

 ��Harry, I think it��s Christmas Eve!�� said Hermione.

��232ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Is it?��

 He had lost track of the date; they had not seen a newspaper for weeks. 

��I��m sure it is,�� said Hermione, her eyes upon the church. ��They ... they��ll be in there, won��t 
they? Your mum and dad? I can see the graveyard behind it.�� 

Harry felt a thrill of something that was beyond excitement, more like fear. Now that he was so 
near, he wondered whether he wanted to see after all. Perhaps Hermione knew how he was feeling, 
because she reached for his hand and took the lead for the first time, pulling him forward. Halfway 
across the square, however, she stopped dead.

 ��Harry, look!�� 

She was pointing at the war memorial. As they had passed it, it had transformed. Instead of an 
obelisk����ʯ�� 
covered in names, there was a statue of three people, a man with untidy hair and 
glasses, a woman with long hair and a kind, pretty face, and a baby boy sitting in his mother��s 
arms. Snow lay upon all their heads, like fluffy white caps. 

Harry drew closer, gazing up into his parents�� faces. He had never imagined that there would be 
a statue... How strange it was to see himself represented in stone, a happy baby without a scar on 
his forehead... 

��C'mon,�� said Harry, when he had looked his fill, and they turned again toward the church. As 
they crossed the road, he glanced over his shoulder; the statue had turned back into the war 
memorial. 

The singing grew louder as they approached the church. It made Harry��s throat constrict, it 
reminded him so forcefully of Hogwarts, of Peeves bellowing rude versions of carols from inside 
suits of armor, of the Great Hall��s twelve Christmas trees, of Dumbledore wearing a bonnet he had 
won in a cracker, of Ron in a hand-knitted sweater... 

 There was a kissing gate at the entrance to the graveyard. Hermione pushed it open as quietly as 
possible and they edged�����ƶ� 
through it. On either side of the slippery path to the church 
doors, the snow lay deep and untouched. They moved off through the snow, carving deep trenches 
behind them as they walked around the building, keeping to the shadows beneath the brilliant 
windows. 

Behind the church, row upon row of snowy tombstones protruded from a blanket of pale blue 
that was flecked with dazzling red, gold, and green wherever the reflections from the stained glass

��233ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

hit the snow. Keeping his hand closed tightly on the wand in his jacket pocket, Harry moved 

toward the nearest grave. 

 ��Look at this, it��s an Abbott, could be some long-lost relation of Hannah��s!��

 ��Keep your voice down,�� Hermione begged him. 

They waded deeper and deeper into the graveyard, gouging dark tracks into the snow behind 

them, stooping to peer at the words on old headstones, every now and then squinting into the 

surrounding darkness to make absolutely sure that they were unaccompanied.

 ��Harry, here!�� 

Hermione was two rows of tombstones away; he had to wade back to her, his heart positively 

banging in his chest.

 ��Is it �C?��

 ��No, but look!�� 

She pointed to the dark stone. Harry stooped down and saw, upon the frozen, lichen��̦޺ 
spotted 
granite, the words Kendra Dumbledore and, a short way down her dates of birth and death, 
and Her Daughter Ariana. There was also a quotation: 

Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. 

So Rita Skeeter and Muriel had got some of their facts right. The Dumbledore family had 
indeed lived here, and part of it had died here. 

Seeing the grave was worse than hearing about it. Harry could not help thinking that he and 
Dumbledore both had deep roots in this graveyard, and that Dumbledore ought to have told him so, 
yet he had never thought to share the connection. They could have visited the place together; for a 
moment Harry imagined coming here with Dumbledore, of what a bond that would have been, of 
how much it would have meant to him. But it seemed that, to Dumbledore, the fact that their 
families lay side by side in the same graveyard had been an unimportant coincidence, irrelevant, 
perhaps, to the job he wanted Harry to do. 

Hermione was looking at Harry, and he was glad that his face was hidden in shadow. He read 
the words on the tombstone again. Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. He did not 
understand what these words meant. Surely Dumbledore had chosen them, as the eldest member of

��234ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the family once his mother had died. 

 ��Are you sure he never mentioned �C?�� Hermione began. 

��No,�� said Harry curtly, then, ��let��s keep looking,�� and he turned away, wishing he had not 
seen the stone, He did not want his excited trepidation�־� 
tainted with resentment. 

��Here!�� cried Hermione again a few moments later from out of the darkness. ��Oh no, sorry! I 
thought it said Potter.��

 She was rubbing at a crumbling, mossy stone, gazing down at it, a little frown on her face.

 ��Harry, come back a moment.�� 

He did not want to be sidetracked again, and only grudgingly made his way back through the 

snow toward her. 

 ��What?�� 

��Look at this!�� The grave was extremely old, weathered so that Harry could hardly make out 

the name. Hermione showed him the symbol beneath it. 

 ��Harry, that��s the mark in the book!�� 

He peered at the place she indicated. The stone was so worn that it was hard to make out what 

was engraved there, though there did seem to be a triangular mark beneath the nearly illegible 

name.

 ��Yeah ... it could be... ��

 Hermione lit her wand and pointed it at the name on the headstone. 

��It says Ig �C Ignotus, I think... �� 

��I��m going to keep looking for my parents, all right?�� Harry told her, a slight edge to his voice, 
and he set off again, leaving her crouched beside the old grave. 

Every now and then he recognized a surname that, like Abbott, he had met at Hogwarts. 
Sometimes there were several generations of the same Wizarding family represented in the 
graveyard. Harry could tell from the dates that it had either died out, or the current members had 
moved away from Godric��s Hollow. Deeper and deeper amongst the graves he went, and every 
time he reached a new headstone he felt a little lurch of apprehension and anticipation. 

The darkness and the silence seemed to become, all of a sudden, much deeper. Harry looked 
around, worried, thinking of dementors, then realized that the carols had finished, that the chatter 
and flurry of churchgoers were fading away as they made their way back into the square.

��235ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Somebody inside the church had just turned off the lights. 

Then Hermione��s voice came out of the blackness for the third time, sharp and clear from a few 
yards away.

 ��Harry, they��re here ... right here.�� 

And he knew by her tone that it was his mother and father this time, He moved toward her, 
feeling as if something heavy were pressing on his chest, the same sensation he had had right after 
Dumbledore had died, a grief that had actually weighed on his heart and lungs. 

The headstone was only two rows behind Kendra and Ariana��s. It was made of white marble, 
just like Dumbledore��s tomb, and this made it easy to read, as it seemed to shine in the dark. Harry 
did not need to kneel or even approach very close to it to make out the words engraved upon it. 

JAMES POTTER LILY POTTER 
BORN 27 MARCH 1960 BORN 30 JANUARY 1960 
DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 DIED 31 OCTOBER 1981 


The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. 

Harry read the words slowly, as though he would have only one chance to take in their 
meaning, and he read the last of them aloud. 

��'The last enemy that shall be defeated is death'.�� A horrible thought came to him, and with a 
kind of panic. ��Isn��t that a Death Eater idea? Why is that there?�� 

��It doesn��t mean defeating death in the way the Death Eaters mean it, Harry,�� said Hermione, 
her voice gentle. ��It means ... you know ... living beyond death. Living after death.�� 

But they were not living, thought Harry. They were gone. The empty words could not disguise 
the fact that his parents�� moldering remains lay beneath snow and stone, indifferent, unknowing. 
And tears came before he could stop them, boiling hot then instantly freezing on his face, and what 
was the point in wiping them off or pretending? He let them fall, his lips pressed hard together, 
looking down at the thick snow hiding from his eyes the place where the last of Lily and James 
lay, bones now, surely, or dust, not knowing or caring that their living son stood so near, his heart 
still beating, alive because of their sacrifice and close to wishing, at this moment, that he was 
sleeping under the snow with them.

Hermione had taken his hand again and was gripping it tightly. He could not look at her, but 
returned the pressure, now taking deep, sharp gulps of the night air, trying to steady himself, trying 
to regain control. He should have brought something to give them, and he had not thought of it, 
and every plant in the graveyard was leafless and frozen. But Hermione raised her wand, moved it 
in a circle through the air, and a wreath of Christmas roses blossomed before them. Harry caught it 
and laid it on his parents�� grave. 

As soon as he stood up he wanted to leave. He did not think he could stand another moment 
there. He put his arm around Hermione��s shoulders, and she put hers around his waist, and they 
turned in silence and walked away through the snow, past Dumbledore��s mother and sister, back 
toward the dark church and the out-of-sight kissing gate.

Chapter Seventeen 
Bathilda��s Secret 



"Harry, stop." 

"What's wrong?" 

They had only just reached the grave of the 


unknown 
Abbott. 
"There's someone there. Someone watching us. I 

can tell. There, 
over by the bushes." 
They stood quite still, holding on to each other, gazing at the dense black boundary of the 

graveyard. Harry could not see anything. 

"Are you sure?" 

"I saw something move. I could have sworn I did...�� 

She broke from him to free her wand arm. 

"We look like Muggles," Harry pointed out. 

"Muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave? Harry, I'm sure there's 

someone over there!" 

Harry thought of A History of Magic; the graveyard was supposed to be haunted; what if -? But 
then he heard a rustle and saw a little eddy���� 
of dislodged snow in the bush to which Hermione 
had pointed. Ghosts could not move snow. 

"It's a cat," said Harry, after a second or two, "or a bird. If it was a Death Eater we'd be dead by 
now. But let's get out of here, and we can put the Cloak back on." 

They glanced back repeatedly as they made their way out of the graveyard. Harry, who did not 
feel as sanguine�ֹ۵�as he had pretended when reassuring Hermione, was glad to reach the gate 
and the slippery pavement. They pulled the Invisibility Cloak back over themselves. The pub was 
fuller than before. Many voices inside it were now singing the carol that they had heard as they 
approached the church. 

For a moment, Harry considered suggesting they take refuge inside it, but before he could say 
anything Hermione murmured, "Let's go this way," and pulled him down the dark street leading 
out of the village in the opposite direction from which they had entered. Harry could make out the

��238ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

point where the cottages ended and the lane turned into open country again. They walked as 
quickly as they dared, past more windows sparkling with multicolored lights, the outlines of 
Christmas trees dark through the curtains. 

"How are we going to find Bathilda's house?" asked Hermione, who was shivering a little and 
kept glancing back over her shoulder. "Harry? What do you think? Harry?" 

She tugged at this arm, but Harry was not paying attention. He was looking toward the dark 
mass that stood at the very end of this row of houses. Next moment he sped up, dragging 
Hermione along with him, she slipped a little on the ice. 

"Harry -" 

"Look ... Look at it, Hermione ...�� 

"I don't ... oh!" 

He could see it; the Fidelius Charm must have died with James and Lily. The hedge had grown 
wild in the sixteen years since Hagrid had taken Harry from the rubble that lay scattered amongst 
the waist-high grass. Most of the cottage was still standing, though entirely covered in the dark ivy 
and snow, but the right side of the top floor had been blown apart; that, Harry was sure, was where 
the curse had backfired. He and Hermione stood at the gate, gazing up at the wreck of what must 
once have been a cottage just like those that flanked it. 

"I wonder why nobody's ever rebuilt it?" whispered Hermione. 

"Maybe you can't rebuild it." Harry replied. "Maybe it's like the injuries from Dark Magic and 
you can't repair the damage." 

He slipped a hand from beneath the Cloak and grasped the snowy and thickly rusted gate, not 
wishing to open it, but simply to hold some part of the house. 

"You're not going to go inside? It looks unsafe, it might - oh, Harry, look!" 

His touch on the gate seemed to have done it. A sign had risen out of the ground in front of 
them, up thorough the tangles of nettles and weeds, like some bizarre, fast-growing flower, and in 
golden letters upon the wood it said: 

On this spot, on this night of 31 October 1981, 
Lily and James Potter lost their lives. 
Their son, Harry, remains the only wizard


��239ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

ever to have survived the Killing Curse. 
This house, invisible to Muggles, has been left 
in its ruined state as a monument to the Potters 
and as a reminder of the violence 
that tore apart their family. 


And all around these neatly lettered words, scribbles had been added by other witches and 
wizards who had come to see the place where the Boy Who Lived had escaped. Some had merely 
signed their names in Everlasting Ink; others had carved their initials into the wood, still others had 
left messages. The most recent of these, shining brightly over sixteen years' worth of magical 
graffiti, all said similar things. 

Good luck, Harry, wherever you are. 
If you read this, Harry, we're all behind you! 
Long live Harry Potter. 


"They shouldn't have written on the sign!" said Hermione, indignant. 

But Harry beamed at her. 

"It's brilliant. I'm glad they did. I ...�� 

He broke off. A heavily muffled figure was hobbling up the lane toward them, silhouetted by the 
bright lights in the distant square. Harry thought, though it was hard to judge, that the figure was a 
woman. She was moving slowly, possibly frightened of slipping on the snowy ground. Her stoop, 
her stoutness, her shuffling gait all gave an impression of extreme age. They watched in silence as 
she drew nearer. Harry was waiting to see whether she would turn into any of the cottages she was 
passing, but he knew instinctively that she would not. At last she came to a halt a few yards from 
them and simply stood there in the middle of the frozen road, facing them. 

He did not need Hermione's pinch to his arm. There was next to no chance that this woman was 
a Muggle, She was standing there gazing at a house that ought to have been completely invisible to 
her, if she was not a witch. Even assuming that she was a witch, however, it was odd behavior to 
come out on a night this cold, simply to look at an old ruin. By all the rules of normal magic, 
meanwhile, she ought not to be able to see Hermione and him at all. Nevertheless, Harry had the 
strangest feeling that she knew that they were there, and also who they were. Just as he had

��240ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

reached this uneasy conclusion, she raised a gloved hand and beckoned. 

Hermione moved closer to him under the Cloak, her arm pressed against his. 

"How does she know?" 

He shook his head. 

The woman beckoned again, more vigorously. Harry could think of many reasons not to obey 
the summons, and yet his suspicions about her identity were growing stronger every moment that 
they stood facing each other in the deserted street. Was it possible that she had been waiting for 
them all these long months? That Dumbledore had told her to wait, and that Harry would come in 
the end? Was it not likely that it was she who had moved in the shadows in the graveyard and had 
followed them to this spot? Even her ability to sense them suggested some Dumbledore-ish power 
that he had never encountered before. Finally Harry spoke, causing Hermione to gasp and jump. 

"Are you Bathilda?" 

The muffled figure nodded and beckoned again. 

Beneath the Cloak Harry and Hermione looked at each other. Harry raised his eyebrows; 
Hermione gave a tiny, nervous nod. They stepped toward the woman and, at once, she turned and 
hobbled off back the way they had come. Leading them past several houses, she turned in at a gate. 
They followed her up the front path through a garden nearly as overgrown as the one they had just 
left. She fumbled for a moment with a key at the front door, then opened it and stepped back to let 
them pass. 

She smelled bad, or perhaps it was her house; Harry wrinkled his nose as they sidled past her 
and pulled off the Cloak. Now that he was beside her, he realized how tiny she was; bowed down 
with age, she came barely level with his chest. She closed the door behind them, her knuckles blue 
and mottled against the peeling paint, then turned and peered into Harry's face. Her eyes were thick 
with cataracts������ 
and sunken into folds of transparent skin, and her whole face was dotted with 
broken veins and liver spots. He wondered whether she could make him out at all; even if she 
could, it was the balding Muggle whose identity he had stolen that she would see. 

The odor of old age, of dust, of unwashed clothes and stale food intensified as she unwound a 
moth-eaten black shawl, revealing a head of scant white hair through which the scalp showed 
clearly. 

"Bathilda?" Harry repeated.

��241ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

She nodded again. Harry became aware of the locket against his skin; the thing inside it that 
sometimes ticked or beat had woken; he could feel it pulsing through the cold gold. Did it know, 
could it sense, that the thing that would destroy it was near? Bathilda shuffled past them, pushing 
Hermione aside as though she had not seen her, and vanished into what seemed to be a sitting 
room. 

"Harry, I'm not sure about this," breathed Hermione. 

"Look at the size of her, I think we could overpower her if we had to," said Harry. "Listen, I 
should have told you, I knew she wasn't all there. Muriel called her 'gaga'." 

"Come!" called Bathilda from the next room. 

Hermione jumped and clutched Harry's arm. 

"It's okay," said Harry reassuringly, and he led the way into the sitting room. 

Bathilda was tottering around the place lighting candles, but it was still very dark, not to 
mention extremely dirty. Thick dust crunched beneath their feet, and Harry's nose detected, 
underneath the dank��ʪ�� and mildewed��ù 
smell, something worse, like meat gone bad. He 
wondered when was the last time anyone had been inside Bathilda's house to check whether she 
was coping. She seemed to have forgotten that she could do magic, too, for she lit the candles 
clumsily by hand, her trailing lace cuff in constant danger of catching fire. 

"Let me do that," offered Harry, and he took the matches from her. She stood watching him as 
he finished lighting the candle stubs that stood on saucers around the room, perched precariously 
on stacks of books and on side tables crammed with cracked and moldy cups. 

The last surface on which Harry spotted a candle was a bow-frontedǰ���ǹ��ε� chest of 
drawers�嶷�� 
;�¹�on which there stood a large number of photographs. When the flame danced 
into life, its reflection wavered on their dusty glass and silver. He saw a few tiny movements from 
the pictures. As Bathilda fumbled with logs for the fire, he muttered "Tergeo". The dust vanished 
from the photographs, and he saw at once that half a dozen were missing from the largest and most 
ornate frames. He wondered whether Bathilda or somebody else had removed them. Then the sight 
of a photograph near the back of the collection caught his eye, and he snatched it up. 

It was the golden-haired, merry-faced thief, the young man who had perched on Gregorovitch's 
windowsill, smiling lazily up at Harry out of the silver frame. And it came to Harry instantly where 
he had seen the boy before, in The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore, arm in arm with the teenage

��242ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Dumbledore, and that must be where all the missing photographs were, in Rita's book. 

"Mrs. - Miss - Bagshot?" he said, and his voice shook slightly. "Who is this?" 

Bathilda was standing in the middle of the room watching Hermione light the fire for her. 

"Miss Bagshot?" Harry repeated, and he advanced with the picture in his hands as the flames 

burst into life in the fireplace. Bathilda looked up at his voice, and the Horcrux beat faster upon his 

chest. 

"Who is this person?" Harry asked her, pushing the picture forward. 

She peered at it solemnly, then up at Harry. 

"Do you know who this is?" he repeated in a much slower and louder voice than usual. "This 
man? Do you know him? What's he called?" 

Bathilda merely looked vague. Harry felt an awful frustration. How had Rita Skeeter unlocked 
Bathilda's memories? 

"Who is this man?" he repeated loudly. 

"Harry, what area you doing?" asked Hermione. 

"This picture. Hermione, it's the thief, the thief who stole from Gregorovitch! Please!" he said to 

Bathilda. "Who is this?" 

But she only stared at him. 

"Why did you ask us to come with you, Mrs. -Miss -Bagshot?" asked Hermione, raising her 
own voice. "Was there something you wanted to tell us?" 

Giving no sign that she had heard Hermione, Bathilda now shuffled a few steps closer to Harry. 
With a little jerk of her head she looked back into the hall. 

"You want us to leave?" he asked. 

She repeated the gesture, this time pointing firstly at him, then at herself, then at the ceiling. 

"Oh, right... Hermione, I think she wants me to go upstairs with her." 

"All right," said Hermione, "let's go." 

But when Hermione moved, Bathilda shook her head with surprising vigor, once more pointing 
first at Harry, then to herself. "She wants me to go with her, alone." 

"Why?" asked Hermione, and her voice rang out sharp and clear in the candlelit room, the old 
lady shook her head a little at the loud noise. 

"Maybe Dumbledore told her to give the sword to me, and only to me?"

��243ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Do you really think she knows who you are?" 

"Yes," said Harry, looking down into the milky eyes fixed upon his own. "I think she does." 

"Well, okay then, but be quick, Harry." 

"Lead the way," Harry told Bathilda. 

She seemed to understand, because she shuffled around him toward the door. Harry glanced 
back at Hermione with a reassuring smile, but he was not sure she had seen it; she stood hugging 
herself in the midst of the candlelit squalor, looking toward the bookcase. As Harry walked out of 
the room, unseen by both Hermione and Bathilda, he slipped the silver-framed photograph of the 
unknown thief inside his jacket. 

The stairs were steep and narrow; Harry was half tempted to place his hands on stout Bathilda's 
backside to ensure that she did not topple over backward on top of him, which seemed only too 
likely. Slowly, wheezing a little, she climbed to the upper landing, turned immediately right, and 
led him into a low-ceilinged bedroom. 

It was pitch-black and smelled horrible, Harry had just made out a chamber pot protruding from 
under the bed before Bathilda closed the door and even that was swallowed by the darkness. 

"Lumos," said Harry, and his wand ignited. He gave a start, Bathilda had moved close to him in 
those few seconds of darkness, and he had not heard her approach. 

"You are Potter?" she whispered. 

"Yes, I am." 

She nodded slowly, solemnly. 

Harry felt the Horcrux beating fast, faster than his own heart. It was an unpleasant, agitating 

sensation. 

"Have you got anything for me?" Harry asked, but she seemed distracted by his lit wand-tip. 

"Have you got anything for me?" he repeated. 

Then she closed her eyes and several things happened at once, Harry's scar prickled painfully; 
the Horcrux twitched so that the front of his sweater actually moved; the dark, fetid room dissolved 
momentarily. He felt a leap of joy and spoke in a high, cold voice, Hold him! 

Harry swayed where he stood. The dark, foul-smelling room seemed to close around him again; 
he did not know what had just happened. 

"Have you got anything for me?" he asked for a third time, much louder. 

��244ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Over here," she whispered, pointing to the corner. Harry raised his wand and saw the outline of 
a cluttered dressing table beneath the curtained window. 

This time she did not lead him. Harry edged between her and the unmade bed, his wand raised. 
He did not want to look away from her. 

"What is it?" he asked as he reached the dressing table, which was heaped high with what 
looked and smelled like dirty laundryҪϴ���·�. 

"There," she said, pointing at the shapeless mass. 

And in the instant that he looked away, his eyes raking the tangled mess for a sword hilt, a ruby, 
she moved weirdly. He saw it out of the corner of his eye; panic made him turn and horror 
paralyzed him as he saw the old body collapsing and a great snake pouring from the place where 
her neck had been. The snake struck as he raised his wand. The force of the bite to his forearm sent 
the wand spinning up toward the ceiling; its light swung dizzyingly around the room and was 
extinguished; Then a powerful blow from the tail to his midriff knocked the breath out of him, He 
fell backward onto the dressing table, into the mound of filthy clothing. 

He rolled sideways, narrowly avoiding the snake's tail, which thrashed down upon the table 
where he had been a second earlier. Fragments of the glass surface rained upon him as he hit the 
floor. From below he heard Hermione call, "Harry?" 

He could not get enough breath into his lungs to call back, Then a heavy smooth mass smashed 

him to the floor and he felt it slide over him, powerful, muscular... 

"No!" he gasped, pinned to the floor. 

"Yes," whispered the voice. "Yesss... hold you ... hold you ...�� 

"Accio ... Accio Wand ...�� 

But nothing happened and he needed his hands to try to force the snake from him as it coiled 
itself around his torso, squeezing the air from him, pressing the Horcrux hard into his chest, a 
circle of ice that throbbed with life, inches from his own frantic heart, and his brain was flooding 
with cold, white light, all thought obliterated, his own breath drowned, distant footsteps, 
everything going... 

A metal heart was banging outside his chest, and now he was flying, flying with triumph in his 
heart, without need of broomstick or thestral... 

He was abruptly awake in the sour-smelling darkness; Nagini had released him. He scrambled

��245ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

up and saw the snake outlined against the landing light. It struck, and Hermione dived aside with a 
shriek; her deflected curse hit the curtained window, which shattered. Frozen air filled the room as 
Harry ducked to avoid another shower of broken glass and his foot slipped on a pencil-like 
something - his wand. 

He bent and snatched it up, but now the room was full of the snake, its tail thrashing; Hermione 
was nowhere to be seen and for a moment Harry thought the worst, but then there was a loud bang 
and a flash of red light, and the snake flew into the air, smacking Harry hard in the face as it went, 
coil after heavy coil rising up to the ceiling. Harry raised his wand, but as he did so, his scar seared 
more painfully, more powerfully than it had done in years. 

"He's coming! Hermione, he's coming!" 

As he yelled the snake fell, hissing wildly. Everything was chaos. It smashed shelves from the 
wall, and splintered china flew everywhere as Harry jumped over the bed and seized the dark 
shape he knew to be Hermione. 

She shrieked with pain as he pulled her back across the bed, The snake reared again, but Harry 
knew that worse than the snake was coming, was perhaps already at the gate, his head was going to 
split open with the pain from his scar. 

The snake lunged as he took a running leap, dragging Hermione with him; as it struck, 
Hermione screamed, "Confringo!" and her spell flew around the room, exploding the wardrobe 
mirror and ricocheting back at them, bouncing from floor to ceiling; Harry felt the heat of it sear 
the back of his hand. Glass cut his cheek as, pulling Hermione with him, he leapt from bed to 
broken dressing table and then straight out of the smashed window into nothingness, her scream 
reverberating through the night as they twisted in midair ... 

And then his scar burst open and he was Voldemort and he was running across the fetid 
bedroom, his long white hands clutching at the windowsill as he glimpsed the bald man and the 
little woman twist and vanish, and he screamed with rage, a scream that mingled with the girl's, 
that echoed across the dark gardens over the church bells ringing in Christmas Day... 

And his scream was Harry's scream, his pain was Harry's pain... that it could happen here, where 
it had happened before... here, within sight of that house where he had come so close to knowing 
what it was to die ... to die ... the pain was so terrible ... ripped from his body ... But if he had no 
body, why did his head hurt so badly; if he was dead, how cold he feel so unbearably, didn't pain

cease with death, didn't it go ... 

The night wet and windy, two children dressed as pumpkins waddling across the square and the 
shop windows covered in paper spiders, all the tawdry Muggle trappings of a world in which they 
did not believe ... And he was gliding along, that sense of purpose and power and rightness in him 
that he always knew on these occasions ... Not anger ... that was for weaker souls than he ... but 
triumph, yes ... He had waited for this, he had hoped for it ... 

"Nice costume, mister!" 

He saw the small boy's smile falter as he ran near enough to see beneath the hood of the cloak, 
saw the fear cloud his painted face. Then the child turned and ran away ... Beneath the robe he 
fingered the handle of his wand ... One simple movement and the child would never reach his 
mother ... but unnecessary, quite unnecessary... 

And along a new and darker street he moved, and now his destination was in sight at last, the 
Fidelius Charm broken, though they did not know it yet ... And he made less noise than the dead 
leaves, slithering along the pavement as he drew level with the dark hedge, and steered over it ... 

They had not drawn the curtains; he saw them quite clearly in their little sitting room, the tall 
black-haired man in his glasses, making puffs of colored smoke erupt from his wand for the 
amusement of the small black-haired boy in his blue pajamas. 

The child was laughing and trying to catch the smoke, to grab it in his small fist ... 

A door opened and the mother entered, saying words he could not hear, her long dark-red hair 
falling over her face. Now the father scooped up the son and handed him to the mother. He threw 
his wand down upon the sofa and stretched, yawning... 

The gate creaked a little as he pushed it open, but James Potter did not hear. His white hand 
pulled out the wand beneath his cloak and pointed it at the door, which burst open... 

He was over the threshold as James came sprinting into the hall. It was easy, too easy, he had 
not even picked up his wand ... 

"Lily, take Harry and go! It's him! Go! Run! I'll hold him off!" Hold him off, without a wand in 
his hand! ... He laughed before casting the curse ... 

"Avada Kedavra!" 

The green light filled the cramped hallway, it lit the pramӤ���� 
pushed against the wall, it

made the banisters glow like lighting rods, and James Potter fell like a marionetteǣ��ľżwhose 
strings were cut ... 

He could hear her screaming from the upper floor, trapped, but as long as she was sensible, 
she, at least, had nothing to fear ... 

He climbed the steps, listening with faint amusement to her attempts to barricade herself in ... 

She had no wand upon her either ... How stupid they were, and how trusting, thinking that their 

safety lay in friends, that weapons could be discarded even for moments... 

He forced the door open, cast aside the chair and boxes hastily piled against it with one lazy 
wave of his wand ... and there she stood, the child in her arms. At the sight of him, she dropped her 
son into the crib behind her and threw her arms wide, as if this would help, as if in shielding him 
from sight she hoped to be chosen instead ... 

"Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry!" 

"Stand aside, you silly girl... stand aside, now." 

"Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead..." 

"This is my last warning." 

"Not Harry! Please ... have mercy���� 
... have mercy ... Not Harry! Not Harry! Please -I'll do 
anything ...�� 

"Stand aside. Stand aside, girl!" 

He could have forced her away from the crib, but it seemed more prudent to finish them all ... 

The green light flashed around the room and she dropped like her husband. The child had not 
cried all this time. He could stand, clutching the bars of his crib, and he looked up into the 
intruder's face with a kind of bright interest, perhaps thinking that it was his father who hid 
beneath the cloak, making more pretty lights, and his mother would pop up any moment, laughing 
-

He pointed the wand very carefully into the boy's face. He wanted to see it happen, the 
destruction of this one inexplicable danger. The child began to cry. It had seen that he was not 
James. He did not like it crying, he had never been able to stomach (endure, tolerate) the small 
ones whining in the orphanage - 

"Avada Kedavra!" 

And then he broke. He was nothing, nothing but pain and terror, and he must hide himself, not

here in the rubble of the ruined house, where the child was trapped screaming, but far away ... far 
away ... 

"No," he moaned. 

The snake rustled on the filthy, cluttered floor, and he had killed the boy, and yet he was the boy 
... 

"No...�� 

And now he stood at the broken window of Bathilda's house, immersed in memories of his 
greatest loss, and at his feet the great snake slithered over broken china and glass... He looked 
down and saw something... something incredible... 

"No...�� 

"Harry, it's all right, you're all right!" 

He stooped down and picked up the smashed photograph. There he was, the unknown thief, the 
thief he was seeking... 

"No... I dropped it... I dropped it ...�� 

"Harry, it's okay, wake up, wake up!" 

He was Harry... Harry, not Voldemort ... and the thing that was rustling was not a snake ... He 
opened his eyes. 

"Harry," Hermione whispered. "Do you feel all - all right?" 

"Yes," he lied. 

He was in the tent, lying on one of the lower bunks beneath a heap of blankets. He could tell that 

it was almost dawn by the stillness and quality of the cold, flat light beyond the canvas ceiling. He 

was drenched in sweat; he could feel it on the sheets and blankets. 

"We got away." 

"Yes," said Hermione. "I had to use a Hover Charm to get you into your bunk. I couldn't lift 
you. You've been ... Well, you haven't been quite ...�� 

There were purple shadows under her brown eyes and he noticed a small sponge in her hand. 
She had been wiping his face. 

"You've been ill," she finished. "Quite ill." 

"How long ago did we leave?" 

"Hours ago. It's nearly morning."

"And I've been... what, unconscious?" 

"Not exactly," said Hermione uncomfortably. "You've been shouting and moaning and ... 
things," she added in a tone that made Harry feel uneasy. What had he done? Screamed curses like 
Voldemort, cried like the baby in the crib? 

"I couldn't get the Horcrux off you," Hermione said, and he knew she wanted to change the 
subject. "It was stuck, stuck to your chest. You've got a mark; I'm sorry, I had to use a Severing 
Charm to get it away. The snake hit you too, but I've cleaned the wound and put some dittany on 
it ...�� 

He pulled the sweaty T-shirt he was wearing away from himself and looked down. There was a 
scarlet oval over his heart where the locket had burned him. He could also see the half healed 
puncture marks to his forearm. 

"Where've you put the Horcrux?" 

"In my bag. I think we should keep it off for a while." 

He lay back on his pillows and looked into her pinched gray face. 

"We shouldn't have gone to Godric's Hollow. It's my fault, it's all my fault. Hermione, I'm 
sorry." 

"It's not you fault. I wanted to go too; I really thought Dumbledore might have left the sword 

there for you." 

"Yeah, well ... we got that wrong, didn't we?" 

"What happened, Harry? What happened when she took you upstairs? Was the snake hiding 

somewhere? Did it just come out and kill her and attack you?" 

"No." he said. "She was the snake ... or the snake was her ... all along." 

"W-what?" 

He closed his eyes. He could still smell Bathilda's house on him; it made the whole thing 
horribly vivid. 

"Bathilda must've been dead a while. The snake was ... was inside her. You-Know-Who put it 
there in Godric's Hollow, to wait. You were right. He knew I'd go back." 

"The snake was inside her?" 

He opened his eyes again. 

Hermione looked revolted, nauseated.

"Lupin said there would be magic we'd never imagined." Harry said. "She didn't want to talk in 
front of you, because it was Parseltongue, all Parseltongue, and I didn't realize, but of course I 
could understand her. Once we were up in the room, the snake sent a message to You-Know-Who, 
I heard it happen inside my head, I felt him get excited, he said to keep me there ... and then ...�� 

He remembered the snake coming out of Bathilda's neck, Hermione did not need to know the 

details. 

"... she changed, changed into the snake, and attacked." 

He looked down at the puncture marks. 

"It wasn't supposed to kill me, just keep me there till You-Know-Who came." 

If he had only managed to kill the snake, it would have been worth it, all of it ... Sick at heart, he 

sat up and threw back the covers. 

"Harry, no, I'm sure you ought to rest!" 

"You're the one who needs sleep. No offense, but you look terrible. I'm fine. I'll keep watch for a 

while. Where's my wand?" 

She did not answer, she merely looked at him. 

"Where's my wand, Hermione?" 

She was biting her lip, and tears swam in her eyes. "Harry ..." 

"Where's my wand?" 

She reached down beside the bed and held it out to him. 

The holly and phoenix wand was nearly severed in two. One fragile strand of phoenix feather 
kept both pieces hanging together. The wood had splintered apart completely. Harry took it into his 
hands as though it was a living thing that had suffered a terrible injury. He could not think 
properly. Everything was a blur of panic and fear. Then he held out the want to Hermione. "Mend 
it. Please." 

"Harry, I don't think, when it's broken like this -" 

"Please, Hermione, try!" 

"R-Reparo." 

The dangling half of the wand resealed itself. 

Harry held it up. "Lumos!" 

The wand sparked feebly, then went out. Harry pointed it at Hermione.

"Expelliarmus!" 

Hermione's wand gave a little jerk, but did not leave her hand. The feeble attempt at magic was 
too much for Harry's wand, which split into two again. He stared at it, aghast, unable to take in 
what he was seeing ... the wand that had survived so much ... 

"Harry." Hermione whispered so quietly he could hardly hear her. "I'm so, so sorry. I think it 
was me. As we were leaving, you know, the snake was coming for us, and so I cast a Blasting 
Curse, and it rebounded everywhere, and it must have - must have hit -" 

"It was an accident." said Harry mechanically. He felt empty, stunned. "We'll -we'll find a way 
to repair it." 

"Harry, I don't think we're going to be able to," said Hermione, the tears trickling down her face. 
"Remember ... remember Ron? When he broke his wand, crashing the car? It was never the same 
again, he had to get a new one." 

Harry thought of Ollivander, kidnapped and held hostage by Voldemort; of Gregorovitch, who 
was dead. How was he supposed to find himself a new wand? 

"Well," he said, in a falsely matter-of-fact voice, "well, I'll just borrow yours for now, then. 
While I keep watch." 

Her face glazed with tears, Hermione handed over her wand, and he left her sitting beside his 
bed, desiring nothing more than to get away from her.

Chapter Eighteen 

The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore 

The sun was coming up. The pure, colorless 


vastness of the 
sky stretched over him, indifferent to him and his 

suffering. Harry 
sat down in the tent entrance and took a deep 

breath of clean 
air. Simply to be alive to watch the sun rise over 

the sparkling 
snowy hillside ought to have been the greatest 

treasure on earth, 
yet he could not appreciate it. His senses had 

been spikedʹʧ
Ч 
by the calamity of losing his wand. He looked 

out over a valley 
blanketed in snow, distant church bells chiming 

through the 
glittering silence. 

Without realizing it, he was digging his fingers into his arms as if he were trying to resist 
physical pain. He had spilled his own blood more times than he could count; he had lost all bones 
in his right arm once; this journey had already given him scars to his chest and forearm to join 
those on his hand and forehead, but never, until this moment, had he felt himself to be fatally 
weakened, vulnerable, and naked, as though the best part of his magical power had been torn from 
him. He knew exactly what Hermione would say if he expressed any of this. The wand is only as 
good as the wizard. But she was wrong, his case was different. She had not felt the wand spin like 
the needle of a compass and shoot golden flames at his enemy. He had lost the protection of the 
twin cores, and only now that it was gone did he realize how much he had been counting on it. 

He pulled the pieces of the broken wand out of his pocket and, without looking at them, tucked 
them away in Hagrid��s pouch around his neck. The pouch was now too full of broken and useless 
objects to take any more. Harry��s hand brushed the old Snitch through the moleskin and for a 
moment he had to fight the temptation to pull it out and throw it away. Impenetrable, unhelpful, 
useless, like everything else Dumbledore had left behind. 

And his fury at Dumbledore broke over him now like lava, scorching him inside, wiping out 
every other feeling. Out of sheer desperation they had talked themselves into believing that 
Godric��s Hollow held answers, convinced themselves that they were supposed to go back, that it

��253ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

was all part of some secret path laid out for them by Dumbledore, but there was no map, no plan. 
Dumbledore had left them to grope in the darkness, to wrestle with unknown and undreamed-of 
terrors, alone and unaided. Nothing was explained, nothing was given freely, they had no sword, 
and now, Harry had no wand. And he had dropped the photograph of the thief, and it would surely 
be easy now for Voldemort to find out who he was ... 

Voldemort had all the information now ... 

��Harry?�� 

Hermione looked frightened that he might curse her with her own wand. Her face streaked with 
tears, she crouched down beside him, two cups of tea trembling in her hands and something bulky 

under her arm. 

��Thanks,�� he said, taking one of the cups. 

��Do you mind if I talk to you?�� 

��No,�� he said because he did not want to hurt her feelings. 

��Harry, you wanted to know who that man in the picture was. Well ... I��ve got the book.�� 

Timidly she pushed it onto his lap, a pristine copy of The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. 

��Where - how -?�� 

��It was in Bathilda��s sitting room, just lying there... This note was sticking out of the top of it.�� 

Hermione read the few lines of spiky, acid-green writing aloud. 

��'Dear Bally, Thanks for your help. Here��s a copy of the book, hope you like it. You said 

everything, even if you don��t remember it. Rita.' I think it must have arrived while the real Bathilda 

was alive, but perhaps she wasn��t in any fit state to read it.�� 

��No, she probably wasn��t.�� 

Harry looked down upon Dumbledore��s face and experienced a surge of savage pleasure. Now 
he would know all the things that Dumbledore had never thought it worth telling him, whether 
Dumbledore wanted him to or not. 

��You��re still really angry at me, aren��t you?�� said Hermione; he looked up to see fresh tears 
leaking out of her eyes, and knew that his anger must have shown in his face. 

��No,�� he said quietly. ��No, Hermione, I know it was an accident. You were trying to get us out 
of there alive, and you were incredible. I��d be dead if you hadn��t been there to help me.�� 

He tried to return her watery smile, then turned his attention to the book. Its spine was stiff; it

had clearly never been opened before. He riffled through the pages, looking for photographs. He 
came across the one he sought almost at once, the young Dumbledore and his handsome 
companion, roaring with laughter at some long-forgotten joke. Harry dropped his eyes to the 
caption. 

Albus Dumbledore, shortly after his mother��s death, 
With his friend Gellert Grindelwald. 


Harry gaped at the last word for several long moments. Grindelwald. His friend Grindelwald. 
He looked sideways at Hermione, who was still contemplating the name as though she could not 
believe her eyes. Slowly she looked up at Harry. 

��Grindelwald!�� 

Ignoring the remainder of the photographs, Harry searched the pages around them for a 
recurrence of that fatal name. He soon discovered it and read greedily, but became lost. It was 
necessary to go farther back to make sense of it all, and eventually he found himself at the start of 
a chapter entitled ��The Greater Good.�� Together, he and Hermione started to read: 

Now approaching his eighteenth birthday, Dumbledore left Hogwarts in a blaze of 
glory -Head Boy, Prefect, Winner of the Barnabus Finkley Prize for Exceptional Spell-
Casting, British Youth Representative to the Wizengamot, Gold Medal-Winner for 
Ground-Breaking Contribution to the International Alchemical Conference in Cairo. 
Dumbledore intended, next, to take a Grand Tour with Elphias ��Dogbreath�� Doge, the 
dim-witted but devoted sidekick he had picked up at school. 

The two young men were staying at the Leaky Cauldron in London, preparing to 
depart for Greece the following morning, when an owl arrived bearing news of 
Dumbledore��s mother��s death. ��Dogbreath�� Doge, who refused to be interviewed for this 
book, has given the public his own sentimental version of what happened next. He 
represents��� 
Kendra��s death as a tragic blow, and Dumbledore��s decision to give up 
his expedition as an act of noble self-sacrifice. 

Certainly Dumbledore returned to Godric��s Hollow at once, supposedly to "care" for 
his younger brother and sister. But how much care did he actually give them?

��255ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He were a head case����, that Aberforth,�� said Enid Smeek, whose family lived on 
the outskirts of Godric��s Hollow at that time. ��Ran wild. 'Course, with his mum and dad 
gone you��d have felt sorry for him, only he kept chucking goat dung at my head. I don��t 
think Albus was fussed about him. I never saw them together, anyway.�� 

So what was Albus doing, if not comforting his wild young brother? The answer, it 
seems, is ensuring the continued imprisonment of his sister. For though her first jailer had 
died, there was no change in the pitiful condition of Ariana Dumbledore. Her very 
existence continued to be known only to those few outsiders who, like ��Dogbreath�� 
Doge, could be counted upon to believe in the story of her "ill health". 

Another such easily satisfied friend of the family was Bathilda Bagshot, the celebrated 
magical historian who has lived in Godric��s Hollow for many years. Kendra, of course, 
had rebuffed Bathilda when she first attempted to welcome the family to the village. 
Several years later, however, the author sent an owl to Albus at Hogwarts, having been 
favorably impressed by his paper on trans-species transformation in Transfiguration 
Today. This initial contact led to acquaintance with the entire Dumbledore family. At the 
time of Kendra��s death, Bathilda was the only person in Godric��s Hollow who was on 
speaking terms with Dumbledore��s mother. 

Unfortunately, the brilliance that Bathilda exhibited earlier in her life has now 
dimmed. ��The fire��s lit, but the cauldron��s empty,�� as Ivor Dillonsby put it to me, or, in 
Enid Smeek��s slightly earthier phrase, ��She��s nutty as squirrel poo.�� Nevertheless, a 
combination of tried-and-tested reporting techniques enabled me to extract enough 
nuggets���� 
of hard fact to string together the whole scandalous story. 

Like the rest of the Wizarding world, Bathilda puts Kendra��s premature death down to 
a backfiring charm, a story repeated by Albus and Aberforth in later years. Bathilda also 
parrots the family line on Ariana, calling her ��frail�� and ��delicate.�� On one subject, 
however, Bathilda is well worth the effort I put into procuring Veritaserum, for she, and 
she alone, knows the full story of the best-kept secret of Albus Dumbledore��s life. Now 
revealed for the first time, it calls into question everything that his admirers believed of 
Dumbledore, his supposed hatred of the Dark Arts, his opposition into the oppression of

��256ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Muggles, even his devotion to his own family. 

The very same summer that Dumbledore went home to Godric��s Hollow, now an 

orphan and head of the family, Bathilda Bagshot agreed to accept into her home her 

great-nephewֶ��, Gellert Grindelwald. 

The name of Grindelwald is justly famous. In a list of Most Dangerous Dark Wizards 
of All Time, he would miss out on the top spot only because You-Know-Who arrived, a 
generation later, to steal his crown. As Grindelwald never extended his campaign of 
terror to Britain, however, the details of his rise to power are not widely known here. 

Educated at Durmstrang, a school famous even then for its unfortunate tolerance of the 
Dark Arts, Grindelwald showed himself quite as precociously brilliant as Dumbledore. 
Rather than channel his abilities into the attainment of awards and prizes, however, 
Gellert Grindelwald devoted himself no other pursuits. At sixteen years old, even 
Durmstrang felt it could no longer turn a blind eye to����the twisted experiments of 
Gellert Grindelwald, and he was expelled. 

Hitherto, all that has been known of Grindelwald��s next movements is that he ��traveled 
around for some months.�� It can now be revealed that Grindelwald chose to visit his 
great-aunt in Godric��s Hollow, and that there, intensely shocking though it will be for 
many to hear it, he struck up a close friendship with none other than Albus Dumbledore. 

��He seemed a charming boy to me,�� babbles Bathilda, ��whatever he became later. 

Naturally I introduced him to poor Albus, who was missing the company of lads his own 

age. The boys took to each other at once.�� 

They certainly did. Bathilda shows me a letter, kept by her that Albus Dumbledore sent 
Gellert Grindelwald in the dead of night. 

��Yes, even after they��d spent all day in discussion -both such brilliant young boys, 
they got on like a cauldron on fire -I��d sometimes hear an owl tapping at Gellert��s 
bedroom window, delivering a letter from Albus! An idea would have struck him and he 
had to let Gellert know immediately!�� 

And what ideas they were. Profoundly shocking though Albus Dumbledore��s fans will 

find it, here are the thoughts of their seventeen-year-old hero, as relayed to his new best 

friend. (A copy of the original letter may be seen on page 463.) 

��257ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Gellert - 

Your point about Wizard dominance being FOR THE MUGGLES�� OWN GOOD 
-this, I think, is the crucial point. Yes, we have been given power and yes, that 
power gives us the right to rule, but it also gives us responsibilities over the ruled. 
We must stress this point, it will be the foundation stone upon which we build. 
Where we are opposed, as we surely will be, this must be the basis of all our 
counter-arguments. We seize control FOR THE GREATER GOOD. And from this it 
follows that where we meet resistance, we must use only the force that is necessary 
and no more. (This was your mistake at Durmstrang! But I do not complain, 
because if you had not been expelled, we would never have met.) 

Albus 

Astonished and appalled though his many admirers will be, this letter constitutes proof 
that Albus Dumbledore once dreamed of overthrowing the Statute of Secrecy and 
establishing Wizard rule over Muggles. What a blow for those who have always 
portrayed Dumbledore as the Muggle-borns�� greatest champion! How hollow those 
speeches promoting Muggle rights seem in the light of this damning new evidence! How 
despicable does Albus Dumbledore appear, busy plotting his rise to power when he 
should have been mourning his mother and caring for his sister! 

No doubt those determined to keep Dumbledore on his crumbling pedestal will bleat 

that he did not, after all, put his plans into action, that he must have suffered a change of 

heart, that he came to his senses. However, the truth seems altogether more shocking. 

Barely two months into their great new friendship, Dumbledore and Grindelwald 
parted, never to see each other again until they met for their legendary duel (for more, see 
chapter 22). What caused this abrupt rupture? Had Dumbledore come to his senses? Had 
he told Grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans? Alas, no. 

��It was poor little Ariana dying, I think, that did it,�� says Bathilda. ��It came as an 

awful shock. Gellert was there in the house when it happened, and he came back to my 

house all of a dither (extreme agitation or excitement), told me he wanted to go home the

��258ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

next day. Terribly distressed, you know. So I arranged a Portkey and that was the last I 
saw of him. 

��Albus was beside himself at Ariana��s death. It was so dreadful for those two brothers. 
They had lost everybody except for each other. No wonder tempers ran a little high. 
Aberforth blamed Albus, you know, as people will under these dreadful circumstances. 
But Aberforth always talked a little madly, poor boy. All the same, breaking Albus��s nose 
at the funeral was not decent. It would have destroyed Kendra to see her sons fighting 
like that, across her daughter��s body. A shame Gellert could not have stayed for the 
funeral... He would have been a comfort to Albus, at least... 

This dreadful coffin-side brawl, known only to those few who attended Ariana 
Dumbledore��s funeral, raises several questions. Why exactly did Aberforth Dumbledore 
blame Albus for his sister��s death? Was it, as ��Batty�� pretends, a mere effusion of grief? 
Or could there have been some more concrete reason for his fury? Grindelwald, expelled 
from Durmstrang for the near-fatal attacks upon fellow students, fled the country hours 
after the girl��s death, and Albus (out of shame or fear?) never saw him again, not until 
forced to do so by the pleas of the Wizarding world. 

Neither Dumbledore nor Grindelwald ever seems to have referred to this brief boyhood 
friendship in later life. However, there can be no doubt that Dumbledore delayed, for 
some five years of turmoil, fatalities and disappearances, his attack upon Gellert 
Grindelwald. Was it lingering affection for the man or fear of exposure as his once best 
friend that caused Dumbledore to hesitate? Was it only reluctantly that Dumbledore set 
out to capture the man he was once so delighted he had met? 

And how did the mysterious Ariana die? Was she the inadvertent victim of some Dark 
rite? Did she stumble across something she ought not to have done, as the two young men 
sat practicing for their attempt at glory and domination? Is it possible that Ariana 
Dumbledore was the first person to die ��for the greater good��? 

The chapter ended here and Harry looked up. Hermione had reached the bottom of the page 
before him. She tugged the book out of Harry��s hands, looking a little alarmed by his expression,

��259ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and closed it without looking at it, as though hiding something indecent. 

��Harry -�� 

But he shook his head. Some inner certainty had crashed down inside him; it was exactly as he 
had felt after Ron left. He had trusted Dumbledore, believed him the embodiment of goodness and 
wisdom. All was ashes. How much more could he lose? Ron, Dumbledore, the phoenix wand ... 

��Harry.�� She seemed to have heard his thoughts. "Listen to me. It -it doesn't make a very nice 
reading -" 

"Yeah, you could say that -" 

"- but don't forget, Harry, this is Rita Skeeter writing." 

"You did read that letter to Grindelwald, didn't you?" 

"Yes, I -I did." She hesitated, looking upset, cradling her tea in her cold hands. "I think that's 
the worst bit. I know Bathilda thought it was all just talk, but 'For the Greater Good' became 
Grindelwald's slogan, his justification for all the atrocities he committed later. And ... from that ... 
it looks like Dumbledore gave him the idea. They say 'For the Greater Good' was even carved over 
the entrance to Nurmengard." 

"What's Nurmengard?" 

"The prison Grindelwald had built to hold his opponents. He ended up in there himself, once 
Dumbledore had caught him. Anyway, it's -it��s an awful thought that Dumbledore's ideas helped 
Grindelwald rise to power. But on the other hand, even Rita can't pretend that they knew each 
other for more than a few months one summer when they were both really young, and -" 

"I thought you'd say that," said Harry. He did not want to let his anger spill out at her, but it was 
hard to keep his voice steady. "I thought you'd say 'They were young.' They were the same age as 
we are now. And here we are, risking our lives to fight the Dark Arts, and there he was, in a huddle 
with his new best friend, plotting their rise to power over the Muggles." 

His temper would not remain in check much longer. He stood up and walked around, trying to 
work some of it off. 

"I'm not trying to defend what Dumbledore wrote," said Hermione. "All that 'right to rule' 
rubbish, it's 'Magic Is Might' all over again. But Harry, his mother had just died, he was stuck 
alone in the house -" 

"Alone? He wasn't alone! He had his brother and sister for company, his Squib sister he was

��260ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

keeping locked up -" 

"I don't believe it," said Hermione. She stood up too. "Whatever was wrong with that girl, I don't 
think she was a Squib. The Dumbledore we knew would never, ever have allowed -" 

"The Dumbledore we thought we knew didn't want to conquer Muggles by force!" Harry 
shouted, his voice echoing across the empty hilltop, and several blackbirds rose into the air, 
squawking and spiraling against the pearly sky. 

"He changed, Harry, he changed! It's as simple as that! Maybe he did believe these things when 
he was seventeen, but the whole of the rest of his life was devoted to fighting the Dark Arts! 
Dumbledore was the one who stopped Grindelwald, the one who always voted for Muggle 
protection and Muggle born rights, who fought You-Know-Who from the start, and who died 
trying to bring him down!" 

Rita's book lay on the ground between them, so that the face of Albus Dumbledore smiled 
dolefully at both. 

"Harry, I'm sorry, but I think the real reason you're so angry is that Dumbledore never told you 
any of this himself." 

"Maybe I am!" Harry bellowed, and he flung his arms over his head, hardly knowing whether he 
was trying to hold in his anger or protect himself from the weight of his own disillusionment. 
"Look what he asked from me, Hermione! Risk your life, Harry! And again! And again! And don't 
expect me to explain everything, just trust me blindly, trust that I know what I'm doing, trust me 
even though I don't trust you! Never the whole truth! Never!" 

His voice cracked with the strain, and they stood looking at each other in the whiteness and 

emptiness, and Harry felt they were as insignificant as insects beneath that wide sky. 

"He loved you," Hermione whispered. "I know he loved you." 

Harry dropped his arms. 

"I don't know who he loved, Hermione, but it was never me. This isn't love, the mess he's left 
me in. He shared a damn sight more of what he was really thinking with Gellert Grindelwald than 
he ever shared with me." 

Harry picked up Hermione's wand, which he had dropped in the snow, and sat back down in the 
entrance of the tent. 

"Thanks for the tea. I'll finish the watch. You get back in the warm."

��261ҳ��

She hesitated, but recognized the dismissal. She picked up the book and then walked back past 
him into the tent, but as she did so, she brushed the top of his head lightly with her hand. He closed 
his eyes at her touch, and hated himself for wishing that what she said was true, that Dumbledore 
had really cared.

The Silver Doe 


It was snowing by the time Hermione took over 


the watch at 
midnight. 
Harry's dreams were confused and disturbing: 

Nagini wove 
in and out of them, first through a gigantic, cracked 

ring, then 
through a wreath of Christmas roses. 
He woke repeatedly, panicky, convinced that 

somebody 
had called out to him in the distance, imagining that 

the wind 
whipping around the tent was footsteps or voices. 

Finally he got up in the darkness and joined Hermione, who was huddled in the entrance to the 
tent reading A History of Magic by the light of her wand. The snow was falling thickly, and she 
greeted with relief his suggestion of packing up early and moving on. 

"We'll go somewhere more sheltered," she agreed, shivering as she pulled on a sweatshirt over 
her pajamas. "I kept thinking I could hear people moving outside. I even though I saw somebody 
one or twice." 

Harry paused in the act of pulling on a jumper and glanced at the silent, motionless 
Sneakoscope on the table. 

"I'm sure I imagined it," said Hermione, looking nervous. "The snow in the dark, it plays tricks 
on your eyes. But perhaps we ought to Disapparate under the Invisibility Cloak, just in case?" 

Half an hour later, with the tent packed, Harry wearing the Horcrux, and Hermione clutching 
the beaded bag, they Disapparated. The usual tightness engulfed them; Harry's feet parted 
company with the snowy ground, then slammed hard onto what felt like frozen earth covered in 
leaves. 

"Where are we?" he asked, peering around at the fresh mass of trees as Hermione opened the 

beaded bag and began tugging out the tent poles. 

 "The Forest of Dean," she said, "I came camping here once with my mum and dad." 

Here too snow lay on the trees all around and it was bitterly cold, but they were at least 

protected from the wind. They spent most of the day inside the tent, huddled for warmth around

the useful bright blue flames that Hermione was adept at producing, and which could be scooped 
up and carried in a jar. Harry felt as though he was recuperating from some brief but severe illness, 
an impression reinforced by Hermione's solicitousness (concern; great care). That afternoon fresh 
flakes drifted down upon them, so that even their sheltered clearing had a fresh dusting of powdery 
snow. 

After two nights of little sleep, Harry's senses seemed more alert than usual. Their escape from 
Godric's Hollow had been so narrow that Voldemort seemed somehow closer than before, more 
threatening. As darkness drove in again Harry refused Hermione's offer to keep watch and told her 
to go to bed. 

Harry moved an old cushion into the tent mouth and sat down, wearing all the sweaters he 
owned but even so, still shivery. The darkness deepened with the passing hours until it was 
virtually impenetrable. He was on the point of taking out the Marauder's Map, so as to watch 
Ginny's dot for a while, before he remembered that it was the Christmas holidays and that she 
would be back at the Burrow. 

Every tiny movement seemed magnified in the vastness of the forest. Harry knew that it must 
be full of living creatures, but he wished they would all remain still and silent so that he could 
separate their innocent scurryings and prowlings from noises that might proclaim other sinister 
movements. He remembered the sound of a cloak slithering over dead leaves many years ago, and 
at once thought he heard it again before mentally shaking himself. Their protective enchantments 
had worked for weeks; why should they break now? And yet he could no throw off the feeling that 
something was different tonight. 

Several times he jerked upright, his neck aching because he had fallen asleep, slumped at an 
awkward angle against the side of the tent. The night reached such a depth of velvety blackness 
that he might have been suspended in limbo between Disapparation and Apparation. He had just 
held a hand in front of his face to see whether he could make out his fingers when it happened. 

A bright silver light appeared right ahead of him, moving through the trees. Whatever the 
source, it was moving soundlessly. The light seemed simply to drift toward him. 

He jumped to his feet, his voice frozen in his throat, and raised Hermione's wand. He screwed 
up his eyes as the light became blinding, the trees in front of it pitch black in silhouette, and still

��264ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

the thing came closer. 

And then the source of the light stepped out from behind an oak. It was a silver white doe, 
moon-bright and dazzling, picking her way over the ground, still silent, and leaving no hoofprints 
in the fine powdering of snow. She stepped toward him, her beautiful head with its wide, long-
lashed eyes held high. 

Harry stared at the creature, filled with wonder, not at her strangeness, but her inexplicable 
familiarity. He felt that he had been waiting for her to come, but that he had forgotten, until this 
moment, that they had arranged to meet. His impulse to shout for Hermione, which had been so 
strong a moment ago, had gone. He knew, he would have staked his life on it, that she had come 
for him, and him alone.

 They gazed at each other for several long moments and then she turned and walked away.

 "No," he said, and his voice was cracked with lack of use. "Come back!" 

She continued to step deliberately through the trees, and soon her brightness was striped by 
their thick black trunks. For one trembling second he hesitated. Caution murmured it could be a 
trick, a lure, a trap. But instinct, overwhelming instinct, told him that this was not Dark Magic. He 
set off in pursuit. 

Snow crunched beneath his feet, but the doe made no noise as she passed through the trees, for 
she was nothing but light. Deeper and deeper into the forest she led him, and Harry walked 
quickly, sure that when she stopped, she would allow him to approach her properly. And then she 
would speak and the voice would tell him what he needed to know. 

At last she came to a halt. She turned her beautiful head toward him once more, and he broke 
into a run, a question burning in him, but as he opened his lips to ask it, she vanished. 

Though the darkness had swallowed her whole, her burnished image was still imprinted on his 
retinas; it obscured his vision, brightening when he lowered his eyelids, disorienting him. Now fear 
came, her presence had meant safety.

 "Lumos!" he whispered, and the wand-tip ignited. 

The imprint of the doe faded away with every blink of his eyes as he stood there, listening to 
the sounds of the forest, to distant crackles of twigs, soft swishes of snow. Was he about to be 
attacked? Had she enticed him into an ambush? Was he imagining that somebody stood beyond the 
reach of the wandlight, watching him?

He held the wand higher. Nobody ran out at him, no flash of green light burst from behind a 
tree. Why, then, had she led him to this spot? 

Something gleamed in the light of the wand, and Harry spun about, but all that was there was a 
small, frozen pool, its black, cracked surface glittering as he raised his wand higher to examine it. 

He moved forward rather cautiously and looked down. The ice reflected his distorted shadow 
and the beam of wandlight, but deep below the thick, misty gray carapace�׿� 
,��, something else 
glinted. A great silver cross... 

His heart skipped into his mouth, He dropped to his knees at the pool's edge and angled the 
wand so as to flood the bottom of the pool with as much light as possible. A glint of deep red... It 
was a sword with glittering rubies in its hilt.The sword of Gryffindor was lying at the bottom of the 
forest pool. 

Barely breathing, he stared down at it. How was this possible? How could it have come to be 
lying in a forest pool, this close to the place where they were camping? Had some unknown magic 
drawn Hermione to this spot, or was the doe, which he had taken to be a Patronus, some kind of 
guardian of the pool? Or had the sword been put into the pool after they had arrived, precisely 
because they were here? In which case, where was the person who wanted to pass it to Harry? 
Again he directed the wand at the surrounding trees and bushes, searching for a human outline, for 
the glint of an eye, but he could not see anyone there. All the same, a little more fear leavened (2. 
influence, change) his exhilaration as he returned his attention to the sword reposing upon the 
bottom of the frozen pool.

 He pointed the wand at the silvery shape and murmured, "Accio Sword." 

It did not stir. He had not expected it to. If it had been that easy the sword would have lain on 
the ground for him to pick up, not in the depths of a frozen pool. He set off around the circle of ice, 
thinking hard about the last time the sword had delivered itself to him. He had been in terrible 
danger then, and had asked for help.

 "Help," he murmured, but the sword remained upon the pool bottom, indifferent, motionless. 

What was it, Harry asked himself (walking again), that Dumbledore had told him the last time 
he had retrieved the sword? Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat. And what 
were the qualities that defined a Gryffindor? A small voice inside Harry's head answered him, 
Their daring nerve and chivalry set Gryffindor apart.

Harry stopped walking and let out a long sigh, his smoky breath dispersing rapidly upon the 
frozen air. He knew what he had to do. If he was honest with himself, he had thought it might 
come to this from the moment he had spotted the sword through the ice. 

He glanced around at the surrounding trees again, but was convinced now that nobody was 
going to attack him. They had had their chance as he walked alone through the forest, had had 
plenty of opportunity as he examined the pool. The only reason to delay at this point was because 
the immediate prospect was so deeply uninviting. 

With fumbling fingers Harry started to remove his many layers of clothing. Where "chivalry" 
entered into this, he thought ruefully, he was not entirely sure, unless it counted as chivalrous that 
he was not calling for Hermione to do it in his stead. 

An owl hooted somewhere as he stripped off, and he thought with a pang of Hedwig. He was 
shivering now, his teeth chattering horribly, and yet he continued to strip off until at last he stood 
there in his underwear, barefooted in the snow. He placed the pouch containing his wand, his 
mother's letter, the shard of Sirius's mirror, and the old Snitch on top of his clothes, then he pointed 
Hermione's wand at the ice. 

"Diffindo." 

It cracked with a sound like a bullet in the silence. The surface of the pool broke and chunks of 
dark ice rocked on the ruffled water. As far as Harry could judge, it was not deep, but to retrieve 
the sword he would have to submerge himself completely. 

Contemplating the task ahead would not make it easier or the water warmer. He stepped to the 
pool's edge and placed Hermione's wand on the ground still lit. Then, trying not to imagine how 
much colder he was about to become or how violently he would soon be shivering, he jumped. 

Every pore of his body screamed in protest. The very air in his lungs seemed to freeze solid as 
he was submerged to his shoulders in the frozen water. He could hardly breathe, trembling so 
violently the water lapped over the edges of the pool, he felt for the blade with his numb feet. He 
only wanted to dive once. 

Harry put off the moment of total submersion from second to second, gasping and shaking, 
until he told himself that it must be done, gathered all his courage, and dived. 

The cold was agony, it attacked him like fire. His brain itself seemed to have frozen as he 
pushed through the dark water to the bottom and reached out, groping for the sword. His fingers

��267ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

closed around the hilt; he pulled it upward. 

Then something closed tight around his neck. He thought of water weeds, though nothing had 
brushed him as he dived, and raised his hand to free himself. It was not weed, The chain of the 
Horcrux had tightened and was slowly constricting his windpipe. 

Harry kicked out wildly, trying to push himself back to the surface, but merely propelled 
himself into the rocky side of the pool. Thrashing, suffocating, he scrabbled at the strangling chain, 
his frozen fingers unable to loosen it, and now little lights were popping inside his head, and he 
was going to drown, there was nothing left, nothing he could do, and the arms that closed around 
his chest were surely Death's. 

Choking and retching, soaking and colder than he had ever been in his life, he came to 
facedown in the snow. Somewhere, close by, another person was panting and coughing and 
staggering around, Hermione had come again, as she had come when the snake attacked... 

Yet it did not sound like her, not with those deep coughs, no judging by the weight of the 
footsteps. 

Harry had no strength to lift his head and see his savior's identity. All he could do was raise a 
shaking hand to his throat and feel the place where the locket had cut tightly into his flesh. It was 
gone. Someone had cut him free. Then a panting voice spoke from over his head.

 "Are - you - mental?" 

Nothing but the shock of hearing that voice could have given Harry the strength to get up. 
Shivering violently, he staggered to his feet. There before him stood Ron, fully dressed but 
drenched to the skin, his hair plastered to his face, the sword of Gryffindor in one hand and the 
Horcrux dangling from its broken chain in the other. 

"Why the hell," panted Ron, holding up the Horcrux, which swung backward and forward on its 
shortened chain in some parody of hypnosis, "didn't you take the thing off before you dived?" 

Harry could not answer. The silver doe was nothing, nothing compared with Ron's 
reappearance; he could not believe it. Shuddering with cold, he caught up the pile of clothes still 
lying at the water's edge and began to pull them on. As he dragged sweater after sweater over his 
head, Harry stared at Ron, half expecting him to have disappeared every time he lost sight of him, 
and yet he had to be real. He had just dived into the pool, he had saved Harry's life. 

"It was y-you?" Harry said at last, his teeth chattering, his voice weaker than usual due to his

��268ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

near-strangulation.

 "Well, yeah," said Ron, looking slightly confused. 

 "Y-you cast that doe?" 

 "What? No, of course not! I thought it was you doing it!" 

 "My Patronus is a stag." 

 "Oh yeah. I thought it looked different. No antlers." 

Harry put Hagrid's pouch back around his neck, pulled on a final sweater, stooped to pick up 

Hermione's wand, and faced Ron again.

 "How come you're here?" 

 Apparently Ron had hoped that this point would come up later, if at all. 

"Well, I've -you know -I've come back. If -" He cleared his throat. "-you know, you still want 
me." 

There was a pause, in which the subject of Ron's departure seemed to rise like a wall between 
them. Yet he was here. He had returned. He had just saved Harry's life. 

Ron looked down at his hands. He seemed momentarily surprised to see the things he was 
holding. 

"Oh yeah, I got it out," he said, rather unnecessarily, holding up the sword for Harry's 
inspection. "That's why you jumped in, right?" 

 "Yeah," said Harry. "But I don't understand. How did you get here? How did you find us?" 

"Long story," said Ron. "I've been looking for you for hours, it's a big forest, isn't it? And I was 

just thinking I'd have to go kip (British) sleep) under a tree and wait for morning when I saw that 

deer coming and you following."

 "You didn't see anyone else?" 

 "No," said Ron. "I -" 

 But he hesitated, glancing at two trees growing close together some yards away. 

"I did think I saw something move over there, but I was running to the pool at the time, because 

you'd gone in and you hadn't come up, so I wasn't going to make a detour to - hey!" 

Harry was already hurrying to the place that Ron had indicated. The two oaks grew close 
together; there was a gap of only a few inches between the trunks at eye level, an ideal place to see 
but not be seen. The ground around the roots, however, was free of snow, and Harry could see no

��269ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sign of footprints. He walked back to where Ron stood waiting, still holding the sword and the 

Horcrux. 

 "Anything there?" Ron asked. 

 "No," said Harry.

 "So how did the sword get in that pool?" 

 "Whoever cast the Patronus must have put it there." 

They both looked at the ornate silver sword, its rubied hilt glinting a little in the light from 

Hermione's wand. 

 "You reckon this is the real one?" asked Ron. 

 "One way to find out, isn't there?" said Harry. 

The Horcrux was still swinging from Ron's hand. The locket was twitching slightly. Harry 
knew that the thing inside it was agitated again. It had sensed the presence of the sword and had 
tried to kill Harry rather than let him possess it. Now was not the time for long discussions; now 
was the moment to destroy once and for all. Harry looked around, holding Hermione's wand high, 
and saw the place, a flattish rock lying in the shadow of a sycamore tree. 

"Come here." he said and he led the way, brushed snow from the rock's surface, and held out 

his hand for the Horcrux. When Ron offered the sword, however, Harry shook his head. 

 "No, you should do it." 

 "Me?" said Ron, looking shocked. "Why?"

 "Because you got the sword out of the pool. I think it's supposed to be you." 

He was not being kind or generous. As certainly as he had known that the doe was benign, he 
knew that Ron had to be the one to wield the sword. Dumbledore had at least taught Harry 
something about certain kinds of magic, of the incalculable power of certain acts. 

"I'm going to open it," said Harry, "and you will stab it. Straightaway okay? Because whatever's 
in there will put up a fight. The bit of Riddle in the Diary tried to kill me."

 "How are you going to open it?" asked Ron. He looked terrified 

"I'm going to ask it to open, using Parseltongue," said Harry. The answer came so readily to his 
lips that he thought he had always known it deep down. Perhaps it had taken his recent encounter 
with Nagini to make him realize it. He looked at the serpentine S, inlaid with glittering green 
stones. It was easy to visualize it as a miniscule snake, curled upon the cold rock. 

��270ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"No!" said Ron. "Don't open it! I'm serious!" 

 "Why not?" asked Harry. "Let's get rid of the damn thing, it's been months -" 

 "I can't, Harry, I'm serious. You do it." 

 "But why?" 

"Because that thing's bad for me!" said Ron, backing away from the locket on the rock. "I can't 
handle it! I'm not making excuses, Harry, for what I was like, but it affects me worse than it affects 
you and Hermione, it made me think stuff -stuff that I was thinking anyway, but it made 
everything worse. I can't explain it, and then I'd take it off and I'd get my head straight again, and 
then I'd have to put the effing thing back on - I can't do it Harry!"

 He had backed away, the sword dragging at his side, shaking his head. 

 "You can do it," said Harry, "you can! You've just got the sword. I know it's supposed to be you 
who uses it. Please just get rid of it, Ron." 

The sound of his name seemed to act like a stimulant. Ron swallowed, then still breathing hard 
through his long nose, moved back toward the rock. 

 "Tell me when," he croaked. 

"On three," said Harry, looking back down at the locket and narrowing his eyes, concentrating 

on the letter S, imagining a serpent, while the contents of the locket rattled like a trapped 

cockroach. It would have been easy to pity it, except that the cut around Harry's neck still burned. 

 "One ... two ... three ... open." 

The last word came as a hiss and a snarl and the golden doors of the locket swung wide open 
with a little click. 

Behind both of the glass windows within blinked a living eye, dark and handsome as Tom 
Riddle's eyes had been before he turned them scarlet and slit-pupiled

 "Stab," said Harry, holding the locket steady on the rock. 

Ron raised the sword in his shaking hands. The point dangled over the frantically swiveling 

eyes, and Harry gripped the locket tightly, bracing himself, already imagining blood pouring from 

the empty windows. 

 Then a voice hissed from out the Horcrux. 

"I have seen your heart, and it is mine." 

 "Don't listen to it!" Harry said harshly. "Stab it!" 

��271ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your fears. All you desire is 
possible, but all that you dread is also possible." 

"Stab!" shouted Harry, his voice echoed off the surrounding trees, the sword point trembled, 
and Ron gazed down into Riddle's eyes. 

"Least loved, always, by the mother who craved a daughter ... Least loved, now, by the girl who 
prefers your friend ... Second best (2. not of the best quality), always, eternally overshadowed ...�� 

"Ron, stab it now!" Harry bellowed, He could feel the locket quivering in the grip and was 
scared of what was coming. Ron raised the sword still higher, and as he did so, Riddle's eyes 
gleamed scarlet. 

Out of the locket's two windows, out of the eyes, there bloomed like two grotesque bubbles, the 
heads of Harry and Hermione, weirdly distorted. 

Ron yelled in shock and backed away as the figures blossomed out of the locket, first chests, 
then waists, then legs, until they stood in the locket, side by side like trees with a common root, 
swaying over Ron and the real Harry, who had snatched his fingers away from the locket as it 
burned, suddenly, white-hot. 

"Ron!" he shouted, but the Riddle-Harry was now speaking with Voldemort's voice and Ron 
was gazing, mesmerized, into its face. 

"Why return? We were better without you, happier without you, glad of your absence. We 
laughed at your stupidity, your cowardice, your presumption -" 

"Presumption!" echoed the Riddle-Hermione, who was more beautiful and yet more terrible 
than the real Hermione. She swayed, cackling, before Ron, who looked horrified, yet transfixed, 
the sword hanging pointlessly at his side. "Who could look at you, who would ever look at you, 
beside Harry Potter? What have you ever done, compared with the Chosen One? What are you, 
compared with the Boy Who Lived?" 

"Ron, stab it, STAB IT!" Harry yelled, but Ron did not move. His eyes were wide, and the 
Riddle-Harry and the Riddle-Hermione were reflected in them, their hair swirling like flames, their 
eyes shining red, their voices lifted in an evil duet���س�/��. 

"Your mother confessed," sneered Riddle-Harry, while Riddle-Hermione jeered, "that she would 
have preferred me as a son, would be glad to exchange...�� 

"Who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to

him," crooned Riddle-Hermione, and she stretched like a snake and entwined herself around 
Riddle-Harry, wrapping him in a close embrace. Their lips met. 

On the ground in front of them, Ron's face filled with anguish. he raised the sword high, his 
arms shaking.

 "Do it, Ron!" Harry yelled.

 Ron looked toward him, and Harry thought he saw a trace of scarlet in his eyes.

 "Ron -?" 

The sword flashed, plunged, Harry threw himself out of the way, there as a clang of metal and a 
long, drawn-out scream. Harry whirled around, slipping in the snow, wand held ready to defend 
himself, but there was nothing to fight. 

The monstrous versions of himself and Hermione were gone. There was only Ron, standing 
there with the sword held slackly in his hand, looking down at the shattered remains of the locket 
on the flat rock. 

Slowly, Harry walked back to him, hardly knowing what to say or do. Ron was breathing 
heavily. His eyes were no longer red at all, but their normal blue, they were also wet. 

Harry stooped, pretending he had not seen, and picked up the broken Horcrux. Ron had pierced 
the glass in both windows, Riddle's eyes were gone, and the stained silk lining of the locket was 
smoking slightly. The thing that had lived in the Horcrux had vanished, torturing Ron had been its 
final act. The sword clanged as Ron dropped it. He had sunk to his knees, his head in his arms. He 
was shaking, but not, Harry realized, from cold. Harry crammed the broken locket into his pocket, 
knelt down beside Ron, and placed a hand cautiously on his shoulder. He took it as a good sign 
that Ron did not throw it off. 

"After you left," he said in a low voice, grateful for the fact that Ron's face was hidden, "she 
cried for a week. Probably longer, only she didn't want me to see. There were loads of nights when 
we never even spoke to each other. With you gone...�� 

He could not finish; it was now that Ron was here again that Harry fully realized how much his 
absence had cost them. 

"She's like my sister," he went on. "I love her like a sister and I reckon that she feels the same 
way about me. It's always been like that. I thought you knew." 

Ron did not respond, but turned his face away from Harry and wiped his nose noisily on his

sleeve. Harry got to his feet again and walked to where Ron's enormous rucksack lay yards away, 
discarded as Ron had run toward the pool to save Harry from drowning. He hoisted it onto his own 
back and walked back to Ron, who clambered to his feet as Harry approached, eyes bloodshot but 
otherwise composed. 

"I'm sorry," he said in a thick voice. "I'm sorry I left. I know I was a - a -" 

He looked around at the darkness, as if hoping a bad enough word would swoop down upon him 
and claim him. 

"You've sort of made up for it tonight," said Harry. "Getting the sword. Finishing off the 
Horcrux. Saving my life." 

"That makes me sound a lot cooler than I was," Ron mumbled. 

"Stuff like that always sounds cooler than it really was" said Harry. "I've been trying to tell you 
that for years." 

Simultaneously they walked forward and hugged, Harry gripping the still-sopping back of Ron's 
jacket. 

"And now," said Harry as they broke apart, "all we've got to do is find that tent again." 

But it was not difficult. Though the walk through the dark forest with the doe had seemed 
lengthy, with Ron by his side, the journey back seemed to take a surprisingly short time. Harry 
could not wait to wake Hermione, and it was with quickening excitement that he entered the tent, 
Ron lagging a little behind him. 

It was gloriously warm after the pool and the forest, the only illumination the bluebell flames 
still shimmering in a bowl on the floor. Hermione was fast asleep, curled up under her blankets, 
and did not move until Harry had said her name several times.

 "Hermione!" 

She stirred, then sat up quickly, pushing her hair out of her face. 

"What's wrong? Harry? Are you all right?" 

"It's okay, everything's fine. More than fine, I'm great. There's someone here." 

"What do you mean? Who -?" 

She saw Ron, who stood there holding the sword and dripping onto the threadbare carpet. Harry 
backed into a shadowy corner, slipped off Ron's rucksack, and attempted to blend in with the 
canvas.

Hermione slid out of her bunk and moved like a sleepwalker toward Ron, her eyes upon his pale 
face. She stopped right in front of him, her lips slightly parted, her eyes wide. Ron gave a weak 
hopeful smile and half raised his arms. 

Hermione launched herself forward and started punching every inch of him that she could 

reach. 

"Ouch - ow - gerroff! What the -? Hermione - OW!" 

"You - complete - arse - Ronald - Weasley!" 

She punctuated every word with a blow, Ron backed away, shielding his head as Hermione 

advanced. 

"You - crawl - back - here - after - weeks - and - weeks - oh, where's my wand?" 

She looked as though ready to wrestle it out of Harry's hands and he reacted instinctively. 

"Protego!" 

The invisible shield erupted between Ron and Hermione. The force of it knocked her backward 

onto the floor. Spitting hair out of her mouth, she lept up again. 

 "Hermione!" said Harry. "Calm -" 

"I will not calm down!" she screamed. Never before had he seen her lose control like this; she 

looked quite demented. "Give me back my wand! Give it back to me!" 

"Hermione, will you please -" 

"Don't you tell me what do, Harry Potter!" she screeched. "Don't you dare! Give it back now! 
And YOU!" 

She was pointing at Ron in dire accusation. It was like a malediction���� 
, and Harry could not 
blame Ron for retreating several steps. 

"I came running after you! I called you! I begged you to come back" 

"I know," Ron said, "Hermione, I'm sorry, I'm really -" 

"Oh, you're sorry!" 

She laughed a high-pitched, out-of-control sound; Ron looked at Harry for help, but Harry 
merely grimaced his helplessness. 

"You came back after weeks -weeks -and you think it's all going to be all right if you just say 
sorry?" 

"Well, what else can I say?" Ron shouted, and Harry was glad that Ron was fighting back.

"Oh, I don't know!" yelled Hermione with awful sarcasm. "Rack your brains, Ron, that should 

only take a couple of seconds -" 

"Hermione," interjected Harry, who considered this a low blow, "he just saved my -" 

"I don't care!" she screamed. "I don't care what he's done! Weeks and weeks, we could have 

been dead for all he knew -" 

"I knew you weren't dead!" bellowed Ron, drowning her voice for the first time, and 
approaching as close as he could with the Shield Charm between them. "Harry's all over the 
Prophet, all over the radio, they're looking for you everywhere, all these rumors and mental 
stories, I knew I'd hear straight off if you were dead, you don't know what it's been like -" 

 "What it's been like for you?? 

Her voice was not so shrill only bats would be able to hear it soon, but she had reached a level 
of indignation that rendered her temporarily speechless, and Ron seized his opportunity. 

"I wanted to come back the minute I'd Disapparated, but I walked straight into a gang of 
Snatchers, Hermione, and I couldn't go anywhere!" 

"A gang of what?" asked Harry, as Hermione threw herself down into a chair with her arms and 
legs crossed so tightly it seemed unlikely that she would unravel them for several years. 

"Snatchers," said Ron. "They're everywhere -gangs trying to earn gold by rounding up Muggleborns 
and blood traitors, there's a reward from the Ministry for everyone captured. I was on my 
own and I look like I might be school age; they got really excited, thought I was a Muggle-born in 
hiding. I had to talk fast to get out of being dragged to the Ministry." 

"What did you say to them?" 

"Told them I was Stan Shunpike. First person I could think of." "And they believed that?" 

"They weren't the brightest. One of them was definitely part 
troll, the smell of him." 

Ron glanced at Hermione, clearly hopeful she might soften at this small instance of humor, but 
her expression remained stony above her tightly knotted limbs. 

"Anyway, they had a row about whether I was Stan or not. It was a bit pathetic to be honest, but 
there were still five of them and only one of me, and they'd taken my wand. Then two of them got 
into a fight and while the others were distracted I managed to hit the one holding me in the 
stomach, grabbed his wand, Disarmed the bloke holding mine, and Disapparated. I didn't do it so

well. Splinched myself again -" Ron held up his right hand to show two missing fingernails, 
Hermione raised her eyebrows coldly "-and I came out miles from where you were. By the time I 
got back to that bit of riverbank where we'd been ... you were gone." 

"Gosh, what a gripping story," Hermione said in the lofty voice she adopted when wishing to 
wound. "You must have been simply terrified. Meanwhile we went to Godric's Hollow and, let's 
think, what happened there, Harry? Oh yes, You-Know-Who's snake turned up, it nearly killed 
both of us, and then You-Know-Who himself arrived and missed us by about a second." 

"What?" Ron said, gaping from her to Harry, but Hermione ignored him.

 "Imagine losing fingernails, Harry! That really puts our sufferings into perspective, doesn't it?" 

"Hermione," said Harry quietly, "Ron just saved my life." 

She appeared not to have heard him. 

"One thing I would like to know, though," she said, fixing her eyes on a spot a foot over Ron's 
head. "How exactly did you find us tonight? That's important. Once we know, we'll be able to 
make sure we're not visited by anyone else we don't want to see." 

Ron glared at her, then pulled a small silver object from his jeans pocket. "This." 

 She had to look at Ron to see what he was showing them.

 "The Deluminator?" she asked, so surprised she forgot to look cold and fierce. 

"It doesn't just turn the lights on and off," said Ron. "I don't know how it works or why it 
happened then and not any other time, because I've been wanting to come back ever since I left. 

But I was listening to the radio really early on Christmas morning and I heard ... I heard you." 

He was looking at Hermione. 

"You heard me on the radio?" she asked incredulously. 

"No, I heard you coming out of my pocket. Your voice," he held up the Deluminator again, 
"came out of this." 

"And what exactly did I say?" asked Hermione, her tone somewhere between skepticism and 
curiosity. 

"My name. 'Ron.' And you said ... something about a wand." 

Hermione turned a fiery shade of scarlet. Harry remembered, it had been the first time Ron's 
name had been said aloud by either of them since the day he had left. Hermione had mentioned it 
when talking about repairing Harry's wand. 

��277ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"So I took it out," Ron went on, looking at the Deluminator, "and it didn't seem different or 
anything, but I was sure I'd heard you. So I clicked it. And the light went out in my room, but 
another light appeared right outside the window." 

Ron raised his empty hand and pointed in front of him, his eyes focused on something neither 
Harry nor Hermione could see. 

"It was a ball of light, kind of pulsing, and bluish, like that light you get around a Portkey, you 
know?" 

"Yeah," said Harry and Hermione together automatically. 

"I knew this was it," said Ron. "I grabbed my stuff and packed it, then I put on my rucksack and 
went out into the garden. 

"The little ball of light was hovering there, waiting for me, and when I came out it bobbed along 
a bit and I followed it behind the shed and then it ... well, it went inside me." 

"Sorry?" said Harry, sure he had not heard correctly. 

"It sort of floated toward me," said Ron, illustrating the movement with his free index finger, 
"right to my chest, and then - it just went straight through. It was here," he touched a point close to 
his heart, "I could feel it, it was hot. And once it was inside me, I knew what I was supposed to do. 
I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came out on the side of a 
hill. There was snow everywhere." 

"We were there," said Harry. "We spent two nights there, and the second night I kept thinking I 
could hear someone moving around in the dark and calling out!" 

"Yeah, well, that would've been me," said Ron. "Your protective spells work, anyway, because I 
couldn't see you and I couldn't hear you. I was sure you were around, though, so in the end I got in 
my sleeping bag and waited for one of you to appear. I thought you'd have to show yourselves 
when you packed up the tent." 

"No, actually," said Hermione. "We've been Disapparating under the Invisibility Cloak as an 
extra precaution. And we left really early, because as Harry says, we'd heard somebody blundering 
around." 

"Well, I stayed on that hill all day," said Ron. "I kept hoping you'd appear. But when it started to 
get dark I knew I must have missed you, so I clicked the Deluminator again, the blue light came 
out and went inside me, and I Disapparated and arrived here in these woods. I still couldn't see

you, so I just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end -and Harry did. Well, I 

saw the doe first, obviously." 

"You saw the what?" said Hermione sharply. 

They explained what had happened and as the story of the silver doe and the sword in the pool 
unfolded, Hermione frowned from one to the other of them, concentrating so hard she forgot to 
keep her limbs locked together. 

"But it must have been a Patronus!" she said. "Couldn't you see who was casting it? Didn't you 
see anyone? And it led you to the sword! I can't believe this! Then what happened?" 

Ron explained how he had watched Harry jump into the pool, and had waited for him to 
resurface; how he had realized that something was wrong, dived in and saved Harry, then returned 
for the sword. He got as far as the opening of the locket, then hesitated, and Harry cut in. 

"- and Ron stabbed it with the sword." 

"And ... and it went? Just like that?" she whispered. 

"Well, it - it screamed," said Harry with half a glance at Ron. "Here." 

He threw the locket into her lap; gingerly she picked it up and examined its punctured windows. 

Deciding that it was at last safe to do so, Harry removed the Shield Charm with a wave of 
Hermione's wand and turned to Ron. "Did you just say now that you got away from the snatchers 

with a spare wand?" 

"What?" said Ron, who had been watching Hermione examining the locket. "Oh - oh yeah." 

He tugged open a buckle on his rucksack and pulled a short dark wand out of his pocket. "Here, 

I figured it's always handy to have a backup." 

"You were right," said Harry, holding out his hand. "Mine's broken." 

"You're kidding?" Ron said, but at that moment Hermione got to her feet, and he looked 
apprehensive again. 

Hermione put the vanquished Horcrux into the beaded bag, then climbed back into her bed and 
settled down without another word. 

Ron passed Harry the new wand. 

"About the best you could hope for, I think," murmured Harry. 

"Yeah," said Ron. "Could've been worse. Remember those birds she set on me?" 

"I still haven't ruled it out," came Hermione's muffled voice from beneath her blankets, but

Chapter Twenty

Harry had not expected Hermione's anger

remorse. In fact, when all three of them were

with Harry, 

however (collecting water and searching the undergrowth for mushrooms), Ron became 
shamelessly cheery. 

"Someone helped us," he kept saying, "Someone sent that doe, Someone's on our side, One 
Horcrux down, mate!" 

Bolstered by the destruction of the locket they set to debating the possible locations of the other 
Horcruxes even though they had discussed the matter so often before. Harry felt optimistic, certain 
that more breakthroughs would succeed the first. Hermione's sulkiness could not mar his buoyant 
spirits. The sudden upswing in their fortunes, the appearance of the mysterious doe, the recovery 
of Gryffindor��s sword, and above all, Ron's return made Harry so happy that it was quite difficult 
to maintain a straight face. 

Late in the afternoon he and Ron escaped Hermione's baleful presence again and under the 
pretense of scouring the bare hedges for nonexistent blackberries, they continued their ongoing 
exchange of news. Harry had finally managed to tell Ron the whole story of his and Hermione's 
various wanderings, right up to the full story of what had happened at Godric's Hollow; Ron was 
now filling Harry in on everything he had discovered about the wider Wizarding world during his 
weeks away. 

"... and how did you find out about the Taboo?" he asked Harry after explaining the many 
desperate attempts of Muggle-borns to evade the Ministry." 

"The what?" 

��281ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"You and Hermione have stopped saying You-Know-Who's name!" 

"Oh, yeah, well, it's just a bad habit we've slipped into," said Harry. "But I haven't got a problem 
calling him V -" 

"NO!" roared Ron, causing Harry to jump into the hedge and Hermione (nose buried in a book 
at the tent entrance) to scowl over at them. "Sorry," said Ron, wrenching Harry back out of the 
brambles, "but the name's been jinxed, Harry, that's how they track people! Using his name breaks 
protective enchantments, it causes some kind of magical disturbance -it's how they found us in 
Tottenham Court Road!" 

"Because we used his name?" 

"Exactly! You've got to give them credit, it makes sense. It was only people who were serious 
about standing up to him, like Dumbledore, who even dared use it. Now they've put a Taboo on it, 
anyone who says it is trackable -quick-and-easy way to find Order members! They nearly got 
Kingsley -" 

"You're kidding?" 

"Yeah, a bunch of Death Eaters cornered him, Bill said, but he fought his way out. He's on the 
run now just like us." Ron scratched his chin thoughtfully with the end of his wand. "You don't 
reckon Kingsley could have sent that doe?" 

"His Patronus is a lynx, we saw it at the wedding, remember?" 

"Oh yeah...�� They moved farther along the hedge, away from the tent and Hermione. "Harry... 
you don't reckon it could've been Dumbledore?" 

"Dumbledore what?" 

Ron looked a little embarrassed, but said in a low voice, "Dumbledore ... the doe? I mean," Ron 

was watching Harry out of the corners of his eyes, "he had the real sword last, didn't he? 

Harry did not laugh at Ron, because he understood too well the longing behind the question. 

The idea that Dumbledore had managed to come back to them, that he was watching over them, 

would have inexpressibly comforting. He shook his head. "Dumbledore��s dead," he said. "I saw it 

happen, I saw the body. He's definitely gone. Anyway his Patronus was a phoenix, not a doe" 

"Patronuses can change, though can't they?" said Ron, "Tonks��s changed didn't it?" 

"Yeah, but if Dumbledore was alive, why wouldn't he show himself? Why wouldn't he just hand 

us the sword?

��282ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Search me," said Ron. "Same reason he didn't give it to you while he was alive? Same reason 

he left you an old Snitch and Hermione a book of kid's stories." 

"Which is what?" asked Harry, turning to look Ron full in the face desperate for the answer. 

"I dunno," said Ron. "Sometimes I've thought, when I've been a bit hack off (upset), he was 
having a laugh or -or he just wanted to make it more difficult. But I don't think so, not anymore. 
He knew what he was doing when he gave me the Deluminator, didn't he? He -well," Ron's ears 
turned bright red and he became engrossed in a tuft of grass at his feet, which he prodded with his 
toe, "he must've known I'd run out on you." 

"No," Harry corrected him. "He must've known you'd always want to come back." 

Ron looked grateful, but still awkward. 

Partly to change the subject, Harry said, "Speaking of Dumbledore, have you heard what 
Skeeter wrote about him?" 

"Oh yeah," said Ron at once, "people are talking about it quite a lot. 'Course, if things were 
different it'd be huge news, Dumbledore being pals with Grindelwald, but now it's just something 
to laugh about for people who didn't like Dumbledore, and a bit of a slap in the face for everyone 
who thought he was such a good bloke. I don't know that it's such a big deal, though. He was really 
young when they -" 

"Our age," said Harry, just as he had retorted to Hermione, and something in his face seemed to 
decide Ron against pursuing the subject. 

A large spider sat in the middle of a frosted web in the brambles. Harry took aim at it with the 
wand Ron had given him the previous night, which Hermione had since condescended to examine, 
and had decided was made of blackthorn. "Engorgio." The spider gave a little shiver, bouncing 
slightly in the web. Harry tried again. This time the spider grew slightly larger. 

"Stop that," said Ron sharply, "I'm sorry I said Dumbledore was young, okay?" 

Harry had forgotten Ron's hatred of spiders. "Sorry -Reducio." The spider did not shrink. Harry 
looked down at the blackthorn wand. Every minor spell he had cast with it so far that day had 
seemed less powerful than those he had produced with his phoenix wand. The new one felt 
intrusively unfamiliar, like having somebody else's hand sewn to the end of his arm. 

"You just need to practice," said Hermione, who had approached them noiselessly from behind 
and had stood watching anxiously as Harry tried to enlarge and reduce the spider. "It��s all a matter

of confidence Harry." 

He knew why she wanted it to be all right. She still felt guilty about breaking his wand. He bit 
back the retort that sprung to his lips, that she could take the blackthorn wand if she thought it 
made no difference, and he would have hers instead. 

Keen for them all to be friends again, however, he agreed; but when Ron gave Hermione a 
tentative smile, she stalked off and vanished behind her book once more. All three of them 
returned to the tent when darkness fell, and Harry took first watch. Sitting in the entrance, he tried 
to make the blackthorn wand levitate small stones at his feet; but his magic still seemed clumsier 
and less powerful than it had done before. Hermione was lying on her bunk reading, while Ron, 
after many nervous glances up at her, had taken a small wooden wireless out of his rucksack and 
started to try to tune it. 

"There's this one program," he told Harry in a low voice, "that tells the news like it really is. All 
the others are on You-Know-Who's side and are following the Ministry line, but this one ... you 
wait till you hear it, it's great. Only they can't do it every night, they have to keep changing 
locations in case they're raided and you need a password to tune in ... Trouble is, I missed the last 
one...�� 

He drummed lightly on the top of the radio with his wand muttering random words under his 
breath. He threw Hermione many covert glances, plainly fearing an angry outburst, but for all the 
notice she took of him he might not have been there. 

For ten minutes or so Ron tapped and muttered, Hermione turned the pages of her book, and 
Harry continued to practice with the blackthorn wand. Finally Hermione climbed down from her 
bunk. Ron ceased his tapping at once. "If it's annoying you, I'll stop!" he told Hermione nervously. 

Hermione did not deign (condescend) to respond, but approached Harry. 

"We need to talk," she said. 

He looked at the book still clutched in her hand. It was The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore. 

"What?" he said apprehensively. It flew through his mind that there was a chapter on him in 
there; he was not sure he felt up to hearing Rita's version of his relationship with Dumbledore. 

Hermione's answer however, was completely unexpected. "I want to go and see Xenophilius 
Lovegood." 

He stared at her. "Sorry?"

��284ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Xenophilius Lovegood, Luna��s father. I want to go and talk to him!�� 

��Er �C why?�� 

She took a deep breath, as though bracing herself, and said, ��It��s that mark, the mark in Beedle 
the Bard. Look at this!�� 

She thrust The Life and Lies of Albus Dumbledore under Harry��s unwilling eyes and saw a 
photograph of the original letter that Dumbledore had written Grindelwald, with Dumbledore��s 
familiar thin, slanting handwriting. He hated seeing absolute proof that Dumbledore really had 
written those words, that they had not been Rita��s invention. 

��The signature,�� said Hermione. ��Look at the signature, Harry!�� 

He obeyed. For a moment he had no idea what she was talking about, but, looking more closely 
with the aid of his lit wand, he saw that Dumbledore had replaced the A of Albus with a tiny 
version of the same triangular mark inscribed upon The Tales of Beedle the Bard. 

��Er �C what are you -?�� said Ron tentatively, but Hermione quelled him with a look and turned 
back to Harry. 

��It keeps cropping up, doesn��t it?�� she said. ��I know Viktor said it was Grindelwald��s mark, but 
it was definitely on that old grave in Godric��s Hollow, and the dates on the headstone were long 
before Grindelwald came along! And now this! Well, we can��t ask Dumbledore or Grindelwald 
what it means �C I don��t even know whether Grindelwald��s still alive �C but we can ask Mr. 
Lovegood. He was wearing the symbol at the wedding. I��m sure this is important, Harry!�� 

Harry did not answer immediately. He looked into her intense, eager face and then out into the 
surrounding darkness, thinking. After a long pause he said, ��Hermione, we don��t need another 
Godric��s Hollow. We talked ourselves into going there, and �C�� 

��But it keeps appearing, Harry! Dumbledore left me The Tales of Beedle the Bard, how do you 
know we��re not supposed to find out about the sign?�� 

��Here we go again!�� Harry felt slightly exasperated. ��We keep trying to convince ourselves 
Dumbledore left us secret signs and clues �C�� 

��The Deluminator turned out to be pretty useful,�� piped up Ron. ��I think Hermione��s right, I 
think we ought to go and see Lovegood.�� 

Harry threw him a dark look. He was quite sure that Ron��s support of Hermione had little to do 
with a desire to know the meaning of the triangular rune. 

��285ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It won��t be like Godric��s Hollow,�� Ron added, ��Lovegood��s on your side, Harry, The 

Quibbler��s been for you all along, it keeps telling everyone they��ve got to help you!��

 ��I��m sure this is important!�� said Hermione earnestly.

 ��But don��t you think if it was, Dumbledore would have told me about it before he died?�� 

��Maybe ... maybe it��s something you need to find out for yourself,�� said Hermione with a faint 

air of clutching at straws. 

 ��Yeah,�� said Ron sycophantically, ��that makes sense.�� 

��No, it doesn��t,�� snapped Hermione, ��but I still think we ought to talk to Mr. Lovegood. A 

symbol that links Dumbledore, Grindelwald, and Godric��s Hollow. Harry, I��m sure we ought to 

know about this!��

 ��I think we should vote on it,�� said Ron. ��Those in favor of going to see Lovegood �C�� 

His hand flew into the air before Hermione��s. Her lips quivered suspiciously as she raised her 
own. 

��Outvoted, Harry, sorry,�� said Ron, clapping him on the back. 

��Fine,�� said Harry, half amused, half irritated�ֿ����ֺ�Ц 
. ��Only, once we��ve seen 
Lovegood, let��s try and look for some more Horcruxes, shall we? Where do the Lovegood��s live, 
anyway? Do either of you know? 

��Yeah, they��re not far from my place,�� said Ron. ��I dunno exactly where, but Mum and Dad 
always point toward the hills whenever they mention them. Shouldn��t be hard to find.��

 When Hermione had returned to her bunk, Harry lowered his voice. 

 ��You only agreed to try and get back in her good books.�� 

��All's fair in love and war,�� said Ron brightly, ��and this is a bit of both. Cheer up, it��s the 

Christmas holidays, Luna��ll be home!�� 

They had an excellent view of the village of Ottery St. Catchopole from the breezy hillside to 
which they Disapparated next morning. From their high vantage point the village looked like a 
collection of toy houses in the great slanting shafts of sunlight stretching to earth in the breaks 
between clouds. They stood for a minute or two looking toward the Burrow, their hands shadowing 
their eyes, but all they could make out were the high hedges and trees of the orchard, which 
afforded the crooked little house protection from Muggle eyes.

��286ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��It��s weird, being this near, but not going to visit,�� said Ron. 

��Well, it��s not like you haven��t just seen them. You were there for Christmas,�� said Hermione 
coldly. 

��I wasn��t at the Burrow!�� said Ron with an incredulous laugh. ��Do you think I was going to go 
back there and tell them all I��d walked out on you? Yeah, Fred and George would��ve been great 
about it. And Ginny, she��d have been really understanding.��

 ��But where have you been, then?�� asked Hermione, surprised. 

��Bill and Fleur��s new place. Shell cottage. Bill��s always been decent to me. He �C he wasn��t 
impressed when he heard what I��d done, but he didn��t go on about it. He knew I was really sorry. 
None of the rest of the family know I was there. Bill told Mum he and Fleur weren��t going home 
for Christmas because they wanted to spend it alone. You know, first holiday after they were 
married. I don��t think Fleur minded. You know how much she hates Celestina Warbeck.��

 Ron turned his back on the Burrow. 

 ��Let��s try up here,�� he said, leading the way over the top of the hill. 

They walked for a few hours, Harry, at Hermione��s insistence, hidden beneath the Invisibility 
Cloak. The cluster of low hills appeared to be uninhabited apart from one small cottage, which 
seemed deserted. 

��Do you think it��s theirs, and they��ve gone away for Christmas?�� said Hermione, peering 
through the window at a neat little kitchen with geraniums on the windowsill. 

Ron snorted. ��Listen, I��ve got a feeling you��d be able to tell who lived there if you looked 
through the Lovegoods�� window. Let��s try the next lot of hills.��

 So they Disapparated a few miles farther north. 

��Aha!�� shouted Ron, as the wind whipped their hair and clothes. Ron was pointing upward, 
toward the top of the hill on which they had appeared, where a most strange-looking house rose 
vertically against the sky, a great black cylinder with a ghostly moon hanging behind it in the 
afternoon sky. ��That��s got to be Luna��s house, who else would live in a place like that? It looks 
like a giant rook����ѻ����ѻ; (Chess) castle - ��!��

 ��It��s nothing like a bird,�� said Hermione, frowning at the tower. 

 ��I was talking about a chess rook,�� said Ron. ��A castle to you.�� 

Ron��s legs were the longest and he reached the top of the hill first. When Harry and Hermione

��287ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

caught up with him, panting and clutching stitches in their sides, they found him grinning broadly.

 ��It��s theirs,�� said Ron. ��Look.��

 Three hand-painted signs had been tacked to a broke-down gate. 

The first read: THE QUIBBLER. EDITOR, X. LOVEGOOD 

the second: PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE 

the third: KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS 

The gate creaked as they opened it. The zigzagging path leading to the front door was 
overgrown with a variety of odd plants, including a bush covered in orange radishlike fruit Luna 
sometimes wore as earrings. Harry thought he recognized a Snargaluff and gave the wizened 
stump a wide berth. Two aged crab apple trees, bent with the wind, stripped of leaves but still 
heavy with berry-sized red fruits, and bushy crowns of white beaded mistletoe stood sentinel on 
either side of the front door. A little owl with a slightly flattened hawk-like head peered down at 
them from one of the branches. 

��You��d better take off the Invisibility Cloak, Harry,�� said Hermione. ��It��s you Mr. Lovegood 
wants to help, not us.�� 

He did as she suggested, handing her the Cloak to stow in the beaded bag. She then rapped 
three times on the thick black door, which was studded with iron nails and bore a knocker shaped 
like an eagle. 

Barely ten seconds passed, then the door was flung open and there stood Xenophilius Lovegood, 
barefoot and wearing what appeared to be a stained nightshirt. His long white candyfloss hair was 
dirty and unkempt. Xenophilius had been positively dapper at Bill and Fleur's wedding by 
comparison. 

"What? What is it? Who are you? What do you want?" he cried in a high-pitched, querulous 
voice, looking first at Hermione, then at Ron, and finally at Harry, upon which his mouth fell open 
in a perfect, comical O. 

"Hello, Mr. Lovegood," said Harry, holding out his hand, "I'm Harry, Harry Potter." 

Xenophilius did not take Harry's hand, although the eye that was not pointing inward at his nose

��288ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

slid straight to the scar on Harry's forehead. 

"Would it be okay if we came in?" asked Harry. "There's something we'd like to ask you." 

"I ... I'm not sure that's advisable," whispered Xenophilius. He swallowed and cast a quick look 

around the garden. "Rather a shock... My word... I ...I'm afraid I don't really think I ought to -" 

"It won't take long" said Harry, slightly disappointed by this less-than-warm welcome. 

"I - oh, all right then. Come in, quickly. Quickly!" 

They were barely over the threshold when Xenophilius slammed the door shut behind them. 
They were standing in the most peculiar kitchen Harry had ever seen. The room was perfectly 
circular, so that he felt like being inside a giant pepper pot. Everything was curved to fit the walls the 
stove, the sink, and the cupboards -and all of it had been painted with flowers, insects, and 
birds in bright primary colors. Harry thought he recognized Luna's styles. The effect, in such an 
enclosed space, was slightly overwhelming. 

In the middle of the floor, a wrought-iron spiral staircase led to the upper levels. There was a 
great deal of clattering and banging coming from overhead, Harry wondered what Luna could be 
doing. 

"You'd better come up." said Xenophilius, still looking extremely uncomfortable, and he led the 
way. 

The room above seemed to be a combination of living room and workplace, and, as such, was 
even more cluttered than the kitchen. Though much smaller and entirely round, the room 
somewhat resembled the Room of Requirement on the unforgettable occasion that it had 
transformed itself into a gigantic labyrinth comprised of centuries of hidden objects. There were 
piles upon piles of books and papers on every surface. Delicately made models of creatures Harry 
did not recognize, all flapping wings or snapping jaws, hung from the ceiling. 

Luna was not there. The thing that was making such a racket was a wooden object covered in 
magically turning cogs and wheels. It looked like the bizarre offspring of a workbench and a set of 
shelves, but after a moment Harry deduced that it was an old-fashioned printing press, due to the 
fact that it was churning out Quibblers. 

"Excuse me," said Xenophilius, and he strode over to the machine, seized grubbily tablecloth 
from beneath an immense number of books and papers, which all tumbled onto the floor, and 
threw it over the press, somewhat muffling the loud bangs and clatters. He then faced Harry.

"Why have you come here?" Before Harry could speak, however, Hermione let out a small cry 

of shock. 

"Mr. Lovegood - what's that?" 

She was pointing at an enormous, gray spiral horn, not unlike that of a unicorn, which had been 

mounted on the wall, protruding several feet into the room. 

"It is the horn of a Crumple-Horned Snorkack," said Xenophilius. 

"No it isn't!" said Hermione. 

"Hermione," muttered Harry, embarrassed, "now's not the moment -" 

"But Harry, it's an Erumpent horn! It's a Class B Tradeable Material and it's an extraordinary 
dangerous thing to have in a house!" 

"How'd you know it's an Erumpent horn?" asked Ron, edging away from the horn as fast as he 
could, given the extreme clutter of the room. 

"There's a description in Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them! Mr. Lovegood, you need to 
get rid of it straightaway, don't you know it can explode at the slightest touch?" 

"The Crumple Horned Snorkack," said Xenophilius very clearly, a mulish look upon his face, 
��is a shy and highly magical creature, and it's horn -" 

"Mr. Lovegood. I recognize the grooved markings around the base, that's an Erumpent horn and 
it's incredibly dangerous - I don't know where you got it -" 

"I bought it," said Xenophilius dogmatically. "Two weeks ago, from a delightful young wizard 
who knew my interest in the exquisite Snorkack. A Christmas surprise for my Luna. Now," he 
said, turning to Harry, "why exactly have you come here, Mr. Potter?" 

"We need some help," said Harry, before Hermione could start again. 

"Ah," said Xenophilius, "Help, Hmm." 

His good eye moved again to Harry's scar. He seemed simultaneously terrified and mesmerized. 

"Yes. The thing is ... helping Harry Potter ... rather dangerous...�� 

"Aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help Harry?" said Ron. "In 
that magazine of yours?" 

Xenophilius glanced behind him at the concealed printing press, still banging and clattering 
beneath the tablecloth. 

"Er - yes, I have expressed that view. However -" 

��290ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"That's for everyone else to do, not you personally?" said Ron. 

Xenophilius did not answer. He kept swallowing, his eyes darting between the three of them. 
Harry had the impression that he was undergoing some painful internal struggle. 

"Where's Luna?" asked Hermione. "Let's see what she thinks." 

Xenophilius gulped. He seemed to be steelingʹ��ǿ 
,ʹ�¾��� 
himself. Finally he said in a 
shaky voice difficult to hear over the noise of the printing press, "Luna is down at the stream, 
fishing for Freshwater Plimpies. She... she will like to see you. I'll go and call her and then -yes, 
very well. I shall try to help you." 

He disappeared down the spiral staircase and they heard the front open and close. They looked 

at each other. 

"Cowardly old wart," said Ron. "Luna's got ten times his guts." 

"He's probably worried about what'll happen to them if the Death Eaters find out I was here" 
said Harry. 

"Well, I agree with Ron," said Hermione, "Awful old hypocrite, telling everyone else to help 
you and trying to worm out of it himself. And for heaven's sake keep away from that horn." 

Harry crossed to the window on the far side of the room. He could see a stream, a thin, glittering 
ribbon lying far below them at the base of the hill. They were very high up; a bird fluttered past the 
window as he stared in the direction of the Burrow, now invisible beyond another line of hills. 
Ginny was over there somewhere. They were closer to each other today than they had been since 
Bill and Fleur's wedding, but she could have no idea he was gazing toward her now, thinking of 
her. He suppose he ought to be glad of it; anyone he came into contact with was in danger, 
Xenophilius's attitude proved that. 

He turned away from the windows and his gaze fell upon another peculiar object standing upon 
the cluttered, curved slide board; a stone bust of a beautiful but austere-looking witch wearing a 
most bizarre-looking headdress. Two objects that resembled golden ear trumpets����״������ 
curved out from the sides. A tiny pair of glittering blue wings was stuck to a leather strap that ran 
over the top of her head, while one of the orange radishes had been stuck to a second strap around 
her forehead. 

"Look at this," said Harry. 

"Fetching," said Ron. "Surprised he didn't wear that to the wedding." 

��291ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

They heard the front door close, and a moment later Xenophilius climbed back up the spiral 
staircase into the room, his thin legs now encase in Wellington boots, bearing a tray of ill-assorted 
teacups and a steaming teapot. 

"Ah, you have spotted my pet invention," he said, shoving the tray into Hermione's arms and 
joining Harry at the statue's side. "Modeled, fittingly enough, upon the head of the beautiful 
Rowens Ravenclaw, 'Wit beyond measure is a man's greatest treasure!'" 

He indicated the objects like ear trumpets. "These are the Wrackpurt siphons -to remove all 
sources of distraction from the thinker's immediate area. Here," he pointed out the tiny wings, "a 
billywig propeller, to induce an elevated frame of mind�ľ� 
/��. Finally," he pointed to the orange 
radish, "the dirigible Plum, so as to enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary." 

Xenophilius strode back to the tea tray, which Hermione had managed to balance precariously 
on one of the cluttered side tables. 

"May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots?" said Xenophilius. "We make it ourselves." As 
he started to pour out the drink, which was as deeply purple as beetroot juice, he added, "Luna is 
down beyond Bottom Bridge, she is most excited that you are here. She ought not to be too long, 
she has caught nearly enough Plumpies to make soup for all of us. Do sit down and help 
yourselves to sugar. 

"Now," he remove a tottering pile of papers from an armchair and sat down, his Wellingtoned 
legs crossed, "how may I help you, Mr. Potter?" 

"Well," said Harry, glancing at Hermione, who nodded encouragingly, "it's about that symbol 
you were wearing around your neck at Bill and Fleur's wedding, Mr. Lovegood. We wondered 
what it meant." 

Xenophilius raised his eyebrows. "Are you referring to the sign of the Deathly Hallows?"

Chapter Twenty-One 
The Tale of the Three Brothers 


Harry turned to look at Ron and Hermione. 


Neither of 
them seemed to have understood what 
Xenophilius had said either. 

"The Deathly Hallows?" 

"That's right," said Xenophilius. "You haven't 

heard of 
them? I'm not surprised. Very, very few wizards 

believe. 

Witness that knuckle-headed young man at your brother's wedding," he nodded at Ron, "who 
attacked me for sporting the symbol of a well-known Dark wizard! Such ignorance. There is 
nothing Dark about the Hallows �C at least not in that crude sense. One simply uses the symbol to 
reveal oneself to other believers, in the hope that they might help one with the Quest." 

He stirred several lumps of sugar into his Gurdyroot infusion and drank some. 

"I'm sorry," said Harry, "I still don't really understand." 

To be polite, he took a sip from his cup too, and almost gagged. The stuff was quite disgusting, 
as though someone had liquidized booger-flavored Every Flavor Beans. 

"Well, you see, believers seek the Deathly Hallows," said Xenophilius, smacking his lips in 

apparent appreciation of the Gurdyroot infusion. 

"But what are the Deathly Hallows?" asked Hermione. 

Xenophilius set aside his empty teacup. 

"I assume that you are familiar with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers'?" 

Harry said, "No," but Ron and Hermione both said, "Yes." Xenophilius nodded gravely. 

"Well, well, Mr. Potter, the whole thing starts with 'The Tale of the Three Brothers' ... I have a 
copy somewhere ...�� 

He glanced vaguely around the room, at the piles of parchment and books, but Hermione said, 
"I've got a copy, Mr. Lovegood, I've got it right here." 

And she pulled out The Tales of Beedle the Bard from the small, beaded bag. 

"The original?" inquired Xenophilius sharply, and when she nodded, he said, "Well then, why 

don't you read it out aloud? Much the best way to make sure we all understand."

��293ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Er... all right," said Hermione nervously. She opened the book, and Harry saw that the symbol 

they were investigating headed the top of the page as she gave a little cough, and began to read. 

"'There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight �C'" 

"Midnight, our mum always told us," said Ron, who had stretched out, arms behind his head, to 

listen. Hermione shot him a look of annoyance. 

"Sorry, I just think it's a bit spookier if it's midnight!" said Ron. 

"Yeah, because we really need a bit more fear in our lives," said Harry before he could stop 
himself. Xenophilius did not seem to be paying much attention, but was staring out of the window 
at the sky. "Go on, Hermione." 

"In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim 
across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their 
wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when 
they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. 

"'And Death spoke to them �C'" 

"Sorry," interjected Harry, "but Death spoke to them?" 

"It's a fairy tale, Harry!" 

"Right, sorry. Go on." 

"'And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of the three new victims, 
for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate 
the three brothers upon their magic, and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever 
enough to evade him. 

"'So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in 
existence, a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had 
conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree�ӹ�ľ on the banks of the river, fashioned a 
wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother. 

"'Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate 
Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a 
stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have 
the power to bring back the dead. 

"'And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like. The youngest

��294ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he 
asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by 
Death. And Death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.'" 

"Death's got an Invisibility Cloak?" Harry interrupted again. 

"So he can sneak up on people," said Ron. "Sometimes he gets bored of running at them, 
flapping his arms and shrieking ... sorry, Hermione." 

"'Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did 
so talking with wonder of the adventure they had had and admiring Death's gifts. 

"'In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. 

"'The first brother traveled on for a week more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a 
fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally, with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he 
could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor the oldest 
brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from 
Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. 

"'That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden upon his 

bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure (in addition to), slit the oldest brother's throat. 

"'And so Death took the first brother for his own. 

"'Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took 
out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his 
amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely 
death, appeared at once before him. 

"'Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the 
mortal world, she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad 
with hopeless longing, killed himself so as to truly join her. 

"'And so Death took the second brother for his own. 

"'But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find 
him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the 
Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And the he greeted Death as an old friend, and went 
with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.'" 

Hermione closed the book. It was a moment or two before Xenophilius seemed to realize that

��295ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

she had stopped reading; then he withdrew his gaze from the window and said, "Well, there you 

are." 

"Sorry?" said Hermione, sounding confused. 

"Those are the Deathly Hallows," said Xenophilius. 

He picked up a quill from a packed table at his elbow, and pulled a torn piece of parchment from 

between more books. 

"The Elder Wand," he said, and drew a straight vertical line upon the parchment. "The 
Resurrection Stone," he said, and added a circle on top of the line. "The Cloak of Invisibility," he 
finished, enclosing both line and circle in a triangle, to make the symbols that so intrigued 
Hermione. "Together," he said, "the Deathly Hallows." 

"But there's no mention of the words 'Deathly Hallows' in the story," said Hermione. 

"Well, of course not," said Xenophilius, maddeningly smug. "That is a children's tale, told to 
amuse rather than to instruct. Those of us who understand these matters, however, recognize that 
the ancient story refers to three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor 
master of Death." 

There was a short silence in which Xenophilius glanced out of the window. Already the sun was 

low in the sky. 

"Luna ought to have enough Plimpies soon," he said quietly. 

"When you say 'master of Death'..."said Ron. 

"Master," said Xenophilius, waving an airy hand. "Conqueror. Vanquisher. Whichever term you 

prefer." 

"But then ... do you mean ...�� said Hermione slowly, and Harry could tell that she was trying to 
keep any trace of skepticism out of her voice, "that you believe these objects �C these Hallows �C 
really exist?" 

Xenophilius raised his eyebrows again. "Well, of course." 

"But," said Hermione, and Harry could hear her restraint starting to crack, "Mr. Lovegood, how 
can you possibly believe �C?" 

"Luna has told me all about you, young lady," said Xenophilius. "You are, I gather, not 
unintelligent, but painfully limited. Narrow. Close-minded." 

"Perhaps you ought to try on the hat, Hermione," said Ron, nodding toward the ludicrous

��296ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

headdress. His voice shook with the strain of not laughing. 

"Mr. Lovegood," Hermione began again, "We all know that there are such things as Invisibility 
Cloaks. They are rare, but they exist. But �C" 

"Ah, but the Third Hallow is a true Cloak of Invisibility, Miss Granger! I mean to say, it is not a 
traveling cloak imbued with a Disillusionment Charm, or carrying a Bedazzling Hex, or else 
woven from Demiguise hair, which will hide one initially but fade with the years until it turns 
opaque. We are talking about a cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, 
and endures eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are 
cast at it. How many cloaks have you ever seen like that, Miss Granger?" 

Hermione opened her mouth to answer, then closed it again, looking more confused than ever. 
She, Harry and Ron glanced at one another, and Harry knew that they were all thinking the same 
thing. It so happened that a cloak exactly like the one Xenophilius had just described was in the 
room with them at that very moment. 

"Exactly," said Xenophilius, as if he had defeated them all in reasoned argument. "None of you 

have ever seen such a thing. The possessor would be immeasurably rich, would he not?" 

He glanced out of the window again. The sky was now tinged with the faintest trace of pink. 

"All right," said Hermione, disconcerted. "Say the Cloak existed... what about that stone, Mr. 

Lovegood? The thing you call the Resurrection Stone?" 

"What of it?" 

"Well, how can that be real?" 

"Prove that is not," said Xenophilius. 

Hermione looked outraged. 

"But that's �C I'm sorry, but that's completely ridiculous! How can I possibly prove it doesn't 
exist? Do you expect me to get hold of �C of all the pebbles in the world and test them? I mean, you 
could claim that anything's real if the only basis for believing in it is that nobody's proved it doesn't 
exist!" 

"Yes, you could," said Xenophilius. "I am glad to see that you are opening your mind a little." 

"So the Elder Wand," said Harry quickly, before Hermione could retort, "you think that exists 
too?" 

"Oh, well, in that case there is endless evidence," said Xenophilius. "The Elder Wand is the

��297ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hallow that is most easily traced, because of the way in which it passes from hand to hand." 

"Which is what?" asked Harry. 

"Which is that the possessor of the wand must capture it from its previous owner, if he is to be 
truly master of it," said Xenophilius. "Surely you have heard of the way the wand came to Egbert 
the Egregious, after his slaughter of Emeric the Evil? Of how Godelot died in his own cellar after 
his son, Hereward, took the wand from him? Of the dreadful Loxias, who took the wand from 
Baraabas Deverill, whom he had killed? The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the 
pages of Wizarding history." 

Harry glanced at Hermione. She was frowning at Xenophilius, but she did not contradict him. 

"So where do you think the Elder Wand is now?" asked Ron. 

"Alas, who knows?" said Xenophilius, as he gazed out of the window. "Who knows where the 
Elder Wand lies hidden? The trail goes cold with Arcus and Livius. Who can say which of them 
really defeated Loxias, and which took the wand? And who can say who may have defeated them? 
History, alas, does not tell us." 

There was a pause. 

Finally Hermione asked stiffly, "Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do 
with the Deathly Hallows?" 

Xenophilius looked taken aback as something shifted in Harry's memory, but he could not locate 
it. Peverell... he had heard that name before... 

"But you have been misleading me, young woman!" said Xenophilius, now sitting up much 
straighter in his chair and goggling at Hermione. "I thought you were new to the Hallows Quest! 
Many of us Questers believe that the Peverells have everything �C everything! �C to do with the 
Hallows!" 

"Who are the Peverells?" asked Ron. 

"That was the name on the grave with the mark on it, in Godric's Hollow," said Hermione, still 
watching Xenophilius. "Ignotus Peverell." 

"Exactly!" said Xenophilius, his forefinger raised pedanticallyѧ��ʽ�� ;��Ūѧ�ʵ�. "The 
sign of the Death Hallows on Ignotus's grave is conclusive proof!" 

"Of what?" asked Ron. 

"Why, that the three brothers in the story were actually the three Peverell brothers, Antioch,

��298ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cadmus and Ignotus! That they were the original owners of the Hallows!" 

With another glance at the window he got to his feet, picked up the tray, and headed for the 
spiral staircase. 

"You will stay for dinner?" he called, as he vanished downstairs again. "Everybody always 
requests our recipe for Freshwater Plimply soup." 

"Probably to show the Poisoning Department at St. Mungo's," said Ron under his breath. 

Harry waited until they could hear Xenophilius moving about in the kitchen downstairs before 

speaking. 

"What do you think?" he asked Hermione. 

"Oh, Harry," she said wearily, "it's a pile of utter rubbish. This can't be what the sign really 

means. This must just be his weird take on it. What a waste of time." 

"I s'pose this is the man who brought us Crumple-Horned Snorkacks," said Ron. 

"You didn't believe it either?" Harry asked him. 

"Nah, that story's just one of those things you tell kids to teach them lessons, isn't it? 'Don't go 
looking for trouble, don't go pick fights, don't go messing around with stuff that's best left alone! 
Just keep your head down, mind your own business, and you'll be okay'. Come to think of it," Ron 
added, "maybe that's story's reason why elder wands are supposed to be unlucky." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"One of those superstitions, isn't it? 'May-born witches will marry Muggles.' 'Jinx by twilight, 
undone by midnight.' 'Wand of cider, never prosper.' You must have heard them. My mum's full of 
them." 

"Harry and I were raised by Muggles," Hermione reminded him. "We were taught different 
superstitions." She sighed deeply as a rather pungent smell drifted up from the kitchen. The one 
good thing about her exasperation with Xenophilius was that it seemed to have made her forget 
that she was annoyed at Ron. "I think you're right," she told him. "It's just a morality tale, it's 
obvious which gift is best, which one you'd choose �C" 

The three of them spoke at the same time, Hermione said, "the Cloak," Ron said, "the wand," 

and Harry said, "the stone." 

They looked at each other, half surprised, half amused. 

"You're supposed to say the Cloak," Ron told Hermione, "but you wouldn't need to be invisible

��299ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

if you had the wand. An unbeatable wand, Hermione, come on!" 

 "We've already got an Invisibility Cloak," said Harry. 

"And it's helped us rather a lot, in case you hadn't noticed!" said Hermione. "Whereas the wand 

would be bound to attract trouble -" 

"Only if you shouted about it," argued Ron. "Only if you were prat enough to go dancing around 
waving it over your head, and singing, 'I've got an unbeatable want, come and have a go if you 
think you're hard enough.' As long as you kept your trap (Slang) mouth shut -" 

"Yes, but could you keep your trap shut?" said Hermione, looking skeptical. "You know the 
only true thing he said to us was that there have been stories about extra-powerful wands for 
hundreds of years." 

"There have?" asked Harry. 

Hermione looked exasperated. The expression was so endearingly familiar that Harry and Ron 
grinned at each other. "The Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, they crop up under different names 
through the centuries, usually in the possession of some Dark wizard who��s boasting about them. 
Professor Binns mentioned some of them, but -oh it's all nonsense. Wands are only as powerful as 
the wizards who use them. Some wizards just like to boast that theirs are bigger and better than 
other people's." 

"But how do you know," said Harry, "that those wands -the Deathstick, and the Wand of 

Destiny - aren't the same wand, surfacing over the centuries under different names?" 

"What, and they're all really the Elder Wand, made by Death?" said Ron. 

Harry laughed. The strange idea that had occurred to him was, after all, ridiculous. His wand, he 
reminded himself, had been of holly, not elder, and it had been made by Ollivander, whatever it 
had done that night Voldemort had pursued him across the skies and if it had been unbeatable, how 
could it have been broken? 

"So why would you take the stone?" Ron asked him. 

"Well, if you could bring people back, we could have Sirius... Mad-Eye... Dumbledore... my 
parents...�� 

Neither Ron nor Hermione smiled. 

"But according to Beedle the Bard, they wouldn't want to come back, would they?" said Harry, 

thinking about the tale they had just heard. "I don't suppose there have been loads of other stories

��300ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

about a stone that can raise the dead, have there?" he asked Hermione. 

"No," she replied sadly. "I don't think anyone except Mr. Lovegood could kid themselves that's 
possible. Beedle probably took the idea from the Sorcerer's Stone; you know, instead of a stone to 
make you immortal, a stone to reverse death." 

The smell from the kitchen was getting stronger. It was something like burning underpants. 
Harry wondered whether it would be possible to eat enough of whatever Xenophilius was cooking 
to spare���˺�his feelings. 

"What about the Cloak, though?" said Ron slowly. "Don't you realize, he's right? I've got so 
used to Harry's Cloak and how good it is, I never stopped to think. I've never heard of one like 
Harry's. It's infallible. We've never been spotted under it -" 

"Of course not - we're invisible when we're under it, Ron!" 

"But all the stuff he said about other cloaks, and they're not exactly ten a Knut, you know, is 
true! It's never occurred to me before but I've heard stuff about charms wearing off cloaks when 
they get old, or them being ripped apart by spells so they've got holes. Harry's was owned by his 
dad, so it's not exactly new, is it, but it's just ... perfect!" 

"Yes, all right, but Ron, the stone...�� 

As they argued in whispers, Harry moved around the room, only half listening. Reaching the 
spiral stair, he raised his eyes absently to the next level and was distracted at once. His own face 
was looking back at him from the ceiling of the room above. After a moment's bewilderment, he 
realized that it was not a mirror, but a painting. Curious, he began to clime the stairs. 

"Harry, what are you doing? I don't think you should look around when he's not here!" 

But Harry had already reached the next level. Luna had decorated her bedroom ceiling with five 
beautifully painted faces, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and Neville. They were not moving as the 
portraits at Hogwarts moved, but there was a certain magic about them all the same. Harry thought 
they breathed. What appeared to be fine golden chains wove around the pictures, linking them 
together, but after examining them for a minute or so, Harry realized that the chains were actually 
one work repeated a thousand times in golden ink, friends... friends... friends... Harry felt a great 
rush of affection for Luna. He looked around the room. There was a large photograph beside the 
bed, of a young Luna and a woman who looked very like her. They were hugging. Luna looked 
rather better-groomed in this picture than Harry had ever seen her in life. The picture was dusty.

This struck Harry as slightly odd. He stared around. Something was wrong. The pale blue carpet 
was also thick with dust. There were no clothes in the wardrobe, whose doors stood ajar. The bed 
had a cold, unfriendly look, as though it had not been slept in for weeks. A single cobweb stretched 
over the nearest window across the blood red sky. 

"What's wrong?" Hermione asked as Harry descended the staircase, but before he could respond, 

Xenophilius reached the top of the stairs from the kitchen, now holding a tray laden with bowls. 

"Mr. Lovegood," said Harry. "Where's Luna?" 

"Excuse me?" 

"Where's Luna?" 

Xenophilius halted on the top step. "I -I've already told you. She is down at the Botions Bridge 

fishing for Plimpies." 

"So why have you only laid that tray for four?" 

Xenophilius tried to speak, but no sound came out. The only noise was the continued chugging
���������� of the printing press, and a slight rattle from the tray as Xenophilius's hands shook. 

"I don't think Luna's been here for weeks." said Harry. "Her clothes are gone, her bed hasn't 
been slept in. Where is she? and why do you keep looking out of the window?" 

Xenophilius dropped the tray. The bowls bounced and smashed. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
drew their wands. Xenophilius froze, his hand about to enter his pocket. At that moment the 
printing press gave a huge bang and numerous Quibblers came streaming across the floor from 
underneath the tablecloth, the press fell silent at last. 

Hermione stooped down and picked up one of the magazines, her wand still pointing at Mr. 

Lovegood. 

"Harry, look at this." 

He strode over to her as quickly as he could through all the clutter. The front of the Quibbler 
carried his own picture, emblazoned with the words "Undesirable Number One" and captioned 
with the reward money. 

"The Quibbler's going for a new angle, then?" Harry asked coldly, his mind working very fast. 
"Is that what you were doing when you went into the garden, Mr. Lovegood? Sending an owl to 
the Ministry?�� 

Xenophilius licked his lips.

��302ҳ��

"They took my Luna," he whispered, "Because of what I've been writing. They took my Luna 
and I don't know where she is, what they've done to her. But they might give her back to me if I If 
I -" 

"Hand over Harry?" Hermione finished for him. 

"No deal." said Ron flatly. "Get out of the way, we're leaving." 

Xenophilius looked ghastly, a century old, his lips drawn back into a dreadful leer. 

"They will be here any moment. I must save Luna. I cannot lose Luna. You must not leave." He 
spread his arms in front of the staircase, and Harry had a sudden vision of his mother doing the 

same thing in front of his crib. 

"Don't make us hurt you," Harry said. "Get out of the way, Mr. Lovegood." 

"HARRY!" Hermione screamed. 

Figures on broomsticks were flying past the windows. As the three of them looked away from 
him. Xenophilius drew his wand. Harry realized their mistake just in time. He launched himself 
sideways, shoving Ron and Hermione out of harm's way as Xenophilius's Stunning Spell soared 
across the room and hit the Erumpent horn. There was a colossal explosion. The sound of it 
seemed to blow the room apart. Fragments of wood and paper and rubble flew in all directions, 
along with an impenetrable cloud of thick white dust. Harry flew through the air, then crashed to 
the floor, unable to see as debris rained upon him, his arms over his head. He heard Hermione's 
scream, Ron's yell, and a series of sickening metallic thuds which told him that Xenophilius had 
been blasted off his feet and fallen backward down the spiral stairs. Half buried in rubble, Harry 
tried to raise himself. He could barely breathe or see for dust. Half of the ceiling had fall in and the 
end of Luna's bed was hanging through the hole. The bust of Rowena Ravenclaw lay beside him 
with half its face missing, fragments of torn parchment were floating through the air, and most of 
the printing press lay on its side, blocking the top of the staircase to the kitchen. Then another 
white shape moved close by, and Hermione, coated in dust like a second statue, pressed her finger 
to her lips. 

The door downstairs crashed open. "Didn't I tell you there was no need to hurry, Travers?" said 

a rough voice. "Didn't I tell you this nutter was just raving as usual?" 

There was a bang and a scream of pain from Xenophilius. "No... no... upstairs... Potter!" 

"I told you last week Lovegood, we weren't coming back for anything less than some solid

information! Remember last week? When you wanted to swap your daughter for that stupid 
bleeding headdress? And the week before" -Another bang, another squeal -"When you thought 
we'd give her back if you offered us proof there are "Cumple" -bang -"Headed" �C bang "
Snorkacks?" 

"No - no - I beg of you!" sobbed Xenophilius. "It really is Potter, Really!" 

"And now it turns out you only called us here to try and blow us up!" roared the Death Eater, 
and there was a volley of bangs interspersed with squeals of agony from Xenophilius. 

"The place looks like it's about to fall in, Selwyn," said a cool second voice, echoing up the 
mangled staircase. "The stairs are completely blocked. Could try clearing it? Might bring the place 
down." 

"You lying piece of filth." shouted the wizard named Selwyn. "You have never seen Potter in 
your life, have you? Thought you'd lure us here to kill us, did you? And you think you'll get your 
girl back like this?" 

"I swear... I swear... Potter's upstairs!" 

"Homenum revelio." said the voice at the foot of the stairs. Harry heard Hermione gasp, and he 
had the odd sensation something was swooping low over him, immersing his body in its shadow. 

"There's someone up there all right, Selwyn," said the second man sharply. 

"It's Potter, I tell you, it's Potter!" sobbed Xenophilius. "Please... please... give me Luna, just let 

me have Luna...�� 

"You can have your little girl, Lovegood," said Selwyn, "if you get up those stairs and bring me 
down Harry Potter. But if this is a plot, if it's a trick, if you've got an accomplice waiting up there 
to ambush us, we'll see if we can spare a bit of your daughter for you to bury." 

Xenophilius gave a wail of fear and despair. There were scurryings and scrapings. Xenophilius 
was trying to get through the debris on the stairs. 

"Come on," Harry whispered, "we've got to get out of here." He started to dig himself out under 
cover of all the noise Xenophilius was making on the staircase. Ron was buried the deepest. Harry 
and Hermione climbed, as quietly as they could, over all the wreckage to where he lay, trying to 
prise a heavy chest of drawers off his legs. While Xenophilius��s banging and scraping drew nearer 
and nearer, Hermione managed to free Ron with the use of a Hover Charm. 

"All right." breathed Hermione, as the broken printing press blocking the top of the stairs begin

��304ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to tremble. Xenophilius was feet away from them. She was still white with dust. "Do you trust me, 

Harry?" 

Harry nodded. 

"Okay then." Hermione whispered. "give me the invisibility Cloak. Ron, you're going to put it 

on." 

"Me? But Harry -" 

"Please, Ron! Harry, hold on tight to my hand, Ron grab my shoulder." 

Harry held out his left hand. Ron vanished beneath the Cloak. The printing press blocking the 

stairs was vibrating. Xenophilius was trying to shift it using a Hover Charm. Harry did not know 

what Hermione was waiting for. 

"Hold tight" she whispered. "Hold tight... any second...�� 

Xenophilius's paper-white face appeared over the top of the sideboard. "Obliviate!" cried 
Hermione, pointing her want first into his face then at the floor beneath them. "Deprimo!" She had 
blasted a hole in the sitting room floor. They fell like boulders. Harry still holding onto her hand 
for dear life, there was a scream from below, and he glimpsed two men trying to get out of the way 
as vast quantities of rubble and broken furniture rained all around them from the shattered ceiling. 
Hermione twisted in midair and thundering of the collapsing house rang in Harry's ears as she 
dragged him once more into darkness.

Chapter Twenty-Two 
The Deathly Hallows 



Harry fell, panting, onto grass and 

scrambled up 
at once. They seemed to have landed in the 

corner of a 
field at dusk; Hermione was already 

running in a 
circle around them, waving her wand. 
��Protego Totalum... Salvio Hexia...�� 
��That treacherous old bleeder.�� Ron 

panted, 
emerging from beneath the Invisibility 

Cloak and 
throwing it to Harry. ��Hermione you��re a genius, a total 
genius. I can��t believe we got out of that.�� 

��Cave Inimicum... Didn��t I say it was an Erumpent horn, didn��t I tell him? And now his house 
has been blown apart!�� 

��Serves him right,�� said Ron, examining his torn jeans and the cuts to his legs, ��What��d you 
reckon they��ll do to him?�� 

��Oh I hope they don��t kill him!�� groaned Hermione, ��That��s why I wanted the Death Eaters to 
get a glimpse of Harry before we left, so they knew Xenophilius hadn��t been lying!��

 ��Why hide me though?�� asked Ron. 

��You��re supposed to be in bed with spattergrolt, Ron! They��ve kidnapped Luna because her 

father supported Harry! What would happen to your family if they knew you��re with him?��

 ��But what about your mum and dad?��

 ��They��re in Australia,�� said Hermione, ��They should be all right. They don��t know anything.�� 

��You��re a genius,�� Ron repeated, looking awed. 

��Yeah, you are, Hermione,�� agreed Harry fervently. ��I don��t know what we��d do without you.�� 

She beamed, but became solemn at once. ��What about Luna?�� 

��Well, if they��re telling the truth and she��s still alive -�� began Ron. 

��Don��t say that, don��t say it!�� squealed Hermione. ��She must be alive, she must!�� 

��Then she��ll be in Azkaban, I expect,�� said Ron. ��Whether she survives the place, though... 
Loads don��t...��

��306ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��She will,�� said Harry. He could not bear to contemplate the alternative. ��She��s tough, Luna, 
much tougher than you��d think. She��s probably teaching all the inmates about Wrackspurts and 
Nargles.�� 

��I hope you��re right,�� said Hermione. She passed a hand over her eyes. ��I��d feel so sorry for 

Xenophilius if -�� 

��-if he hadn��t just tried to sell us to the Death Eaters, yeah,�� said Ron. 

They put up the tent and retreated inside it, where Ron made them tea. After their narrow 

escape, the chilly, musty old place felt like home, safe, familiar, and friendly. 

��Oh, why did we go there?�� groaned Hermione after a few minutes�� silence. ��Harry, you were 
right, it was Godric��s Hollow all over again, a complete waste of time! The Deathly Hallows... 
such rubbish... although actually,�� a sudden thought seemed to have struck her, ��he might have 
made it all up, mightn��t he? He probably doesn��t believe in the Deathly Hallows at all, he just 
wanted to keep us talking until the Death Eaters arrived!�� 

��I don��t think so,�� said Ron. ��It��s a damn sight harder making stuff up when you��re under stress 
than you��d think. I found that out when the Snatchers caught me. It was much easier pretending to 
be Stan, because I knew a bit about him, than inventing a whole new person. Old Lovegood was 
under loads of pressure, trying to make sure we stayed put. I reckon he told us the truth, or what he 
thinks is the truth, just to keep us talking.�� 

��Well, I don��t suppose it matters,�� sighed Hermione. ��Even if he was being honest, I never 

heard such a lot of nonsense in all my life.�� 

��Hang on, though,�� said Ron. ��The Chamber of Secrets was supposed to be a myth, wasn��t it?�� 

��But the Deathly Hallows can��t exist, Ron!�� 

��You keep saying that, but one of them can,�� said Ron. ��Harry��s Invisibility Cloak -�� 

��The Tale of the Three Brothers is a story,�� said Hermione firmly. ��A story about how humans 
are frightened of death. If surviving was as simple as hiding under the Invisibility Cloak, we��d 
have everything we need already!�� 

��I don��t know. We could do with an unbeatable wand,�� said Harry, turning the blackthorn wand 
he so disliked over in his fingers. 

��There��s no such thing, Harry!�� 

��You said there have been loads of wands - the Deathstick and whatever they were called -��

��307ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��All right, even if you want to kid yourself the Elder Wand��s real, what about the Resurrection 
Stone?�� Her fingers sketched quotation marks around the name, and her tone dripped sarcasm. ��No 
magic can raise the dead, and that��s that!�� 

��When my wand connected with You-Know-Who��s, it made my mum and dad appear... and 
Cedric...�� 

��But they weren��t really back from the dead, were they?�� said Hermione. ��Those kind of -of 
pale imitations aren��t the same as truly bringing someone back to life.�� 

��But she, the girl in the tale, didn��t really come back, did she? The story says that once people 
are dead, they belong with the dead. But the second brother still got to see her and talk to her, 
didn��t he? He even lived with her for a while...�� 

He saw concern and something less easily definable in Hermione��s expression. Then, as she 
glanced at Ron, Harry realized that it was fear. He had scared her with his talk of living with dead 
people. 

��So that Peverell bloke who��s buried in Godric��s Hollow,�� he said hastily, trying to sound 
robustly sane, ��you don��t know anything about him, then?�� 

��No,�� she replied, looking relieved at the change of subject. ��I looked him up after I saw the 
mark on his grave; if he��d been anyone famous or done anything important, I��m sure he��d be in 
one of our books. The only place I��ve managed to find the name 'Peverell' is Nature��s Nobility, A 
Wizarding Genealogy. I borrowed it from Kreacher,�� she explained as Ron raised his eyebrows. ��It 
lists the pure-blood families that are now extinct in the male line. Apparently the Peverells were 
one of the earliest families to vanish.�� 

��Extinct in the male line?�� repeated Ron. 

��It means the name died out,�� said Hermione, ��centuries ago, in the case of the Peverells. They 
could still have descendents, though, they��d just be called something different.�� 

And then it came to Harry in one shining piece, the memory that had stirred at the sound of the 
name ��Peverell��, a filthy old man brandishing an ugly ring in the face of a Ministry official, and he 
cried aloud, ��Marvolo Gaunt!�� 

��Sorry?�� said Ron and Hermione together. 

��Marvolo Gaunt! You-Know-Who��s grandfather! In the Pensieve! With Dumbledore! Marvolo 
Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!��

��308ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Ron and Hermione looked bewildered. 

��The ring, the ring that became the Horcrux, Marvolo Gaunt said it had the Peverell coat of arms 
on it! I saw him waving it in the bloke from the Ministry��s face, he nearly shoved it up his nose!�� 

��The Peverell coat of arms?�� said Hermione sharply. ��Could you see what it looked like?�� 

��Not really,�� said Harry, trying to remember. ��There was nothing fancy on there, as far as I 

could see; maybe a few scratches. I only ever saw it really close up after it had been cracked 

open.�� 

Harry saw Hermione��s comprehension in the sudden widening of her eyes. 

Ron was looking from one to the other, astonished. ��Blimey... You reckon it was this sign 

again? The sign of the Hallows? 

��Why not?�� said Harry excitedly, ��Marvolo Gaunt was an ignorant old git who lived like a pig, 
all he cared about was his ancestry. If that ring had been passed down through the centuries, he 
might not have known what it really was. There were no books in that house, and trust me, he 
wasn��t the type to read fairy tales to his kids. He��d have loved to think the scratches on the stone 
were a coat of arms, because as far as he was concerned, having pure blood made you practically 
royal.�� 

��Yes... and that��s all very interesting,�� said Hermione cautiously, ��but Harry, if you��re thinking 
what I think you��re think -�� 

��Well, why not? Why not?�� said Harry, abandoning caution. ��It was a stone, wasn��t it?�� He 
looked at Ron for support. ��What if it was the Resurrection Stone?�� 

Ron��s mouth fell open. 

��Blimey - but would it still work if Dumbledore broke -?�� 

��Work? Work? Ron, it never worked! There��s no such thing as a Resurrection Stone!�� 

Hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry. ��Harry you��re trying to fit everything 
into the Hallows story -�� 

��Fit everything in?�� he repeated. ��Hermione, it fits of its own accord! I know the sign of the 
Deathly Hallows was on that stone! Gaunt said he was descended from the Peverells!�� 

��A minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!�� 

��Where��d you reckon the ring is now?�� Ron asked Harry. ��What did Dumbledore do with it 

after he broke it open?��

��309ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

But Harry��s imagination was racing ahead, far beyond Ron and Hermione��s... 

Three objects, or Hallows, which, if united, will make the possessor master of Death... Master... 
Conqueror... Vanquisher... The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death... 

And he saw himself, possessor of the Hallows, facing Voldemort, whose Horcruxes were no 
match... Neither can live while the other survives... Was this the answer? Hallows versus 
Horcruxes? Was there a way after all, to ensure that he was the one who triumphed? If he were the 
master of the Deathly Hallows, would he be safe? 

��Harry?�� 

But he scarcely heard Hermione. He had pulled out his Invisibility Cloak and was running it 
through his fingers, the cloth supple as water, light as air. He had never seen anything to equal it in 
his nearly seven years in the Wizarding world. The Cloak was exactly what Xenophilius had 
described, A cloak that really and truly renders the wearer completely invisible, and endures 
eternally, giving constant and impenetrable concealment, no matter what spells are cast at it... 

And then, with a gasp, he remembered. ��Dumbledore had my Cloak the night my parents died!�� 

His voice shook and he could feel the color in his face, but he did not care. 

��My mum told Sirius that Dumbledore borrowed the Cloak! This is why! He wanted to examine 
it, because he thought it was the third Hallow! Ignotus Peverell is buried in Godric��s Hollow...�� 

Harry was walking blindly around the tent, feeling as though great new vistas of truth were 
opening all around him. ��He��s my ancestor. I��m descended from the third brother! It all makes 
sense!�� 

He felt armed in certainty, in his belief in the Hallows, as if the mere idea of possessing them 
was giving him protection, and he felt joyous as he turned back to the other two. 

��Harry,�� said Hermione again, but he was busy undoing the pouch around his neck, his fingers 
shaking hard. 

��Read it,�� he told her, pushing his mother��s letter into her hand. ��Read it! Dumbledore had the 
Cloak, Hermione! Why else would he want it? He didn��t need a Cloak, he could perform a 
Disillusionment Charm so powerful that he made himself completely invisible without one!�� 

Something fell to the floor and rolled, glittering, under a chair, He had dislodged the Snitch 
when he pulled out the letter. He stooped to pick it up, and then the newly tapped spring of 
fabulous discoveries threw him another gift, and shock and wonder erupted inside him so that he

��310ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

shouted out. 

��IT��S IN HERE! He left me the ring �C it��s in the Snitch!�� 

��You - you reckon?�� 

He could not understand why Ron looked taken aback. It was so obvious, so clear to Harry. 
Everything fit, everything... His Cloak was the third Hallow, and when he discovered how to open 
the Snitch he would have the second, and then all he needed to do was find the first Hallow, the 
Elder Wand, and then... 

But it was as though a curtain fell on a lit stage. All his excitement, all his hope and happiness 
were extinguished at a strokeһ���� , and he stood alone in the darkness, and the glorious spell 
was broken. 

��That��s what he��s after.�� 

The change in his voice made Ron and Hermione look even more scared. 

��You-Know-Who��s after the Elder Wand.�� 

He turned his back on their strained, incredulous faces. He knew it was the truth. It all made 
sense, Voldemort was not seeking a new wand; he was seeking an old wand, a very old wand 
indeed. Harry walked to the entrance of the tent, forgetting about Ron and Hermione as he looked 
out into the night, thinking... 

Voldemort had been raised in a Muggle orphanage. Nobody could have told him The Tales of 
Beedle the Bard when he was a child, any more than Harry had heard them. Hardly any wizards 
believed in the Deathly Hallows. Was it likely that Voldemort knew about them? 

Harry gazed into the darkness... If Voldemort had known about the Deathly Hallows, surely he 
would have sought them, done anything to possess them, three objects that made the possessor 
master of Death. If he had known about the Deathly Hallows, he might not have needed Horcruxes 
in the first place. Didn��t the simple fact that he had taken a Hallow, and turned it into a Horcrux, 
demonstrate that he did not know this last great Wizarding secret? 

Which meant that Voldemort sought the Elder Wand without realizing its full power, without 
understanding that it was one of three... for the wand was the Hallow that could not be hidden, 
whose existence was best known... The bloody trail of the Elder Wand is splattered across the 
pages of Wizarding history... 

Harry watched the cloudy sky, curves of smoke-gray and silver sliding over the face of the white

��311ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

moon. He felt lightheaded with amazement at his discoveries. 

He turned back into the tent. It was a shock to see Ron and Hermione standing exactly where he 
had left them, Hermione still holding Lily��s letter, Ron at her side looking slightly anxious. Didn��t 
they realize how far they had traveled in the last few minutes? 

��This is it?�� Harry said, trying to bring them inside the glow of his own astonished certainty, 
��This explains everything. The Deathly Hallows are real and I��ve got one - maybe two -�� 

He held up the Snitch. ��-and You-Know-Who��s chasing the third, but he doesn��t realize... he 
just thinks it��s a powerful wand -�� 

��Harry,�� said Hermione, moving across to him and handing him back Lily��s letter, ��I��m sorry, 
but I think you��ve got this wrong, all wrong.�� 

��But don��t you see? It all fits -�� 

��Not, it doesn��t,�� she said. ��It doesn��t. Harry, you��re just getting carried away. Please,�� she said 
as he started to speak, ��please just answer me this. If the Deathly Hallows really existed, and 
Dumbledore knew about them, knew that the person who possessed all of them would be master of 
Death - Harry, why wouldn��t he have told you? Why?�� 

He had his answer ready. ��But you said it, Hermione! You��ve got to find out about them for 
yourself! It��s a Quest!�� 

��But I only said that to try and persuade you to come to the Lovegoods'!�� cried Hermione in 
exasperation. ��I didn��t really believe it!�� 

Harry took no notice. ��Dumbledore usually let me find out stuff for myself. He let me try my 
strength, take risks. This feels like the kind of thing he��d do.�� 

��Harry, this isn��t a game, this isn��t practice! This is the real thing, and Dumbledore left you very 
clear instructions: Find and destroy the Horcruxes! That symbol doesn��t mean anything, forget the 
Deathly Hallows, we can��t afford to get sidetracked -�� 

Harry was barely listening to her. He was turning the Snitch over and over in his hands, half 
expecting it to break open, to reveal the Resurrection Stone, to prove to Hermione that he was 
right, that the Deathly Hallows were real. 

She appealed to Ron. ��You don��t believe in this, do you?�� 

Harry looked up, Ron hesitated.

��312ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I dunno... I mean... bits of it sort of fit together,�� said Ron awkwardly, ��But when you look at 
the whole thing...�� He took a deep breath. ��I think we��re supposed to get rid of Horcruxes, Harry. 
That��s what Dumbledore told us to do. Maybe... maybe we should forget about this Hallows 
business.�� 

��Thank you, Ron,�� said Hermione. ��I��ll take first watch.�� 

And she strode past Harry and sat down in the tent entrance bringing the action to a fierce full 
stop. 

But Harry hardly slept that night. The idea of the Deathly Hallows had taken possession of him, 
and he could not rest while agitating thoughts whirled through his mind, the wand, the stone, and 
the Cloak, if he could just possess them all... 

I open at the close... But what was the close? Why couldn��t he have the stone now? If only he 
had the stone, he could ask Dumbledore these questions in person... and Harry murmured words to 
the Snitch in the darkness, trying everything, even Parseltongue, but the golden ball would not 
open... 

And the wand, the Elder Wand, where was that hidden? Where was Voldemort searching now? 
Harry wished his scar would burn and show him Voldemort��s thoughts, because for the first time 
ever, he and Voldemort were united in wanting the very same thing... Hermione would not like 
that idea, of course... But then, she did not believe. Xenophilius had been right, in a way... Limited, 
Narrow, Close-minded. The truth was that she was scared of the idea of the Deathly Hallows, 
especially of the Resurrection Stone... and Harry pressed his mouth again to the Snitch, kissing it, 
nearly swallowing it, but the cold medal did not yield... 

It was nearly dawn when he remembered Luna, alone in a cell in Azkaban, surrounded by 
dementors, and he suddenly felt ashamed of himself. He had forgotten all about her in his feverish 
contemplation of the Hallows. If only they could rescue her, but dementors in those numbers 
would be virtually unassailable. Now he came to think about it, he had not tried casting a Patronus 
with the blackthorn wand... He must try that in the morning... 

If only there was a way of getting a better wand... 

And desire for the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, unbeatable, invincible, swallowed him once 
more... 

They packed up the tent next morning and moved on through a dreary shower of rain. The

��313ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

downpour pursued them to the coast, where they pitched the tent that night, and persisted through 
the whole week, through sodden landscapes that Harry found bleak and depressing. He could think 
only of the Deathly Hallows. It was as though a flame had been lit inside him that nothing, not 
Hermione��s flat disbelief nor Ron��s persistent doubts, could extinguish. And yet the fiercer the 
longing for the Hallows burned inside him, the less joyful it made him. He blamed Ron and 
Hermione. Their determined indifference was as bad as the relentless rain for dampening his 
spirits, but neither could erode his certainty, which remained absolute. Harry��s belief in and 
longing for the Hallows consumed him so much that he felt isolated from the other two and their 
obsession with the Horcruxes. 

��Obsession?�� said Hermione in a low fierce voice, when Harry was careless enough to use the 
word one evening, after Hermione had told him off for his lack of interest in locating more 
Horcruxes. ��We��re not the one with an obsession, Harry! We��re the ones trying to do what 
Dumbledore wanted us to do!�� 

But he was impervious to the veiled criticism. Dumbledore had left the sign of the Hallows for 
Hermione to decipher, and he had also, Harry remained convinced of it, left the Resurrection Stone 
hidden in the golden Snitch. Neither can live while the other survives... master of Death... Why 
didn��t Ron and Hermione understand? 

��The last enemy shall be destroyed is death,���� Harry quoted calmly. 

��I thought it was You-Know-Who we were supposed to be fighting?�� Hermione retorted, and 
Harry gave up on her. 

Even the mystery of the silver doe, which the other two insisted on discussing, seemed less 
important to Harry now, a vaguely interesting sideshow. The only other thing that mattered to him 
was that his scar had begun to prickle again, although he did all he could to hide this fact from the 
other two. He sought solitude whenever it happened, but was disappointed by what he saw. The 
visions he and Voldemort were sharing had changed in quality; they had become blurred, shifting 
as though they were moving in and out of focus. Harry was just able to make out the indistinct 
features of an object that looked like a skull, and something like a mountain that was more shadow 
than substance. Used to images sharp as reality, Harry was disconcerted by the change. He was 
worried that the connection between himself and Voldemort had been damaged, a connection that

��314ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

he both feared and, whatever he had told Hermione, prized. Somehow Harry connected these 
unsatisfying, vague images with the destruction of his wand, as if it was the blackthorn wand��s 
fault that he could no longer see into Voldemort��s mind as well as before. 

As the weeks crept on, Harry could not help but notice, even through his new self-absorption, 
that Ron seemed to be taking charge. Perhaps because he was determined to make up for having 
walked out on (desert, abandon) them, perhaps because Harry��s descent into listlessness 
galvanized his dormant leadership qualities, Ron was the one now encouraging and exhorting the 
other two into action. 

��Three Horcruxes left,�� he kept saying. ��We need a plan of action, come on! Where haven��t we 
looked? Let��s go through it again. The orphanage...�� 

Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Riddle House, Borgin and Burkes, Albania, every place that they 
knew Tom Riddle had ever lived or worked, visited or murdered. Ron and Hermione raked over 
them again, Harry joining in only to stop Hermione pestering him. He would have been happy to 
sit alone in silence, trying to read Voldemort��s thoughts, to find out more about the Elder Wand, 
but Ron insisted on journeying to ever more unlikely places simply, Harry was aware, to keep 
them moving. 

��You never know,�� was Ron��s constant refrain. ��Upper Flagley is a Wizarding village, he 
might��ve wanted to live there. Let��s go and have a poke around.�� 

These frequent forays into Wizarding territory brought them within occasional sight of 
Snatchers. 

��Some of them are supposed to be as bad as Death Eaters,�� said Ron. ��The lot that got me were 
a bit pathetic, but Bill reckons some of them are really dangerous. They said on Potterwatch �C�� 

��On what?�� said Harry. 

��Potterwatch, didn��t I tell you that��s what it was called? The program I keep trying to get on the 
radio, the only one that tells the truth about what��s going on! Nearly all of the programs are 
following You-Know-Who��s line, all except Potterwatch, I really want you to hear it, but it��s 
tricky tuning in...�� 

Ron spent evening after evening using his wand to beat out various rhythms on top of the 
wireless while the dials whirled. Occasionally they would catch snatches of advice on how to treat 
dragonpox, and once a few bars of ��A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love.�� While he taped, Ron

��315ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

continued to try to hit on the correct password, muttering strings of random words under his 
breath. 

��They��re normally something to do with the Order,�� he told them. ��Bill had a real knack for 
guessing them. I��m bound to get one in the end...�� 

But not until March did luck favor Ron at last. Harry was sitting in the tent entrance, on guard 
duty, staring idly at a clump of grape hyacinths that had forced their way through the chilly 
ground, when Ron shouted excitedly from inside the tent. 

��I��ve got it, I��ve got it! Password was 'Albus'! Get in here, Harry.�� 

Roused for the first time in days from his contemplation of the Deathly Hallows, Harry hurried 
back inside the tent to find Ron and Hermione kneeling on the floor beside the little radio. 
Hermione, who had been polishing the sword of Gryffindor just for something to do, was sitting 
open-mouthed, staring at the tiny speaker, from which a most familiar voice was issuing. 

��... apologize for our temporary absence from the airwaves, which was due to a number of house 

calls in our area by those charming Death Eaters.�� 

��But that��s Lee Jordan!�� said Hermione. 

��I know!�� beamed Ron. ��Cool, eh?�� 

��... now found ourselves another secure location,�� Lee was saying, and I��m pleased to tell you 

that two of our regular contributors have joined me here this evening. Evening, boys!�� 

��Hi.�� 

��Evening, River.�� 

����River���� that��s Lee,�� Ron explained. ��They��ve all got code names, but you can usually tell -�� 

��Shh!�� said Hermione. 

��But before we hear from Royal and Romulus,�� Lee went on, ��let��s take a moment to report 
those deaths that the Wizarding Wireless Network News and Daily Prophet don��t think important 
enough to mention. It is with great regret that we inform our listeners of the murders of Ted Tonks 
and Dirk Cresswell.�� 

Harry felt a sick, swooping in his belly. He, Ron, and Hermione gazed at one another in horror. 

��A goblin by the name of Gornuk was also killed. It is believed that Muggle-born Dean Thomas 
and a second goblin, both believed to have been traveling with Tonks, Cresswell, and Gornuk, may 
have escaped. If Dean is listening, or if anyone has any knowledge of his whereabouts, his parents

��316ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and sisters are desperate for news. 

��Meanwhile, in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle 
authorities are attributing their deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix 
inform me that it was the Killing Curse -more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that 
Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime. 

��Finally, we regret to inform our listeners that the remains of Bathilda Bagshot have been 
discovered in Godric��s Hollow. The evidence is that she died several months ago. The Order of the 
Phoenix informs us that her body showed unmistakable signs of injuries inflicted by Dark Magic. 

��Listeners, I��d like to invite you now to join us in a minute��s silence in memory of Ted Tonks, 
Dirk Cresswell, Bathilda Bagshot, Gornuk, and the unnamed, but no less regretted, Muggles 
murdered by the Death Eaters.�� 

Silence fell, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione did not speak. Half of Harry yearned to hear more, 
half of him was afraid of what might come next. It was the first time he had felt fully connected to 
the outside world for a long time. 

��Thank you,�� said Lee��s voice. ��And now we can return to regular contributor Royal, for an 

update on how the new Wizarding order is affecting the Muggle world.�� 

��Thanks, River,�� said an unmistakable voice, deep, measured���ȵ�, reassuring. 

��Kingsley!�� burst out Ron. 

��We know!�� said Hermione, hushing him. 

��Muggles remain ignorant of the source of their suffering as they continue to sustain heavy 
casualties,�� said Kingsley. ��However, we continue to hear truly inspirational stories of wizards and 
witches risking their own safety to protect Muggle friends and neighbors, often without the 
Muggles' knowledge. I��d like to appeal to all our listeners to emulateЧ�� 
their example, perhaps 
by casting a protective charm over any Muggle dwellings in your street. Many lives could be saved 
if such simple measures are taken.�� 

��And what would you say, Royal, to those listeners who reply that in these dangerous times, it 
should be ��Wizards first��?�� asked Lee. 

��I��d say that it��s one short step from ��Wizards first�� to ��Purebloods first,�� and then to ��Death 
Eaters,���� replied Kingsley. ��We��re all human, aren��t we? Every human life is worth the same, and 
worth saving.��

��317ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Excellently put, Royal, and you��ve got my vote for Minister of Magic if we ever get out of this 
mess,�� said Lee. ��And now, over to Romulus for our popular feature (in a newspaper) regular 
column) 'Pals of Potter'.�� 

��Thanks, River,�� said another very familiar voice. Ron started to speak, but Hermione 
forestalled him in a whisper. 

��We know it��s Lupin!�� 

��Romulus, do you maintain, as you have every time you��ve appeared on our program, that Harry 
Potter is still alive?�� 

��I do,�� said Lupin firmly. ��There is no doubt at all in my mind that his death would be 
proclaimed as widely as possible by the Death Eaters if it had happened, because it would strike a 
deadly blow at the morale of those resisting the new regime. 'The Boy Who Lived' remains a 
symbol of everything for which we are fighting, the triumph of good, the power of innocence, the 
need to keep resisting.�� 

A mixture of gratitude and shame welled up in Harry. Had Lupin forgiven him, then, for the 

terrible things he had said when they had last met? 

��And what would you say to Harry if you knew he was listening, Romulus?�� 

��I��d tell him we��re all with him in spirit,�� said Lupin, then hesitated slightly, ��And I��d tell him 

to follow his instincts, which are good and nearly always right.�� 

Harry looked at Hermione, whose eyes were full of tears. 

��Nearly always right,�� she repeated. 

��Oh, didn��t I tell you?�� said Ron in surprise. ��Bill told me Lupin��s living with Tonks again! And 
apparently she��s getting pretty big too...�� 

��... and our usual update on those friends of Harry Potter��s who are suffering for their 
allegiance?�� Lee was saying. 

��Well, as regular listeners will know, several of the more outspoken supporters of Harry Potter 
have now been imprisoned, including Xenophilius Lovegood, erstwhile editor of The Quibbler,�� 
said Lupin. 

 ��At least he��s still alive!�� muttered Ron. 

��We have also heard within the last few hours that Rubeus Hagrid�� �C all three of them gasped, 
and so nearly missed the rest of the sentence -��well-known gamekeeper at Hogwarts School, has

��318ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

narrowly escaped arrest within the grounds of Hogwarts, where he is rumored to have hosted a 
'Support Harry Potter' party in his house. However, Hagrid was not taken into custody, and is, we 
believe, on the run.�� 

��I suppose it helps, when escaping from Death Eaters, if you��ve got a sixteen-foot-high half 
brother?�� asked Lee. 

��It would tend to give you an edge,�� agreed Lupin gravely. ��May I just add that while we here 
at Potterwatch applaud Hagrid��s spirit, we would urge even the most devoted of Harry��s 
supporters against following Hagrid��s lead. 'Support Harry Potter' parties are unwise in the present 
climate.�� 

��Indeed they are, Romulus,�� said Lee, ��so we suggest that you continue to show your devotion 
to the man with the lightning scar by listening to Potterwatch! And now let��s move to news 
concerning the wizard who is proving just as elusive as Harry Potter. We like to refer to him as the 
Chief Death Eater, and here to give his views on some of the more insane rumors circulating about 
him, I��d like to introduce a new correspondent. Rodent?��

 ����Rodent��?�� said yet another familiar voice, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione cried out together,

 ��Fred!��

 ��No �C is it George?��

 ��It��s Fred, I think,�� said Ron, leaning in closer, as whichever twin it was said, 

 ��I��m not being ��Rodent��, no way, I told you I wanted to be ��Rapier���ɶ�ϸ���Ľ���!�� 

��Oh, all right then, Rapier, could you please give us your take on the various stories we��ve been 
hearing about the Chief Death Eater?�� 

��Yes, River, I can,�� said Fred. ��As our listeners will know, unless they��ve taken refuge at the 
bottom of a garden pond or somewhere similar, You-Know-Who��s strategy of remaining in the 
shadows is creating a nice little climate of panic. Mind you, if all the alleged sightings of him are 
genuine, we must have a good nineteen You-Know-Whos running around the place.�� 

��Which suits him, of course,�� said Kingsley. ��The air of mystery is creating more terror than 
actually showing himself.�� 

��Agreed,�� said Fred. ��So, people, let��s try and calm down a bit. Things are bad enough without 
inventing stuff as well. For instance, this new idea that You-Know-Who can kill people with a 
single glance from his eyes. That��s a basilisk, listeners. One simple test, check whether the thing

��319ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

that��s glaring at you has got legs. If it has, it��s safe to look into its eyes, although if it really is YouKnow-
Who, that��s still likely to be the last thing you ever do.�� 

For the first time in weeks and weeks, Harry was laughing. He could feel the weight of tension 
leaving him.

 ��And the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?�� asked Lee. 

��Well, who wouldn��t want a nice little holiday after all the hard work he��s been putting in?�� 
asked Fred. ��Point is, people, don��t get lulled into a false sense of security, thinking he��s out of the 
country. Maybe he is, maybe he isn��t, but the fact remains he can move faster than Severus Snape 
confronted with shampoo when he wants to, so don��t count on him being a long way away if 
you��re planning to take any risks. I never thought I��d hear myself say it, but safety first!�� 

��Thank you very much for those wise words, Rapier,�� said Lee. ��Listeners, that brings us to the 
end of another Potterwatch. We don��t know when it will be possible to broadcast again, but you 
can be sure we shall be back. Keep twiddling those dials. The next password will be ��Mad-Eye��. 
Keep each other safe, Keep faith. Good night.�� 

The radio��s dial twirled and the lights behind the tuning panel went out. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione were still beaming. Hearing familiar, friendly voices was an extraordinary tonic; Harry 
had become so used to their isolation he had nearly forgotten that other people were resisting 
Voldemort. It was like waking from a long sleep.

 ��Good, eh?�� said Ron happily.

 ��Brilliant,�� said Harry.

 ��It��s so brave of them,�� sighed Hermione admiringly. ��If they were found ...��

 ��Well, they keep on the move, don��t they?�� said Ron. ��Like us.�� 

��But did you hear what Fred said?�� asked Harry excitedly; now the broadcast was over, his 
thoughts turned around toward his all consuming obsession. ��He��s abroad! He��s still looking for 

the Wand, I knew it!��

 ��Harry����

 ��Come on, Hermione, why are you so determined not to admit it? Vol �C��

 ��HARRY, NO!��

 ����demort��s after the Elder Wand!�� 

��The name��s Taboo!�� Ron bellowed, leaping to his feet as a loud crack sounded outside the

tent. ��I told you, Harry, I told you, we can��t say it anymore �C we��ve got to put the protection back 
around us �C quickly �C it��s how they find �C�� 

But Ron stopped talking, and Harry knew why. The Sneakoscope on the table had lit up and 
begun to spin; they could hear voices coming nearer and nearer, rough, excited voices. Ron pulled 
the Deluminator out of his pocket and clicked it. Their lamps went out.

 ��Come out of there with your hands up!�� came a rasping voice through the darkness. ��We know 
you��re in there! You��ve got half a dozen wands pointing at you and we don��t care who we curse!��

Chapter Twenty-Three 
Malfoy Manor 


Harry looked around at the other two, now 
in the darkness. He saw Hermione point her 
toward the outside, but into his face; there was a 
of white light, and he buckled in agony, unable 
could feel his face swelling rapidly under his 
heavy footfalls surrounded him. 

"Get up, vermin." Unknown hands dragged 
roughly off the ground, before he could stop 


mere outlines

bang, a burst 
to see. He 
hands as

them, 

someone had rummaged through his pockets and removed the blackthorn wand. Harry clutched at 
his excruciatingly painful face, which felt unrecognizable beneath his fingers, tight, swollen, and 
puffy as though he had suffered some violent allergic reaction. His eyes had been reduced to slits 
through which he could barely see; his glasses fell off as he was bundled out of the tent, all he 
could make out were the blurred shapes of four or five people wrestling Ron and Hermione outside 
too. 

"Get - off - her!" Ron shouted. There was the unmistakable sound of knuckles hitting flesh, Ron 
grunted in pain and Hermione screamed, "No! Leave him alone, leave him alone!" 

"Your boyfriend's going to have worse than that done to him if he's on my list," said the 
horribly familiar, rasping voice. "Delicious girl... what a treat ... I do enjoy the softness of the 
skin." 

Harry's stomach turned over. He knew who this was, Fenrit Greyback, the werewolf who was 

permitted to wear Death Eater robes in return for his hired savagery.

 "Search the tent!" said another voice. 

Harry was thrown face down onto the ground. A thud told him that Ron had been cast down 
beside him. They could hear footsteps and crashes; the men were pushing over chairs inside the 
tent as they searched. 

"Now, let's see who we've got," said Greyback's gloating voice from overhead, and Harry was 
rolled over onto his back. A beam of wand light fell onto his face and Greyback laughed.

��322ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I'll be needing butterbeer to wash this one down. What happened to you, ugly?"

 Harry did not answer immediately. 

"I said," repeated Greyback, and Harry received a blow to the diaphragm that made him double 
over in pain. "what happened to you?"

 "Stung." Harry muttered. "Been Stung." 

 "Yeah, looks like it." said a second voice.

 "What��s your name?" snarled Greyback.

 "Dudley." said Harry.

 "And your first name?" 

 "I - Vernon. Vernon Dudley." 

"Check the list, Scabior." said Greyback, and Harry head him move sideways to look down at 

Ron, instead. "And what about you, ginger?" 

 "Stan Shunpike." said Ron. 

"Like 'ell you are." said the man called Scabior. "We know Stan Shunpike, 'e's put a bit of work 

our way."

 There was another thud.

 "I'b Bardy," said Ron, and Harry could tell that his mouth was full of blood. "Bardy Weasley." 

"A Weasley?" rasped Greyback. "So you're related to blood traitors even if you're not a 

Mudblood. And lastly, your pretty little friend ...�� The relish in his voice made Harry's flesh crawl.

 "Easy, Greyback." said Scabior over the jeering of the others.

 "Oh, I'm not going to bite just yet. We'll see if she��s a bit quicker at remembering her name than 

Barny. Who are you, girly?

 "Penelope Clearwater." said Hermione. She sounded terrified, but convincing.

 "What's your blood status?" 

 "Half-Blood." said Hermione. 

"Easy enough to check," said Scabior. "But the 'ole lot of 'em look like they could still be 

'ogwarts age -" 

 "We'b lebt," said Ron. 

"Left, 'ave you, ginger?" said Scabior. "And you decided to go camping? And you thought, just 

for a laugh, you'd use the Dark Lords name?" 

��323ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Nod a laugh," said Ron. "Aggiden." 

 "Accident?" There was more jeering laughter. 

"You know who used to like using the Dark Lord's name, Weasley?" growled Greyback, "The 
Order of the Phoenix. Mean anything to you?"

 "Doh." 

"Well, they don't show the Dark Lord proper respect, so the name's been Tabooed. A few Order 

members have been tracked that way. We'll see. Bind them up with the other two prisoners!" 

 Someone yanked Harry up by the hair, dragged him a short way, pushed him down into a sitting 
position, then started binding him back-to-back with other people. Harry was still half blind, barely 
able to see anything through his puffed-up eyes. When at last the man tying them had walked 
away, Harry whispered to the other prisoners. 

 "Anyone still got a wand?" 

 "No." said Ron and Hermione from either side of him.

 "This is all my fault. I said the name. I'm sorry -" 

 "Harry?" 

It was a new, but familiar voice. And it came from directly behind Harry, from the person tied 
to Hermione's left.

 "Dean?" 
"It is you! If they find out who they've got! They're Snatchers, they're only looking for truants��
����to sell for gold -" 

"Not a bad little haul for one night." Greyback was saying, as a pair of hobnailed boots (boot 
with nails placed in the sole for protection) marched close by Harry and they heard more crashes 
from inside the tent. "A Mudblood, a runaway goblin, and these truants. You checked their names 
on the list yet, Scabior?" he roared.

 "Yeah. There's no Vernon Dudley on 'ere, Greyback."

 "Interesting," said Greyback. "That's interesting." 

He crouched down beside Harry, who saw, through the infinitesimal gap left between his 
swollen eyelids, a face covered in matted gray hair and whiskers, with pointed brown teeth and 
sores in the corners of his mouth. Greyback smelled as he had done at the top of the tower where 
Dumbledore had died, of dirt, sweat, and blood. 

��324ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"So you aren't wanted, then, Vernon? Or are you on that list under a different name? What 

house were you in at Hogwarts?" 

 "Slytherin," said Harry automatically. 

"Funny 'ow they all thinks we wants to 'ear that." leered Scabior out of the shadows. "But none 
of 'em can tell us where the common room is." 

"It's in the dungeons." said Harry clearly. "You enter through the wall. It's full of skulls and 
stuff and it��s under the lake, so the light's all green,"

 There was a short pause. 

"Well, well, looks like we really 'ave caught a little Slytherin." said Scabior. "Good for you, 

Vernon, 'cause there ain't a lot of Mudblood Slytherins. Who's your father?" 

"He works at the Ministry," Harry lied. He knew that his whole story would collapse with the 
smallest investigation, but on the other hand, he only had until his face regained its usual 
appearance before the game was up in any case. "Department of Magical Accidents and 
Catastrophes."

 "You know what, Greyback," said Scabior. "I think there is a Dudley in there." 

 Harry could barely breathe. Could luck, sheer luck, get them safely out of this? 

"Well, well." said Greyback, and Harry could hear the tiniest note of trepidation in that callous 
voice, and knew that Greyback was wondering whether he had just indeed just attacked and bound 
the son of a Ministry Official. Harry's heart was pounding against the ropes around his ribs; he 
would not have been surprised to know that Greyback could see it. 

"If you're telling the truth, ugly, you've got nothing to fear from a trip to the Ministry. I expect 

your father'll reward us just for picking you up." 

 "But," said Harry, his mouth bone dry, "if you just let us -" 

 "Hey!" came a shout from inside the tent. "Look at this. Greyback!" 

A dark figure came bustling toward them, and Harry saw a glint of silver to the light of their 
wands. They had found Gryffindor's sword. 

"Ve-e-ery nice," said Greyback appreciatively, taking it from his companion. "Oh, very nice 
indeed. Looks goblin-made, that. Where did you get something like this?" 

"It's my father's," Harry lied, hoping against hope that it was too dark for Greyback to see the 
name etched just below the hilt. "We borrowed it to cut firewood -" 

��325ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"'ang on a minute, Greyback! Look at this, in the Prophet!" 

As Scabior said it, Harry's scar, which was stretched tight across his distended forehead, burned 
savagely. More clearly than he could make out anything around him, he saw a towering building, a 
grim fortress, jet-black and forbidding, Voldemort's thoughts had suddenly become Razor-Sharp 
again; he was gliding toward the gigantic building with a sense of calmly euphoric purpose ... 

So close ... So close ... 

With a huge effort of will Harry closed his mind to Voldemort's thoughts, pulling himself back 
to where he sat, tied to Ron, Hermione, Dean, and Griphook in the darkness, listening to Greyback 
and Scabior. 

"'Hermione Granger," Scabior was saying, "the Mudblood who is known to be traveling with 
'arry Potter." 

Harry's scar burned in the silence, but he made a supreme effort to keep himself present, nor to 
slip into Voldemort's mind. He heard the creak of Greyback's boots as he crouched down, in front 
of Hermione.

 "You know what, little girly? This picture looks a hell of a lot like you."

 "It isn't! It isn't me!"

 Hermione's terrified squeak was as good as a confession. 

"... known to be traveling with Harry Potter," repeated Greyback quietly.

 A stillness had settled over the scene. Harry's scar was exquisitely painful, but he struggled with 
all his strength against the pull of Voldemort's thoughts. It had never been so important to remain 
in his own right mind. 

"Well, this changed things, doesn't it?" whispered Greyback. Nobody spoke. Harry sensed the 
gang of Snatchers watching, frozen, and felt Hermione's arm trembling against his. Greyback got 
up and took a couple of steps to where Harry sat, crouching down again to stare closely at his 
misshapen features. 

"What's that on your forehead, Vernon?" he asked softly, his breath foul in Harry's nostrils as 
he pressed a filthy finger to the taught scar. 

"Don't touch it!�� Harry yelled; he could not stop himself, he thought he might be sick from the 
pain of it.

 "I thought you wore glasses, Potter?" breathed Greyback.

��326ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I found glasses!" yelped one of the Snatchers skulking in the background. "There was glasses 
in the tent, Greyback, wait -" 

And seconds later Harry's glasses had been rammed back onto his face. The Snatchers were 
closing in now, peering at him.

 "It is!" rasped Greyback. "We've caught Potter!" 

They all took several steps backward, stunned by what they had done. Harry, still fighting to 
remain present in his own splitting head, could think of nothing to say. Fragmented visions were 
breaking across the surface of his mind - 

-He was hiding around the high walls of the black fortress - 

 No, he was Harry, tied up and wandless, in grave danger - 

-looking up, up to the topmost window, the highest tower - 

 He was Harry, and they were discussing his fate in low voices - 

 -Time to fly ... 

 "... To the Ministry?" 

"To hell with the Ministry." growled Greyback. "They'll take the credit, and we won't get a look 
in. I say we take him straight to You-Know-Who." 

 "Will you summon 'im? 'ere?" said Scabior, sounding awed, terrified. 

"No," snarled Greyback, "I haven't got -they say he's using the Malfoy's place as a base. We'll 

take the boy there." 

Harry thought he knew why Greyback was not calling Voldemort. The werewolf might be 
allowed to wear Death Eater robes when they wanted to use him, but only Voldemort's inner circle 
were branded with the Dark Mark, Greyback had not been granted this highest honor.

sword as well. If they��re rubies, that��s another small fortune right there.�� 

The prisoners were dragged to their feet. Harry could hear Hermione��s breathing, fast and 
terrified. 

��Grab hold and make it tight. I��ll do Potter!�� said Greyback, seizing a fistful of Harry��s hair; 
Harry could feel his long yellow nails scratching his scalp. ��On three! One �C two �C three �C�� 

They Disapparated, pulling the prisoners with them. Harry struggled, trying to throw off 
Greyback��s hand, but it was hopeless, Ron and Hermione were squeezed tightly against him on 
either side; he could not separate from the group, and as the breath was squeezed out of him his 
scar seared more painfully still �C 

�C as he forced himself through the slit of a window like a snake and landed, lightly as vapor 
inside the cell-like room �C 
The prisoners lurched into one another as they landed in a country lane. Harry��s eyes, still 
puffy, took a moment to acclimatize, then he saw a pair of wrought-iron gates at the foot of what 
looked like a long drive. He experienced the tiniest trickle of relief. The worst had not happened 
yet, Voldemort was not here. He was, Harry knew, for he was fighting to resist the vision, in some 
strange, fortresslike place, at the top of a tower. How long it would take Voldemort to get to this 
place, once he knew that Harry was here, was another matter.

 One of the Snatchers strode to the gates and shook them.

 ��How do we get in? They��re locked, Greyback, I can��t �C blimey!�� 

He whipped his hands away in fright. The iron was contorting, twisting itself out of the abstract 
furls and coils into a frightening face, which spoke in a clanging, echoing voice. ��State your 

purpose!��

 ��We��ve got Potter!�� Greyback roared triumphantly. ��We��ve captured Harry Potter!��

 The gates swung open. 

��Come on!�� said Greyback to his men, and the prisoners were shunted through the gates and up 

the drive, between high hedges that muffled their footsteps. Harry saw a ghostly white shape above

him, and realized it was an albino peacock. He stumbled and was dragged onto his feet by 
Greyback; now he was staggering along sideways, tied back-to-back (one right after another, in 
immediate succession) to the four other prisoner. Closing his puffy eyes, he allowed the pain in his 
scar to overcome him for a moment, wanting to know what Voldemort was doing, whether he 
knew yet that Harry was caught.. 

The emaciated figure stirred beneath its thin blanket and rolled over toward him, eyes opening 
in a skull of a face. The frail man sat up, great sunken eyes fixed upon him, upon Voldemort, and 
then he smiled. Most of his teeth were gone. 

��So, you have come. I thought you would ... one day. But your journey was pointless. I never 
had it.��

 ��You lie!�� 

As Voldemort��s anger throbbed inside him, Harry��s scar threatened to burst with pain, and he 
wrenched his mind back to his own body, fighting to remain present as the prisoners were pushed 
over gravel. 

 Light spilled out over all of them.

 ��What is this?�� said a woman��s cold voice.

 ��We��re here to see He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!�� rasped Greyback.

 ��Who are you?�� 

��You know me!�� There was resentment in the werewolf��s voice. ��Fenrit Greyback! We��ve 
caught Harry Potter!�� 

Greyback seized Harry and dragged him around to face the light, forcing the other prisoners to 
shuffle around too. 

��I know 'e��s swollen, ma'am, but it��s 'im!�� piped up Scabior. ��If you look a bit closer, you��ll see 
'is scar. And this 'ere, see the girl? The Mudblood who��s been traveling around with 'im, ma'am. 
There��s no doubt it��s 'im, and we��ve got 'is wand as well! 'Ere, ma��am �C�� 

Through his puffy eyelids Harry saw Narcissa Malfoy scrutinizing his swollen face. Scabior 

thrust the blackthorn wand at her. She raised her eyebrows.

 ��Bring them in,�� she said. 

Harry and the others were shoved and kicked up broad stone steps into a hallway lined with 

portraits.

��329ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Follow me,�� said Narcissa, leading the way across the hall. ��My son, Draco, is home for his 
Easter holidays. If that is Harry Potter, he will know.�� 

The drawing room dazzled after the darkness outside; even with his eyes almost closed Harry 
could make out the wide proportions of the room. A crystal chandelier hung from the ceiling, more 
portraits against the dark purple walls. Two figures rose from chairs in front of an ornate marble 
fireplace as the prisoners were forced into the room by the Snatchers.

 ��What is this?�� 

The dreadfully familiar, drawling voice of Lucius Malfoy fell on Harry��s ears. He was 
panicking now. He could see no way out, and it was easier, as his fear mounted, to block out 
Voldemort��s thoughts, though his scar was still burning. 

��They say they��ve got Potter,�� said Narcissa��s cold voice. ��Draco, come here.�� Harry did not 
dare look directly at Draco, but saw him obliquely; a figure slightly taller than he was, rising from 
an armchair, his face a pale and pointed blur beneath white-blond hair.

 Greyback forced the prisoners to turn again so as to place Harry directly beneath the chandelier.

 ��Well, boy?�� rasped the werewolf. 

Harry was facing a mirror over the fireplace, a great gilded thing in an intricately scrolled����
����װ�� frame. Through the slits of his eyes he saw his own reflection for the first time since 
leaving Grimmauld Place. 

His face was huge, shiny, and pink, every feature distorted by Hermione��s jinx. His black hair 
reached his shoulders and there was a dark shadow around his jaw. Had he not known that it was 
he who stood there, he would have wondered who was wearing his glasses. He resolved not to 
speak, for his voice was sure to give him away; yet he still avoided eye contact with Draco as the 
latter approached. 

��Well, Draco?�� said Lucius Malfoy. He sounded avid. 

��Is it? Is it Harry Potter?�� 

��I can��t �C I can��t be sure,�� said Draco. He was keeping his distance from Greyback, and seemed 
as scared of looking at Harry as Harry was of looking at him.

 ��But look at him carefully, look! Come closer!��

 Harry had never heard Lucius Malfoy so excited.

 ��Draco, if we are the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark Lord, everything will be forgiv �C��

��330ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Now, we won��t be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope Mr. Malfoy?�� said Greyback 
menacingly. 

��Of course not, of course not!�� said Lucius impatiently. He approached Harry himself, came so 
close that Harry could see the usually languid, pale face in sharp detail even through his swollen 
eyes. With his face a puffy mask, Harry felt as though he was peering out from between the bars of 
a cage. 

 ��What did you do to him?�� Lucius asked Greyback. ��How did he get into this state?��

 ��That wasn��t us.�� 

��Looks more like a Stinging Jinx to me,�� said Lucius.

 His gray eyes raked Harry��s forehead. 

��There��s something there,�� he whispered. ��it could be the scar, stretched tight... Draco, come 
here, look properly! What do you think?�� 

Harry saw Draco��s face up close now, right beside his father��s. They were extraordinarily alike, 
except that while his father looked beside himself with excitement, Draco��s expression was full of 
reluctance, even fear. 

��I don��t know,�� he said, and he walked away toward the fireplace where his mother stood 
watching. 

��We had better be certain, Lucius,�� Narcissa called to her husband in her cold, clear voice. 
��Completely sure that it is Potter, before we summon the Dark Lord ... They say this is his...�� �C she 
was looking closely at the blackthorn wand �C ��but it does not resemble Ollivander��s description... 
If we are mistaken, if we call the Dark Lord here for nothing ... Remember what he did to Rowle 
and Dolohov?�� 

��What about the Mudblood, then?�� growled Greyback. Harry was nearly thrown off his feet as 
the Snatchers forced the prisoners to swivel around again, so that the light fell on Hermione 
instead. 

��Wait,�� said Narcissa sharply. ��Yes �C yes, she was in Madam Malkin��s with Potter! I saw her 

picture in the Prophet! Look, Draco, isn��t it the Granger girl?��

 ��I ... maybe ... yeah.�� 

��But then, that��s the Weasley boy!�� shouted Lucius, striding around the bound prisoners to face 

Ron. ��It��s them, Potter��s friends �C Draco, look at him, isn��t it Arthur Weasley��s son, what��s his

��331ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

name �C?��

 ��Yeah,�� said Draco again, his back to the prisoners. ��It could be.�� 

The drawing room door opened behind Harry. A woman spoke, and the sound of the voice 

wound Harry��s fear to an even higher pitch.

 ��What is this? What��s happened, Cissy?�� 

Bellatrix Lestrange walked slowly around the prisoners, and stopped on Harry��s right, staring at 

Hermione through her heavily lidded eyes,

 ��But surely,�� she said quietly, ��this is the Mudblood girl? This is Granger?�� 

��Yes, yes, it��s Granger!�� cried Lucius, ��And beside her, we think, Potter! Potter and his friends, 

caught at last!�� 

��Potter?�� shrieked Bellatrix, and she backed away, the better to take in Harry. ��Are you sure? 
Well then, the Dark Lord must be informed at once!�� She dragged back her left sleeve, Harry saw 
the Dark Mark burned into the flesh of her arm, and knew that she was about to touch it, to 
summon her beloved master. 

��I was about to call him!�� said Lucius, and his hand actually closed upon Bellatrix��s wrist, 
preventing her from touching the Mark. ��I shall summon him, Bella. Potter has been brought to my 
house, and it is therefore upon my authority �C�� 

��Your authority!�� she sneered, attempting to wrench her hand from his grasp. ��You lost your 

authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!��

 ��This is nothing to do with you, you did not capture the boy �C�� 

��Begging your pardon, Mr. Malfoy,�� interjected Greyback, ��but it��s us that caught Potter, and 

it��s us that��ll be claiming the gold �C�� 

��Gold!�� laughed Bellatrix, still attempting to throw off her brother-in-law, her free hand 
groping in her pocket for her wand. ��Take your gold, filthy scavenger, what do I want with gold? I 
seek only the honor of his �C of �C�� 

She stopped struggling, her dark eyes fixed upon something Harry could not see. Jubilant at her 

capitulation, Lucius threw her hand from him and ripped up his own sleeve �C 

 ��STOP!�� shrieked Bellatrix, ��Do not touch it, we shall all perish if the Dark Lord comes now!�� 

Lucius froze, his index finger hovering over his own Mark. Bellatrix strode out of Harry��s 

limited line of vision. 

��332ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��What is that?�� he heard her say.

 ��Sword,�� grunted an out-of-sight Snatcher.

 ��Give it to me.��

 ��It��s not yours, missus, it��s mine, I reckon I found it.�� 

There was a bang and a flash of red light; Harry knew that the Snatcher had been Stunned. 
There was a roar of anger from his fellows, Scabior drew his wand. 

 ��What d��you think you��re playing at, woman?��

 ��Stupefy!�� she screamed, ��Stupefy!�� 

They were no match for her, even thought there were four of them against one of her, she was a 
witch, as Harry knew, with prodigious skill and no conscience. They fell where they stood, all 
except Greyback, who had been forced into a kneeling position, his arms outstretched. Out of the 
corners of his eyes Harry saw Bellatrix bearing down upon the werewolf, the sword of Gryffindor 
gripped tightly in her hand, her face waxen. 

��Where did you get this sword?�� she whispered to Greyback as she pulled his wand out of his 
unresisting grip. 

��How dare you?�� he snarled, his mouth the only thing that could move as he was forced to gaze 
up at her. He bared his pointed teeth. ��Release me, woman!�� 

��Where did you find this sword?�� she repeated, brandishing it in his face, ��Snape sent it to my 
vault in Gringotts!��

 ��It was in their tent,�� rasped Greyback. ��Release me, I say!�� 

She waved her wand, and the werewolf sprang to his feet, but appeared too wary to approach 
her. He prowled behind an armchair, his filthy curved nails clutching its back. 

��Draco, move this scum outside,�� said Bellatrix, indicating the unconscious men. ��If you 
haven��t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me.��

 ��Don��t you dare speak to Draco like �C�� said Narcissa furiously, but Bellatrix screamed. 

��Be quiet! The situation is graver than you can possibly imagine, Cissy! We have a very serious 
problem!�� 

She stood, panting slightly, looking down at the sword, examining its hilt. Then she turned to 
look at the silent prisoners. 

��If it is indeed Potter, he must not be harmed,�� she muttered, more to herself than to the others.

��333ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��The Dark Lord wishes to dispose of Potter himself... But if he finds out ... I must ... I must 
know... ��

 She turned back to her sister again. 

��The prisoners must be placed in the cellar, while I think what to do!�� 

��This is my house, Bella, you don��t give orders in my �C�� 

��Do it! You have no idea of the danger we��re in!�� shrieked Bellatrix. She looked frightening, 

mad; a thin stream of fire issued from her wand and burned a hole in the carpet. 

Narcissa hesitated for a moment, then addressed the werewolf. 

��Take these prisoners down to the cellar, Greyback.�� 

��Wait,�� said Bellatrix sharply. ��All except... except for the Mudblood.�� 

Greyback gave a grunt of pleasure. 

��No!�� shouted Ron. ��You can have me, keep me!�� 

Bellatrix hit him across the face, the blow echoed around the room. 

��If she dies under questioning, I��ll take you next,�� she said. ��Blood traitor is next to Mudblood 
in my book. Take them downstairs, Greyback, and make sure they are secure, but do nothing more 
to them �C yet.�� 

She threw Greyback��s wand back to him, then took a short silver knife from under her robes. 
She cut Hermione free from the other prisoners, then dragged her by the hair into the middle of the 
room, while Greyback forced the rest of them to shuffle across to another door, into a dark 
passageway, his wand held out in front of him, projecting an invisible and irresistible force. 

��Reckon she��ll let me have a bit of the girl when she��s finished with her?�� Greyback crooned as 
he forced them along the corridor. ��I��d say I��ll get a bite or two, wouldn��t you, ginger?�� 

Harry could feel Ron shaking. They were forced down a steep flight of stairs, still tied back-toback 
and in danger of slipping and breaking their necks at any moment. At the bottom was a heavy 
door. Greyback unlocked it with a tap of his wand, then forced them into a dank and musty room 
and left them in total darkness. The echoing bang of the slammed cellar door had not died away 
before there was a terrible, drawn out scream from directly above them. 

��HERMIONE!�� Ron bellowed, and he started to writhe and struggle against the ropes tying 
them together, so that Harry staggered. ��HERMIONE!�� 

��Be quiet!�� Harry said. ��Shut up. Ron, we need to work out a way �C��

��334ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��HERMIONE! HERMIONE!�� 

��We need a plan, stop yelling �C we need to get these ropes off �C�� 

��Harry?�� came a whisper through the darkness. ��Ron? Is that you?�� 

Ron stopped shouting. There was a sound of movement close by them, then Harry saw a shadow 
moving closer. 

��Harry? Ron?�� 

��Luna?�� 

��Yes, it��s me! Oh no, I didn��t want you to be caught!�� 

��Luna, can you help us get these ropes off?�� said Harry. 

��Oh yes, I expect so. There��s an old nail we use if we need to break anything... Just a 
moment ...�� 

Hermione screamed again from overhead, and they could hear Bellatrix screaming too, but her 
words were inaudible, for Ron shouted again, ��HERMIONE! HERMIONE!�� 

��Mr. Ollivander?�� Harry could hear Luna saying. ��Mr. Ollivander, have you got the nail? If you 
just move over a little bit ... I think it was beside the water jug.�� 

She was back within seconds. 

��You��ll need to stay still,�� she said. 

Harry could feel her digging at the rope��s tough fibers to work the knots free. From upstairs they 

heard Bellatrix��s voice. 

��I��m going to ask you again! Where did you get this sword? Where?�� 

��We found it �C we found it �C PLEASE!�� Hermione screamed again; Ron struggled harder than 

ever, and the rusty nail slipped onto Harry��s wrist. 

��Ron, please stay still!�� Luna whispered. ��I can��t see what I��m doing �C�� 

��My pocket!�� said Ron, ��In my pocket, there��s a Deluminator, and it��s full of light!�� 

A few seconds later, there was a click, and the luminescent spheres the Deluminator had sucked 
from the lamps in the tent flew into the cellar. Unable to rejoin their sources, they simply hung 
there, like tiny suns, flooding the underground room with light. Harry saw Luna, all eyes in her 
white face, and the motionless figure of Ollivander the wandmaker, curled up on the floor in the 
corner. Craning around, he caught sight of their fellow prisoners, Dean and Griphook the goblin, 
who seemed barely conscious, kept standing by the ropes that bound him to the humans.

��335ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Oh, that��s much easier, thanks, Ron,�� said Luna, and she began hacking at their bindings again. 

��Hello, Dean!�� 

From above came Bellatrix��s voice. 

��You��re lying, filthy Mudblood, and I know it! You have been inside my vault at Gringotts! Tell 

the truth, tell the truth!�� 

Another terrible scream. 

��HERMIONE!�� 

��What else did you take? What else have you got? Tel me the truth or, I swear, I shall run you 

through with this knife!�� 

��There!�� 

Harry felt the ropes fall away and turned, rubbing his wrists, to see Ron running around the 
cellar, looking up at the low ceiling, searching for a trapdoor. Dean, his face bruised and bloody, 
said ��Thanks�� to Luna and stood there, shivering, but Griphook sank onto the cellar floor, looking 
groggy and disoriented, many welts across his swarthy face. 

Ron was now trying to Disapparate without a wand. 

��There��s no way out, Ron,�� said Luna, watching his fruitless efforts. ��The cellar is completely 
escape-proof. I tried, at first. Mr. Ollivander has been here for a long time, he��s tried everything.�� 

Hermione was screaming again. The sound went through Harry like physical pain. Barely 
conscious of the fierce prickling of his scar, he too started to run around the cellar, feeling the 
walls for he hardly knew what, knowing in his heart that it was useless. 

��What else did you take, what else? ANSWER ME! CRUCIO!�� 

Hermione��s screams echoed off the walls upstairs, Ron was half sobbing as he pounded the 
walls with his fists, and Harry in utter desperation seized Hagrid��s pouch from around his neck and 
groped inside it. He pulled out Dumbledore��s Snitch and shook it, hoping for he did not know what 

�C nothing happened �C he waved the broken halves of the phoenix wand, but they were lifeless �C the 
mirror fragment fell sparkling to the floor, and he saw a gleam of brightest blue �C 
Dumbledore��s eye was gazing at him out of the mirror. 
��Help us!�� he yelled at it in mad desperation. ��We��re in the cellar of Malfoy Manor, help us!�� 
The eye blinked and was gone. 
Harry was not even sure that it had really been there. He tilted the shard of mirror this way and

��336ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

that, and saw nothing reflected there but the walls and ceiling of their prison, and upstairs 
Hermione was screaming worse than ever, and next to him Ron was bellowing, ��HERMIONE! 
HERMIONE!�� 

��How did you get into my vault?�� they heard Bellatrix scream. ��Did that dirty little goblin in the 
cellar help you?�� 

��We only met him tonight!�� Hermione sobbed. ��We��ve never been inside your vault... It isn��t 
the real sword! It��s a copy, just a copy!�� 

��A copy?�� screeched Bellatrix. ��Oh, a likely story!�� 

��But we can find out easily!�� came Lucius��s voice. ��Draco, fetch the goblin, he can tell us 

whether the sword is real or not!�� 

Harry dashed across the cellar to where Griphook was huddled on the floor. 

��Griphook,�� he whispered into the goblin��s pointed ear, ��you must tell them that sword��s a fake, 
they mustn��t know it��s the real one, Griphook, please �C�� 

He could hear someone scuttling own the cellar steps; next moment, Draco��s shaking voice 
spoke from behind the door. 

��Stand back. Line up against the back wall. Don��t try anything, or I��ll kill you!�� 

They did as they were bidden; as the lock turned, Ron clicked the Deluminator and the lights 
whisked back into his pocket, restoring the cellar��s darkness. The door flew open; Malfoy marched 
inside, wand held out in front of him, pale and determined. He seized the little goblin by the arm 
and backed out again, dragging Griphook with him. The door slammed shut and at the same 
moment a loud crack echoed inside the cellar. 

Ron clicked the Deluminator. Three balls of light flew back into the air from his pocket, 

revealing Dobby the house-elf, who had just Apparated into their midst. 

��DOB �C !�� 

Harry hit Ron on the arm to stop him shouting, and Ron looked terrified at his mistake. 
Footsteps crossed the ceiling overhead, Draco marching Griphook to Bellatrix. 

Dobby��s enormous, tennis-ball shaped eyes were wide; he was trembling from his feet to the 
tips of his ears. He was back in the home of his old masters, and it was clear that he was petrified. 

��Harry Potter,�� he squeaked in the tiniest quiver of a voice, ��Dobby has come to rescue you.�� 

��But how did you �C?��

��337ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

An awful scream drowned Harry��s words, Hermione was being tortured again. He cut to the 

essentials. 

��You can Disapparate out of this cellar?�� he asked Dobby, who nodded, his ears flapping. 

��And you can take humans with you?�� 

Dobby nodded again. 

��Right. Dobby, I want you to grab Luna, Dean, and Mr. Ollivander, and take them �C take them 

to �C�� 

��Bill and Fleur��s,�� said Ron. ��Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth!�� 

The elf nodded for a third time. 

��And then come back,�� said Harry. ��Can you do that, Dobby?�� 

��Of course, Harry Potter,�� whispered the little elf. He hurried over to Mr. Ollivander, who 

appeared to be barely conscious. He took one of the wandmaker��s hands in his own, then held out 

the other to Luna and Dean, neither of whom moved. 

��Harry, we want to help you!�� Luna whispered. 

��We can��t leave you here,�� said Dean. 

��Go, both of you! We��ll see you at Bill and Fleur��s.�� 

As Harry spoke, his scar burned worse than ever, and for a few seconds he looked down, not 

upon the wandmaker, but on another man who was just as old, just as thin, but laughing scornfully. 

��Kill me, then. Voldemort, I welcome death! But my death will not bring you what you seek. 
There is so much you do not understand...�� 

He felt Voldemort��s fury, but as Hermione screamed again he shut it out, returning to the cellar 

and the horror of his own present. 

��Go!�� Harry beseeched to Luna and Dean. ��Go! We��ll follow, just go!�� 

They caught hold of the elf��s outstretched fingers. There was another loud crack, and Dobby, 
Luna, Dean, and Ollivander vanished. 

��What was that?�� shouted Lucius Malfoy from over their heads. ��Did you hear that? What was 
that noise in the cellar?�� 

Harry and Ron stared at each other. 

��Draco �C no, call Wormtail! Make him go and check!�� 

Footsteps crossed the room overhead, then there was silence. Harry knew that the people in the

��338ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

drawing room were listening for more noises from the cellar. 

��We��re going to have to try and tackle him,�� he whispered to Ron. They had no choice. The 
moment anyone entered the room and saw the absence of three prisoners, they were lost. ��Leave 
the lights on,�� Harry added, and as they heard someone descending the steps outside the door, they 
backed against the wall on either side of it. 

��Stand back,�� came Wormtail��s voice. ��Stand away from the door. I��m coming in.�� The door 
flew open. For a split second Wormtail gazed into the apparently empty cellar, ablaze with light 
from the three miniature suns floating in midair. Then Harry and Ron launched themselves upon 
him. Ron seized Wormtail��s wand arm and forced it upwards. Harry slapped a hand to his mouth, 
muffling his voice. Silently they struggled, Wormtail��s wand emitted sparks; his silver hand closed 
around Harry��s throat. 

��What is it, Wormtail?�� called Lucius Malfoy from above. 

��Nothing!�� Ron called back, in a passable imitation of Wormtail��s wheezy voice. ��All fine!�� 

Harry could barely breathe. 

��You��re going to kill me?�� Harry choked, attempting to prise off the metal fingers. ��After I 
saved your life? You owe me, Wormtail!�� 

The silver fingers slackened. Harry had not expected it. He wrenched himself free, astonished, 
keeping his hand over Wormtail��s mouth. He saw the rat-like man��s small watery eyes widen with 
fear and surprise. He seemed just as shocked as Harry at what his hand had done, at the tiny, 
merciful impulse it had betrayed, and he continued to struggle more powerfully, as though to undo 
that moment of weakness. 

��And we��ll have that,�� whispered Ron, tugging Wormtail��s wand from his other hand. 

Wandless, helpless, Pettigrew��s pupils dilated in terror. His eyes had slid from Harry��s face to 
something else. His own silver fingers were moving inexorably toward his own throat. 

��No �C�� 

Without pausing to think, Harry tried to drag back the hand, but there was no stopping it. The 
silver tool that Voldemort had given his most cowardly servant had turned upon its disarmed and 
useless owner; Pettigrew was reaping his reward for his hesitation, his moment of pity; he was 
being strangled before their eyes. 

��No!��

��339ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Ron had released Wormtail too, and together he and Harry tried to pull the crushing metal 
fingers from around Wormtail��s throat, but it was no use. Pettigrew was turning blue. 

��Relashio!�� said Ron, pointing the wand at the silver hand, but nothing happened; Pettigrew 
dropped to his knees, and at the same moment, Hermione gave a dreadful scream from overhead. 
Wormtail��s eyes rolled upward in his purple face; he gave a last twitch, and was still. 

Harry and Ron looked at each other, then leaving Wormtail��s body on the floor behind them, ran 
up the stairs and back into the shadowy passageway leading to the drawing room. Cautiously they 
crept along it until they reached the drawing room door, which was ajar. Now they had a clear 
view of Bellatrix looking down at Griphook, who was holding Gryffindor��s sword in his long-
fingered hands. Hermione was lying at Bellatrix��s feet. She was barely stirring. 

��Well?�� Bellatrix said to Griphook. ��Is it the true sword?�� 

Harry waited, holding his breath, fighting against the prickling of his scar. 

��No,�� said Griphook. ��It is a fake.�� 

��Are you sure?�� panted Bellatrix. ��Quite sure?�� 

��Yes,�� said the goblin. 

Relief broke across her face, all tension drained from it. 

��Good,�� she said, and with a casual flick of her wand she slashed another deep cut into the 
goblin��s face, and he dropped with a yell at her feet. She kicked him aside. ��And now,�� she said in 

a voice that burst with triumph, ��we call the Dark Lord!�� 

And she pushed back her sleeve and touched her forefinger to the Dark Mark. 

At once, Harry��s scar felt as though it had split open again. His true surroundings vanished, He 
was Voldemort, and the skeletal wizard before him was laughing toothlessly at him; he was 
enraged at the summons he felt �C he had warned them, he had told them to summon him for 
nothing less than Potter. If they were mistaken ... 

��Kill me, then!�� demanded the old man. ��You will not win, you cannot win! That wand will 
never, ever be yours �C�� 

And Voldemort��s fury broke. A burst of green light filled the prison room and the frail old body 
was lifted from its hard bed and then fell back, lifeless, and Voldemort returned to the window, his 
wrath barely controllable. They would suffer his retribution if they had no good reason for calling 
him back.

��And I think,�� said Bellatrix��s voice, ��we can dispose of the Mudblood. Greyback, take her if 

you want her.�� 

��NOOOOOOOOOOOO!�� 

Ron had burst into the drawing room; Bellatrix looked around, shocked; she turned her wand to 

face Ron instead �C 

��Expelliarmus!�� he roared, pointing Wormtail��s wand at Bellatrix, and hers flew into the air and 
was caught by Harry, who had sprinted after Ron. Lucius, Narcissa, Draco and Greyback wheeled 
about; Harry yelled, ��Stupefy!�� and Lucius Malfoy collapsed onto the hearth. Jets of light flew 
from Draco��s, Narcissa��s, and Greyback��s wands; Harry threw himself to the floor, rolling behind 
a sofa to avoid them. 

��STOP OR SHE DIES! 

Panting, Harry peered around the edge of the sofa. Bellatrix was supporting Hermione, who 
seemed to be unconscious, and was holding her short silver knife to Hermione��s throat. 

��Drop your wands,�� she whispered. ��Drop them, or we��ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!�� 

Ron stood rigid, clutching Wormtail��s wand. Harry straightened up, still holding Bellatrix��s. 

��I said, drop them!�� she screeched, pressing the blade into Hermione��s throat, Harry saw beads 
of blood appear there. 

��All right!�� he shouted, and he dropped Bellatrix��s wand onto the floor at his feet, Ron did the 
same with Wormtail��s. Both raised their hands to shoulder height. 

��Good!�� she leered. ��Draco, pick them up! The Dark Lord is coming, Harry Potter! Your death 
approaches!�� 

Harry knew it; his scar was bursting with the pain of it, and he could feel Voldemort flying 
through the sky from far away, over a dark and stormy sea, and soon he would be close enough to 
Apparate to them, and Harry could see no way out. 

��Now,�� said Bellatrix softly, as Draco hurried back to her with the wands. ��Cissy, I think we 
ought to tie these little heroes up again, while Greyback takes care of Miss Mudblood. I am sure 
the Dark Lord will not begrudge��ϧ 
you the girl, Greyback, after what you have done tonight.�� 

At the last word there was a peculiar grinding noise from above. All of them looked upward in 
time to see the crystal chandelier tremble; then, with a creak and an ominous jingling, it began to 
fall. Bellatrix was directly beneath it; dropping Hermione, she threw herself aside with a scream.

��341ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The chandelier crashed to the floor in an explosion of crystal and chains, falling on top of 
Hermione and the goblin, who still clutched the sword of Gryffindor. Glittering shards of crystal 
flew in all directions; Draco doubled over, his hands covering his bloody face. 

As Ron ran to pull Hermione out of the wreckage, Harry took the chance, He leapt over an 
armchair and wrested the three wands from Draco��s grip, pointed all of them at Greyback, and 
yelled, ��Stupefy!�� The werewolf was lifted off his feet by the triple spell, flew up to the ceiling and 
then smashed to the ground. 

As Narcissa dragged Draco out of the way of further harm, Bellatrix sprang to her feet, her hair 

flying as she brandished the silver knife; but Narcissa had directed her wand at the doorway. 

��Dobby!�� she screamed and even Bellatrix froze. ��You! You dropped the chandelier �C?�� 

The tiny elf trotted into the room, his shaking finger pointing at his old mistress. 

��You must not hurt Harry Potter,�� he squeaked. 

��Kill him, Cissy!�� shrieked Bellatrix, but there was another loud crack, and Narcissa��s wand too 
flew into the air and landed on the other side of the room. 

��You dirty little monkey!�� bawled Bellatrix. ��How dare you take a witch��s wand, how dare you 
defy your masters?�� 

��Dobby has no master!�� squealed the elf. ��Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save 
Harry Potter and his friends!�� 

Harry��s scar was blinding him with pain. Dimly he knew that they had moments, seconds before 
Voldemort was with them. 

��Ron, catch �C and GO!�� he yelled, throwing one of the wands to him; then he bent down to tug 
Griphook out from under the chandelier. Hoisting the groaning goblin, who still clung to the 
sword, over one shoulder, Harry seized Dobby��s hand and spun on the spot to Disapparate. 

As he turned into darkness he caught one last view of the drawing room of the pale, frozen 
figures of Narcissa and Draco, of the streak of red that was Ron��s hair, and a blue of flying silver, 
as Bellatrix��s knife flew across the room at the place where he was vanishing. 

Bill and Fleur��s ... Shell Cottage ... Bill and Fleur��s ... 

He had disappeared into the unknown; all he could do was repeat the name of the destination 
and hope that it would suffice to take him there. The pain in his forehead pierced him, and the 
weight of the goblin bore down upon him; he could feel the blade of Gryffindor��s sword bumping

against his back, Dobby��s hand jerked in his; he wondered whether the elf was trying to take 
charge, to pull them in the right direction, and tried, by squeezing the fingers, to indicate that that 
was fine with them. 

And then they hit solid earth and smelled salty air. Harry fell to his knees, relinquished Dobby��s 

hand, and attempted to lower Griphook gently to the ground. 

��Are you all right?�� he said as the goblin stirred, but Griphook merely whimpered. 

Harry squinted around through the darkness. There seemed to be a cottage a short way away 
under the wide starry sky, and he thought he saw movement outside it. 

��Dobby, is this Shell Cottage?�� he whispered, clutching the two wands he had brought from the 
Malfoys��, ready to fight if he needed to. ��Have we come to the right place? Dobby?�� 

He looked around. The little elf stood feet from him. 

��DOBBY!�� 

The elf swayed slightly, stars reflected in his wide, shining eyes. Together, he and Harry looked 
down at the silver hilt of the knife protruding from the elf��s heaving chest. 

��Dobby �C no �C HELP!�� Harry bellowed toward the cottage, toward the people moving there. 
��HELP!�� 

He did not know or care whether they were wizards or Muggles, friends or foes; all he cared 
about was that a dark stain was spreading across Dobby��s front, and that he had stretched out his 
own arms to Harry with a look of supplication (earnest request). Harry caught him and laid him 
sideways on the cool grass. 

��Dobby, no, don��t die, don��t die �C�� 

The elf��s eyes found him, and his lips trembled with the effort to form words. 

��Harry ... Potter ...�� 

And then with a little shudder the elf became quite still, and his eyes were nothing more than 
great glassy orbs, sprinkled with light from the stars they could not see.

Chapter Twenty-Four 
The Wandmaker 


It was like sinking into an old nightmare; for 


an instant 
Harry knelt again beside Dumbledore��s body at 

the foot of 
the tallest tower at Hogwarts, but in reality he 

was staring at 
a tiny body curled upon the grass, pierced by 

Bellatrix��s 
silver knife. Harry��s voice was still saying, 

��Dobby... 
Dobby...�� even though he knew that the elf had 

gone where 
he could not call him back. 

After a minute or so he realized that they had, after all, come to the right place, for here were 
Bill and Fleur, Dean and Luna, gathering around him as he knelt over the elf. ��Hermione,�� he said 
suddenly. ��Where is she?�� 

��Ron��s taken her inside,�� said Bill. ��She��ll be all right.�� Harry looked back down at Dobby. He 
stretched out a hand and pulled the sharp blade from the elf��s body, then dragged off his own 
jacket and covered Dobby in it like a blanket. 

The sea was rushing against the rock somewhere nearby; Harry listened to it while the others 
talked, discussing matters in which he could take no interest, making decisions. Dean carried the 
injured Griphook into the house, Fleur hurrying with them; now Bill was making sugegstions 
about bury the elf. Harry agreed without really knowing what he was saying. As he did so, he 
gazed down at the tiny body, and his scar prickled and burned, and in one part of his mind, viewed 
as if from the wrong end of a long telescope, he saw Voldemort punishing those they had left 
behind at the Malfoy Manor. His rage was dreadful and yet Harry��s grief for Dobby seemed to 
diminish it, so that it became a distant storm that reached Harry from across a vast, silent ocean. 

��I want to do it properly,�� were the first words of which Harry was fully conscious of speaking. 
��Not by magic. Have you got a spade?�� And shortly afterward he had set to work, alone, digging 
the grave in the place that Bill had shown him at the end of the garden, between bushes. He dug 
with a kind of fury, relishing the manual work, glorying in the non-magic of it, for every drop of 
his sweat and every blister felt like a gift to the elf who had saved their lives. 

His scar burned, but he was master of the pain, he felt it, yet was apart from it. He had learned

��344ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

control at last, learned to shut his mind to Voldemort, the very thing Dumbledore had wanted him 
to learn from Snape. Just as Voldemort had not been able to possess Harry while Harry was 
consumed with grief for Sirius, so his thoughts could not penetrate Harry now while he mourned 
Dobby. Grief, it seemed, drove Voldemort out... though Dumbledore, of course, would have said 
that it was love. 

On Harry dug, deeper and deeper into the hard, cold earth, subsuming (include,��...�������� 
) 
his grief in sweat, denying the pain in his scar. In the darkness, with nothing but the sound of his 
own breath and the rushing sea to keep him company, the things that had happened at the Malfoys�� 
returned to him, the things he had heard came back to him, and understanding blossomed in the 
darkness... 

The steady rhythm of his arms beat time������ with his thoughts. Hallows... Horcruxes... 
Hallows... Horcruxes... yet no longer burned with that weird, obsessive longing. Loss and fear had 
snuffed it out. He felt as though he had been slapped awake again. 

Deeper and deeper Harry sank into the grave, and he knew where Voldemort had been tonight, 
and whom he had killed in the topmost cell of Nurmengard, and why... 

And he thought of Wormtail, dead because of one small unconscious impulse of mercy... 
Dumbledore had foreseen that... How much more had he known? 

Harry lost track of time. He knew only that the darkness had lightened a few degrees when he 
was rejoined by Ron and Dean. ��How��s Hermione?�� 

��Better,�� said Ron. ��Fleur��s looking after her.�� 

Harry had his retort ready for when they asked him why he had not simply created a perfect 
grave with his wand, but he did not need it. They jumped down into the hole he had made with 
spades of their own and together they worked in silence until the hole seemed deep enough. 

Harry wrapped the elf more snuggly in his jacket. Ron sat on the edge of the grave and stripped 
off his shoes and socks, which he placed on the elf��s bare feet. Dean produced a woolen hat, which 
Harry placed carefully upon Dobby��s head, muffling his batlike ears. ��We should close his eyes.��

 Harry had not heard the others coming through the darkness. Bill was wearing a traveling cloak, 
Fleur a large white apron, from the pocket of which protruded a bottle of what Harry recognized to 
be Skele-Gro. Hermione was wrapped in a borrowed dressing gown, pale and unsteady on her feet; 
Ron put an arm around her when she reached him. Luna, who was huddled in one of Fleur��s coats,

��345ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

crouched down and placed her fingers tenderly upon each of the elf��s eyelids, sliding them over his 
glassy stare. ��There,�� she said softly. ��Now he could be sleeping.�� 

Harry placed the elf into the grave, arranged his tiny limbs so that he might have been resting, 
then climbed out and gazed for the last time upon the little body. He forced himself not to break 
down as he remembered Dumbledore��s funeral, and the rows and rows of golden chairs, and the 
Minister of Magic in the front row, the recitation of Dumbledore��s achievements, the stateliness of 
the white marble tomb. He felt that Dobby deserved just as grand a funeral, and yet here the elf lay 
between bushes in a roughly dug hole. ��I think we ought to say something,�� piped up Luna. ��I��ll 
go first, shall I?�� 

And as everybody looked at her, she addressed the dead elf at the bottom of the grave. ��Thank 
you so much Dobby for rescuing me from that cellar. It��s so unfair that you had to die when you 
were so good and brave. I��ll always remember what you did for us. I hope you��re happy now.�� 

She turned and looked expectingly at Ron, who cleared his throat and said in a thick voice, 

��yeah... thanks Dobby.�� 

��Thanks,�� muttered Dean. 

Harry swallowed. ��Good bye Dobby,�� he said. It was all he could manage, but Luna had said it 
all for him. Bill raised his wand, and the pile of earth beside the grave rose up into the air and fell 
neatly upon it, a small, reddish mound. 

��D��ya mind if I stay here a moment?�� He asked the others. 

They murmured words he did not catch; he felt gentle pats upon his back, and then they all 
traipsed back toward the cottage, leaving Harry alone beside the elf. 

He looked around. There were a number of large white stones, smoothed by the sea, marking 
the edge of the flower beds. He picked up one of the largest and laid it, pillowlike, over the place 
where Dobby��s head now rested. He then felt in his pocket for a wand. There were two in there. He 
had forgotten, lost track; he could not now remember whose wands these were; he seemed to 
remember wrenching them out of someone��s hand. He selected the shorter of the two, which felt 
friendlier in his hand, and pointed it at the rock. 

Slowly, under his murmured instruction, deep cuts appeared upon the rock��s surface. He knew 
that Hermione could have done it more neatly, and probably more quickly, but he wanted to mark 
the spot as he had wanted to dig the grave. When Harry stood up again, the stone read, HERE

LIES DOBBY, A FREE ELF. 

He looked at his handiwork for a few more seconds, then walked away, his scar still prickling a 
little, and his mind full of those things that had come to him in the grave, ideas that had taken 
shape in the darkness, ideas both fascinating and terrible. 

They were all sitting in the living room when he entered the little hall, their attention focused 
upon Bill, who was talking. The room was light-colored, pretty, with a small fire of driftwood 
burning brightly in the fireplace. Harry did not want to drop mud upon the carpet, so he stood in 
the doorway, listening. 

��... lucky that Ginny��s on holiday. If she��d been at Hogwarts they could have taken her before 
we reached her. Now we know she��s safe too.�� He looked around and saw Harry standing there. 
��I��ve been getting them all out of the Burrow,�� he explained. ��Moved them to Muriel��s. The Death 
Eaters know Ron��s with you now, they��re bound to target the family �C don��t apologize,�� he added 
at the sight of Harry��s expression. ��It was always a matter of time, Dad��s been saying so for 
months. We��re the biggest blood traitor family there is.�� 

��How are they protected?�� asked Harry. 

��Fidelius Charm. Dad��s Secret-Keeper. And we��ve done it on this cottage too; I��m Secret-
Keeper here. None of us can go to work, but that��s hardly the most important thing now. Once 
Ollivander and Griphook are well enough, we��ll move them to Muriel��s too. There isn��t much 
room here, but she��s got plenty. Griphook��s legs are on the mend. Fleur��s given him Skele-Gro, we 
could probably move them in an hour or -�� 

��No,�� Harry said and Bill looked startled. ��I need both of them here. I need to talk to them. It��s 
important.�� He heard the authority of his own voice, the conviction, the voice of purpose that had 
come to him as he dug Dobby��s grave. All of their faces were turned toward him looking puzzled. 

��I��m going to wash,�� Harry told Bill looking down at his hands still covered with mud and 
Dobby��s blood. ��Then I��ll need to see them, straight away.�� He walked into the little kitchen, to 
the basin beneath a window overlooking the sea. Dawn was breaking over the horizon, shell pink 
and faintly gold, as he washed, again following the train of thought that had come to him in the 
dark garden... 

Dobby would never be able to tell them who had sent him to the cellar, but Harry knew what he 
had seen. A piercing blue eye had looked out of the mirror fragment, and then help had come.

��347ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it. 

Harry dried his hands, impervious to the beauty of the scene outside the window and to the 
murmuring of the others in the sitting room. He looked out over the ocean and felt closer, this 
dawn, than ever before, closer to the heart of it all. 

And still his scar prickled, and he knew that Voldemort was getting there too. Harry understood 
and yet did not understand. His instinct was telling him one thing, his brain quite another. The 
Dumbledore in Harry��s head smiled, surveying Harry over the tips of his fingers, pressed together 
as if in prayer. 

You gave Ron the Deluminator... You understood him... You gave him a way back... 

And you understood Wormtail too... You knew there was a bit of regret there, somewhere... 

And if you knew them... What did you know about me, Dumbledore? 

Am I meant to know but not to seek? Did you know how hard I��d feel that? Is that why you made 
it this difficult? So I��d have time to work that out? 

Harry stood quite still, eyes glazed, watching the place where a bright gold ray of dazzling sun 
was rising over the horizon. Then he looked down at his clean hands and was momentarily 
surprised to see the cloth he was holding in them. He set it down and returned to the hall, and as he 
did so, he felt his scar pulse angrily, and then flashed across his mind, swift as the reflection of a 
dragonfly over water, the outline of a building he knew extremely well.

 Bill and Fleur were standing at the foot of the stairs. 

 ��I need to speak to Griphook and Ollivander,�� Harry said.

 ��No,�� said Fleur. ��You will 'ave to wait, 'Arry. Zey are both too tired �C�� 

��I��m sorry,�� he said without heat, ��but it can��t wait. I need to talk to them now. Privately �C and 
separately. It��s urgent.�� 

��Harry, what the hell��s going on?�� asked Bill. ��You turn up here with a dead house-elf and a 
half-conscious goblin, Hermione looks as though she��s been tortured, and Ron��s just refused to tell 
me anything �C�� 

��We can��t tell you what we��re doing,�� said Harry flatly. ��You��re in the Order, Bill, you know 
Dumbledore left us a mission. We��re not supposed to talk about it to anyone else.�� 

Fleur made an impatient noise, but Bill did not look at her; he was staring at Harry. His deeply 
scarred face was hard to read. Finally, Bill said, ��All right. Who do you want to talk to first?��

��348ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry hesitated. He knew what hung on his decision. There was hardly any time left; now was 

the moment to decide, Horcruxes or Hallows.

 ��Griphook,�� Harry said. ��I��ll speak to Griphook first.��

 His heart was racing as if he had been sprinting and had just cleared an enormous obstacle.

 ��Up here, then,�� said Bill, leading the way.

 Harry had walked up several steps before stopping and looking back. 

��I need you two as well!�� he called to Ron and Hermione, who had been skulking��� 
, half 
concealed, in the doorway of the sitting room.

 They both moved into the light, looking oddly relieved. 

��How are you?�� Harry asked Hermione. ��You were amazing �C coming up with that story when 

she was hurting you like that �C��

 Hermione gave a weak smile as Ron gave her a one-armed squeeze.

 ��What are we doing now, Harry?�� he asked. 

 ��You��ll see. Come on.�� 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed Bill up the steep stairs onto a small landing. Three doors 

led off it. 

��In here,�� said Bill, opening the door into his and Fleur��s room, it too had a view of the sea, 
now flecked with gold in the sunrise. Harry moved to the window, turned his back on the 
spectacular view, and waited, his arms folded, his scar prickling. Hermione took the chair beside 
the dressing table; Ron sat on the arm. 

Bill reappeared, carrying the little goblin, whom he set down carefully upon the bed. Griphook 

grunted thanks, and Bill left, closing the door upon them all.

 ��I��m sorry to take you out of bed,�� said Harry. ��How are your legs?��

 ��Painful,�� replied the goblin. ��But mending.�� 

He was still clutching the sword of Gryffindor, and wore a strange look, half truculent (cruel; 
harsh), half intrigued. Harry noted the goblin��s sallow skin, his long thin fingers, his black eyes. 
Fleur had removed his shoes, His long feet were dirty. He was larger than a house-elf, but not by 
much. His domed head was much bigger than a human��s.

 ��You probably don��t remember �C�� Harry began. 

��-that I was the goblin who showed you to your vault, the first time you ever visited

��349ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Gringotts?�� said Griphook. ��I remember, Harry Potter. Even amongst goblins, you are very 
famous.�� 

Harry and the goblin looked at each other, sizing each other up���� 
. Harry��s scar was still 
prickling. He wanted to get through this interview with Griphook quickly, and at the same time 
was afraid of making a false move. While he tried to decide on the best way to approach his 
request, the goblin broke the silence. 

��You buried the elf,�� he said, sounding unexpectedly rancorous (bitter, resentful). ��I watched 

you from the window of the bedroom next door.��

 ��Yes,�� said Harry.

 Griphook looked at him out of the corners of his slanting black eyes.

 ��You are an unusual wizard, Harry Potter.��

 ��In what way?�� asked Harry, rubbing his scar absently.

 ��You dug the grave.��

 ��So?�� 

Griphook did not answer. Harry rather thought he was being sneered at for acting like a 
Muggle, but it did not matter to him whether Griphook approved of Dobby��s grave or not. He 
gathered himself for the attack. ��Griphook, I need to ask �C��

 ��You also rescued a goblin.��

 ��What?��

 ��You brought me here. Saved me.��

 ��Well, I take it you��re not sorry?�� said Harry a little impatiently. 

��No, Harry Potter,�� said Griphook, and with one finger he twisted the thin black beard upon his 
chin, ��but you are a very odd wizard.��

 ��Right,�� said Harry. ��Well, I need some help, Griphook, and you can give it to me.�� 

The goblin made no sign of encouragement, but continued to frown at Harry as though he had 

never seen anything like him.

 ��I need to break into a Gringotts vault.��

 Harry had not meant to say it so badly, the words were forced from him as pain shot through his 
lightning scar and he saw, again, the outline of Hogwarts. He closed his mind firmly. He needed to 
deal with Griphook first.

��350ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry as though he had gone mad.

 ��Harry �C�� said Hermione, but she was cut off by Griphook. 

��Break into a Gringotts vault?�� repeated the goblin, wincing a little as he shifted his position 
upon the bed. ��It is impossible.��

 ��No, it isn��t,�� Ron contradicted him. ��It��s been done.��

 ��Yeah,�� said Harry. ��The same day I first met you, Griphook. My birthday, seven years ago.�� 

��The vault in question was empty at the time,�� snapped the goblin, and Harry understood that 
even though Griphook had left Gringotts, he was offended at the idea of its defenses being 
breached. ��Its protection was minimal.�� 

��Well, the vault we need to get into isn��t empty, and I��m guessing its protection will be pretty 
powerful,�� said Harry. ��It belongs to the Lestranges.�� 

He saw Hermione and Ron look at each other, astonished, but there would be time enough to 
explain after Griphook had given his answer. 

��You have no chance,�� said Griphook flatly. ��No chance at all. If you seek beneath our floors, 
a treasure that was never yours �C�� 

��Thief, you have been warned, beware �C yeah, I know, I remember,�� said Harry. ��But I��m not 
trying to get myself any treasure, I��m not trying to take anything for personal gain. Can you 
believe that?�� 

The goblin looked slantwise at Harry, and the lightning scar on Harry��s forehead prickled, but 
he ignored it, refusing to acknowledge its pain or its invitation. 

��If there was a wizard of whom I would believe that they did not seek personal gain,�� said 
Griphook finally, ��it would be you, Harry Potter. Goblins and elves are not used to the protection 
or the respect that you have shown this night. Not from wand-carriers.�� 

��Wand-carriers,�� repeated Harry, The phrase fell oddly upon his ears as his scar prickled, as 
Voldemort turned his thoughts northward, and as Harry burned to question Ollivander next door. 

��The right to carry a wand,�� said the goblin quietly, ��has long been contested between wizards 
and goblins.��

 ��Well, goblins can do magic without wands,�� said Ron. 

 ��That is immaterial! Wizards refuse to share the secrets of wand-lore with other magical beings, 

they deny us the possibility of extending our powers!��

��351ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Well, goblins won��t share any of their magic either,�� said Ron. ��You won��t tell us how to 
make swords and armor the way you do. Goblins know how to work metal in a way wizards have 
never �C�� 

��It doesn��t matter,�� said Harry, noting Griphook��s rising color. ��This isn��t about wizards versus 

goblins or any other sort of magical creature �C��

 Griphook gave a nasty laugh. 

��But it is, it is precisely that! As the Dark Lord becomes ever more powerful, your race is set 
still more firmly above mine! Gringotts falls under Wizarding rule, house-elves are slaughtered, 
and who amongst the wand-carriers protests?�� 

��We do!�� said Hermione. She had sat up straight, her eyes bright. ��We protest! And I��m hunted 
quite as much as any goblin or elf, Griphook! I��m a Mudblood!��

 ��Don��t call yourself �C�� Ron muttered. 

��Why shouldn��t I?�� said Hermione. ��Mudblood, and proud of it! I��ve got no higher position 
under this new order than you have, Griphook! It was me they chose to torture, back at the 
Malfoys!�� 

As she spoke, she pulled aside the neck of the dressing gown to reveal the thin cut Bellatrix had 
made, scarlet against her throat. 

��Did you know that it was Harry who set Dobby free?�� she asked. ��Did you know that we��ve 
wanted elves to be freed for years?�� (Ron fidgeted uncomfortably on the arm of Hermione��s chair.) 
��You can��t want You-Know-Who defeated more than we do, Griphook!��

 The goblin gazed at Hermione with the same curiousity he had shown Harry.

 ��What do you seek within the Lestranges�� vault?�� he asked abruptly. ��The sword that lies inside 
it is a fake. This is the real one.�� He looked from one to the other of them. ��I think that you already 
know this. You asked me to lie for you back there.�� 

��But the fake sword isn��t the only thing in that vault, is it?�� asked Harry. ��Perhaps you��ve seen 
other things in there?�� 

His heart was pounding harder than ever. He redoubled his efforts to ignore the pulsing of his 
scar. 

 The goblin twisted his beard around his finger again. 

��It is against our code to speak of the secrets of Gringotts. We are the guardians of fabulous

treasures. We have a duty to the objects placed in our care, which were, so often, wrought by our 
fingers.�� 

The goblin stroked the sword, and his black eyes roved from Harry to Hermione to Ron and 
then back again.

 ��So young,�� he said finally, ��to be fighting so many.�� 

��Will you help us?�� said Harry. ��We haven��t got a hope of breaking in without a goblin��s help. 

You��re our one chance.��

 ��I shall ... think about it,�� said Griphook maddeningly.

 ��But �C�� Ron started angrily; Hermione nudged him in the ribs. 

 ��Thank you,�� said Harry.

 The goblin bowed his great domed head in acknowledgement, then flexed his short legs. 

��I think,�� he said, settling himself ostentatiously upon Bill and Fleur��s bed, ��that the Skele-Gro 

has finished its work. I may be able to sleep at last. Forgive me.�� 

��Yeah, of course,�� said Harry, but before leaving the room he leaned forward and took the 
sword of Gryffindor from beside the goblin. Griphook did not protest, but Harry thought he saw 
resentment in the goblin��s eyes as he closed the door upon him.

 ��Little git,�� whispered Ron. ��He��s enjoying keeping us hanging.�� 

��Harry,�� whispered Hermione, pulling them both away from the door, into the middle of the 
still-dark landing, ��are you saying what I think you��re saying? Are you saying there��s a Horcrux in 
the Lestranges vault?�� 

��Yes,�� said Harry. ��Bellatrix was terrified when she thought we��d been in there, she was beside 
herself. Why? What did she think we��d seen, what else did she think we might have taken? 
Something she was petrified You-Know-Who would find out about.�� 

��But I thought we were looking for places You-Know-Who��s been, places he��s done something 
important?�� said Ron, looking baffled. ��Was he ever inside the Lestranges�� vault?�� 

��I don��t know whether he was ever inside Gringotts,�� said Harry. ��He never had gold there 
when he was younger, because nobody left him anything. He would have seen the bank from the 
outside, though, the first time he ever went to Diagon Alley.�� 

Harry��s scar throbbed, but he ignored it; he wanted Ron and Hermione to understand about 
Gringotts before they spoke to Ollivander.

��353ҳ��

��I think he would have envied anyone who had a key to a Gringotts vault. I think he��d have 
seen it as a real symbol of belonging to the Wizarding world. And don��t forget, he trusted Bellatrix 
and her husband. They were his most devoted servants before he fell, and they went looking for 
him after he vanished. He said it the night he came back, I heard him.��

 Harry rubbed his scar. 

��I don��t think he��d have told Bellatrix it was a Horcrux, though. He never told Lucius Malfoy 
the truth about the diary. He probably told her it was a treasured possession and asked her to place 
it in her vault. The safest place in the world for anything you want to hide, Hagrid told me... except 
for Hogwarts.��

 When Harry had finished speaking, Ron shook his head. 

 ��You really understand him.�� 

��Bits of him,�� said Harry. ��Bits ... I just wish I��d understood Dumbledore as much. But we��ll 
see. Come on �C Ollivander now.�� 

Ron and Hermione looked bewildered but very impressed as they followed him across the little 
landing and knocked upon the door opposite Bill and Fleur��s. A weak ��Come in!�� answered them. 

The wandmaker was lying on the twin bed farthest from the window. He had been held in the 
cellar for more than a year, and tortured, Harry knew, on at least one occasion. He was emaciated, 
the bones of his face sticking out sharply against the yellowish skin. His great silver eyes seemed 
vast in their sunken sockets. The hands that lay upon the blanket could have belonged to a 
skeleton. Harry sat down on the empty bed, beside Ron and Hermione. The rising sun was not 
visible here. The room faced the cliff-top garden and the freshly dug grave. 

 ��Mr. Ollivander, I��m sorry to disturb you,�� Harry said. 

��My dear boy,�� Ollivander��s voice was feeble. ��You rescued us, I thought we would die in that 
place, I can never thank you ... never thank you ... enough.��

 ��We were glad to do it.�� 

Harry��s scar throbbed. He knew, he was certain, that there was hardly any time left in which to 
beat Voldemort to his goal, or else to attempt to thwart him. He felt a flutter of panic ... yet he had 
made his decision when he chose to speak to Griphook first. Feigning a calm he did not feel, he 
groped in the pouch around his neck and took out the two halves of his broken wand. 

 ��Mr. Ollivander, I need some help.��

��354ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Anything. Anything.�� Said the wandmaker weakly.

 ��Can you mend this? Is it possible?�� 

Ollivander held out a trembling hand, and Harry placed the two barely connected halves in his 
palm. 

��Holly and phoenix feather,�� said Ollivander in a tremulous voice. ��Eleven inches. Nice and 

supple.��

 ��Yes,�� said Harry. ��Can you -?�� 

��No,�� whispered Ollivander. ��I am sorry, very sorry, but a wand that has suffered this degree of 

damage cannot be repaired by any means that I know of.�� 

Harry had been braced to hear it, but it was a blow nevertheless. He took the wand halves back 
and replaced them in the pouch around his neck. Ollivander stared at the place where the shattered 
wand had vanished, and did not look away until Harry had taken from his pocket the two wands he 
had brought from the Malfoys��.

 ��Can you identify these?�� Harry asked. 

 The wandmaker took the first of the wands and held it close to his faded eyes, rolling it between 
his knobble-knuckled fingers, flexing it slightly. 

��Walnut and dragon heartstring,�� he said. ��Twelve and three quarter inches. Unyielding. This 
wand belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.��

 ��And this one?��

 Ollivander performed the same examination. 

��Hawthorn and unicorn hair. Ten inches precisely. Reasonably springy. This was the wand of 

Draco Malfoy.��

 ��Was?�� repeated Harry. ��Isn��t it still his?��

 ��Perhaps not. If you took it �C��

 ��- I did �C�� 

��-then it may be yours. Of course, the manner of taking matters. Much also depends upon the 
wand itself. In general, however, where a wand has been won, its allegiance will change.��

 There was a silence in the room, except for the distant rushing of the sea. 

��You talk about wands like they��ve got feelings,�� said Harry, ��like they can think for 
themselves.��

��355ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��The wand chooses the wizard,�� said Ollivander. ��That much has always been clear to those of 

us who have studied wandlore.��

 ��A person can still use a wand that hasn��t chosen them, though?�� asked Harry. 

��Oh yes, if you are any wizard at all you will be able to channel your magic through almost any 
instrument. The best results, however, must always come where there is the strongest affinity 
between wizard and wand. These connections are complex. An initial attraction, and then a mutual 
quest for experience, the wand learning from the wizard, the wizard from the wand.�� 

The sea gushed forward and backward; it was a mournful sound. ��I took this wand from Draco 
Malfoy by force,�� said Harry. ��Can I use it safely?�� 

��I think so. Subtle laws govern wand ownership, but the conquered wand will usually bend its 
will to its new master.�� 

��So I should use this one?�� said Ron, pulling Wormtail��s wand out of his pocket and handing it 
to Ollivander. 

��Chestnut and dragon heartstring. Nine-and-a-quarter inches. Brittle. I was forced to make this 
shortly after my kidnapping, for Peter Pettigrew. Yes, if you won it, it is more likely to do your 
bidding, and do it well, than another wand.��

 ��And this holds true for all wands, does it?�� asked Harry. 

��I think so,�� replied Ollivander, his protuberant eyes upon Harry��s face. ��You ask deep 
questions, Mr. Potter. Wandlore is a complex and mysterious branch of magic.�� 

��So, it isn��t necessary to kill the previous owner to take the possession of a wand?�� asked 
Harry.

 Ollivander swallowed.

 ��Necessary? No, I should not say that it is necessary to kill.�� 

��There are legends, though,�� said Harry, and as his heart rate quickened, the pain in his scar 
became more intense; he was sure that Voldemort has decided to put his idea into action. ��Legends 
about a wand �C or wands �C that have been passed from hand to hand by murder.�� 

Ollivander turned pale. Against the snowy pillow he was light gray, and his eyes were 
enormous, bloodshot, and bulging with what looked like fear. 

 ��Only one wand, I think,�� he whispered. 

 ��And You-Know-Who is interested in it, isn��t he?�� asked Harry.

��356ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I �C how?�� croaked Ollivander, and he looked appealingly at Ron and Hermione for help. ��How 

do you know this?��

 ��He wanted you to tell him how to overcome the connection between our wands,�� said Harry.

 Ollivander looked terrified. 

��He tortured me, you must understand that! The Cruciatus Curse, I �C I had no choice but to tell 
him what I knew, what I guessed!�� 

��I understand,�� said Harry. ��You told him about the twin cores? You said he just had to borrow 
another wizard��s wand?��

 Ollivander looked horrified, transfixed, by the amount that Harry knew. He nodded slowly. 

��But it didn��t work,�� Harry went on. ��Mine still beat the borrowed wand. Do you know why 

that is?��

 Ollivander shook his head slowly as he had just nodded. 

��I had ... never heard of such a thing. Your wand performed something unique that night. The 
connection of the twin cores is incredibly rare, yet why your wand would have snapped the 
borrowed wand, I do not know...�� 

��We were talking about the other wand, the wand that changes hands by murder. When YouKnow-
Who realized my wand had done something strange, he came back and asked about that 
other wand, didn��t he?�� 

��How do you know this?��

 Harry did not answer. 

��Yes, he asked,�� whispered Ollivander. ��He wanted to know everything I could tell him about 
the wand variously known as the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny, or the Elder Wand.��

 Harry glanced sideways at Hermione. She looked flabbergasted. 

��The Dark Lord,�� said Ollivander in hushed and frightened tones, ��had always been happy with 
the wand I made him �C yew and phoenix feather, thirteen-and-a-half inches �C until he discovered 
the connection of the twin cores. Now he seeks another, more powerful wand, as the only way to 
conquer yours.�� 

��But he��ll know soon, if he doesn��t already, that mine��s broken beyond repair,�� said Harry 
quietly.

 ��No!�� said Hermione, sounding frightened. ��He can��t know that, Harry, how could he -?��

��357ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Priori Incantatem,�� said Harry. ��We left your wand and the blackthorn wand at the Malfoys��, 
Hermione. If they examine them properly, make them re-create the spells they��ve cast lately, 
they��d see that yours broke mine, they��ll see that you tried and failed to mend it, and they��ll realize 
that I��ve been using the blackthorn one ever since.�� 

The little color she had regained since their arrival had drained from her face. Ron gave Harry a 

reproachful look, and said, ��Let��s not worry about that now -�� 

But Mr. Ollivander intervened. 

��The Dark Lord no longer seeks the Elder Wand only for your destruction, Mr. Potter. He is 

determined to possess it because he believes it will make him truly invulnerable.��

 ��And will it?�� 

��The owner of the Elder Wand must always fear attack,�� said Ollivander, ��but the idea of the 

Dark Lord in possession of the Deathstick is, I must admit ... formidable.�� 

Harry was suddenly reminded of how he had been unsure, when they first met, of how much he 
liked Ollivander. Even now, having been tortured and imprisoned by Voldemort, the idea of the 
Dark Wizard in possession of this wand seemed to enthrall him as much as it repulsed him.

 ��You �C you really think this wand exists, then, Mr. Ollivander?�� asked Hermione. 

��Oh yes,�� said Ollivander. ��Yes, it is perfectly possible to trace the wand��s course through 
history. There are gaps, of course, and long ones, where it vanishes from view, temporarily lost or 
hidden; but always it resurfaces. It has certain identifying characteristics that those who are learned 
in wandlore recognize. There are written accounts, some of them obscure, that I and other 
wandmakers have made it our business to study. They have the ring of authenticity.��

 ��So you �C you don��t think it can be a fairy tale or a myth?�� Hermione asked hopefully. 

��No,�� said Ollivander. ��Whether it needs to pass by murder, I do not know. Its history is 
bloody, but that may be simply due to the fact that it is such a desirable object, and arouses such 
passions in wizards. Immensely powerful, dangerous in the wrong hands, and an object of 
incredible fascination to all of us who study the power of wands.�� 

��Mr. Ollivander,�� said Harry, ��you told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the Elder 
Wand, didn��t you?�� 

Ollivander turned, if possible, even paler. He looked ghostly as he gulped. ��But how �C how do 
you - ?��

��358ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Never mind how I know it,�� said Harry, closing his eyes momentarily as his scar burned and 
he saw, for mere seconds, a vision of the main street in Hogsmeade, still dark, because it was so 
much farther north. ��You told You-Know-Who that Gregorovitch had the wand?�� 

��It was a rumor,�� whispered Ollivander. ��A rumor, years and years ago long before you were 
born, I believe Gregorovitch himself started it. You can see how good it would be for business; 
that he was studying and duplicating the qualities of the Elder Wand!�� 

��Yes, I can see that,�� said Harry. He stood up. ��Mr. Ollivander, one last thing, and then we��ll 

let you get some rest. What do you know about the Deathly Hallows?��

 ��The �C the what?�� asked the wandmaker, looking utterly bewildered.

 ��The Deathly Hallows.��

 ��I��m afraid I don��t know what you��re talking about. Is this still something to do with wands?�� 

Harry looked into the sunken face and believed that Ollivander was not acting. He did not know 

about the Hallows. 

 ��Thank you,�� said Harry. ��Thank you very much. We��ll leave you to get some rest now.�� 

Ollivander looked stricken. ��He was torturing me!�� he gasped. ��The Cruciatus Curse ... you 

have no idea ...��

 ��I do,�� said Harry, ��I really do. Please get some rest. Thank you for telling me all of this.�� 

He led Ron and Hermione down the staircase. Harry caught glimpses of Bill, Fleur, Luna, and 
Dean sitting at the table in the kitchen, cups of tea in front of them. They all looked up at Harry as 
he appeared in the doorway, but he merely nodded to them and continued into the garden, Ron and 
Hermione behind him. The reddish mound of earth that covered Dobby lay ahead, and Harry 
walked back to it, as the pain in his head built more and more powerfully. It was a huge effort now 
to close down the visions that were forcing themselves upon him, but he knew that he would have 
to resist only a little longer. He would yield very soon, because he needed to know that his theory 
was right. He must make only one more short effort, so that he could explain to Ron and 
Hermione. 

��Gregorovitch had the Elder Wand a long time ago,�� he said, ��I saw You-Know-Who trying to 
find him. When he tracked him down, he found that Gregorovitch didn��t have it anymore. It was 
stolen from him by Grindelwald. How Grindelwald found out that Gregorovitch had it, I don��t 
know �C but if Gregorovitch was stupid enough to spread the rumor, it can��t have been that

��359ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

difficult.�� 

Voldemort was at the gates of Hogwarts. Harry could see him standing there, and see too the 
lamp bobbing in the pre-dawn, coming closer and closer. 

��And Grindelwald used the Elder Wand to become powerful. And at the height of his power, 
when Dumbledore knew he was the only one who could stop him, he dueled Grindelwald and beat 
him, and he took the Elder Wand.��

 ��Dumbledore had the Elder Wand?�� said Ron. ��But then �C where is it now?�� 

��At Hogwarts,�� said Harry, fighting to remain with them in the cliff-top garden.

 ��But then, let��s go!�� said Ron urgently. ��Harry, let��s go and get it before he does!�� 

��It��s too late for that,�� said Harry. He could not help himself, but clutched his head, trying to 
help it resist. ��He knows where it is. He��s there now.�� 

��Harry!�� Ron said furiously. ��How long have you known this �C why have we been wasting 
time? Why did you talk to Griphook first? We could have gone �C we could still go �C�� 

��No,�� said Harry, and he sank to his knees in the grass. ��Hermione��s right. Dumbledore didn��t 
want me to have it. He didn��t want me to take it. He wanted me to get the Horcruxes.��

 ��The unbeatable wand, Harry!�� moaned Ron. 

 ��I��m not supposed to ... I��m supposed to get the Horcruxes... �� 

And now everything was cool and dark. The sun was barely visible over the horizon as he 

glided alongside Snape, up through the grounds toward the lake.

 ��I shall join you in the castle shortly,�� he said in his high, cold voice. ��Leave me now.�� 

Snape bowed and set off back up the path, his black cloak billowing behind him. Harry walked 
slowly, waiting for Snape��s figure to disappear. It would not do for Snape, or indeed anyone else, 
to see where he was going. But there were no lights in the castle windows, and he could conceal 
himself ... and in a second he had cast upon himself a Disillusionment Charm that hid him even 
from his own eyes. 

And he walked on, around the edge of the lake, taking in the outlines of the beloved castle, his 
first kingdom, his birthright ... 

And here it was, beside the lake, reflected in the dark waters. The white marble tomb, an 
unnecessary blot on the familiar landscape. He felt again that rush of controlled euphoria, that 
heady sense of purpose in destruction. He raised the old yew wand. How fitting that this would be

��360ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

its last great act. 

The tomb split open from head to foot. The shrouded figure was as long as thin as it had been in 
life. He raised the wand again. 

The wrappings fell open. The face was translucent (��͸����), pale, sunken, yet almost 
perfectly preserved. They had left his spectacles on the crooked nose, He felt amused derision. 
Dumbledore��s hands were folded upon his chest, and there it lay, clutched beneath them, buried 
with him. 

Had the old fool imagined that marble or death would protect the wand? Had he thought that 
the Dark Lord would be scared to violate his tomb? The spiderlike hand swooped and pulled the 
wand from Dumbledore��s grasp, and as he took it, a shower of sparks flew from its tip, sparkling 
over the corpse of its last owner, ready to serve a new master at last.

Chapter Twenty-Five 
Shell Cottage 


Bill and Fleur's cottage stood alone on a cliff 


overlooking 
the sea, its walls embedded with shells and 

whitewashed. 
It was a lonely and beautiful place. Wherever Harry 

went inside the 
tiny cottage or its garden, he could hear the constant 

ebb and flow 
of the sea, like the breathing of some great, 

slumbering 
creature. He spent much of the next few days 

making 
excuses to escape the crowded cottage, craving the cliff-top view of open sky and wide, empty sea, 
and the feel of cold, salty wind on his face. 

The enormity of his decision not to race Voldemort to the wand still scared Harry. He could not 
remember, ever before, choosing not to act. He was full of doubts, doubts that Ron could not help 
voicing whenever they were together. 

"What if Dumbledore wanted us to work out the symbol in time to get the wand?" 

"What if working out what the symbol meant made you 'worthy' to get the Hallows?" 

"Harry, if that really is the Elder Wand, how the hell are we supposed to finish off You-Know-
Who?" 

Harry had no answers. There were moments when he wondered whether it had been outright 
madness not to try to prevent Voldemort breaking open the tomb. He could not even explain 
satisfactorily why he had decided against it. Every time he tried to reconstruct the internal 
arguments that had led to his decision, they sounded feebler to him. 

The odd thing was that Hermione's support made him feel just as confused as Ron's doubts. 

Now forced to accept that the Elder Wand was real, she maintained that it was an evil object, 
and that the way Voldemort had taken possession of it was repellent, not to be considered. 

"You could never have done that, Harry," she said again and again. "You couldn't have broken 
into Dumbledore's grave." 

But the idea of Dumbledore's corpse frightened Harry much less than the possibility that he 
might have misunderstood the living Dumbledore's intentions. He felt that he was still groping in 
the dark; he had chosen his path but kept looking back, wondering whether he had misread the

��362ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

signs, whether he should not have taken the other way. From time to time, anger at Dumbledore 
crashed over him again, powerful as the waves slamming themselves against the cliff beneath the 
cottage, anger that Dumbledore had not explained before he died. 

"But is he dead?" said Ron, three days after they had arrived at the cottage. Harry had been 
staring out over the wall that separated the cottage garden from the cliff when Ron and Hermione 
had found him; he wished they had not, having no wish to join in with their argument. 

"Yes, he is. Ron, please don't start that again!" 

"Look at the facts, Hermione," said Ron, speaking across Harry, who continued to gaze at the 
horizon. "The silver doe. The sword. The eye Harry saw in the mirror -" 

"Harry admits he could have imagined the eye! Don't you, Harry?" 

"I could have," said Harry without looking at her. 

"But you don't think you did, do you?" asked Ron. 

"No, I don't," said Harry. 

"There you go!" said Ron quickly, before Hermione could carry on. "If it wasn't Dumbledore, 
explain how Dobby knew we were in the cellar, Hermione?" 

"I can't -but can you explain how Dumbledore sent him to us if he's lying in a tomb at 
Hogwarts?" 

"I dunno, it could've been his ghost!" 

"Dumbledore wouldn't come back as a ghost," said Harry. There was little about Dumbledore he 
was sure of now, but he knew that much. "He would have gone on." 

"What d'you mean, 'gone on'?" asked Ron, but before Harry could say any more, a voice behind 
them said, "'Arry?" 

Fleur had come out of the cottage, her long silver hair flying in the breeze. 

"'Arry, Grip'ook would like to speak to you. 'E eez in ze smallest bedroom, 'e says 'e does not 
want to be over'eard." 

Her dislike of the goblin sending her to deliver messages was clear; she looked irritable as she 
walked back around the house. 

Griphook was waiting for them, as Fleur had said, in the tiniest of the cottage's three bedrooms, 
in which Hermione and Luna slept by night. He had drawn the red cotton curtains against the 
bright, cloudy sky, which gave the room a fiery glow at odds with the rest of the airy, light cottage.

��363ҳ��

"I have reached my decision, Harry Potter," said the goblin, who was sitting cross-legged in a 
low chair, drumming its arms with his spindly fingers. "Though the goblins of Gringotts will 
consider it base treachery, I have decided to help you -" 

"That's great!" said Harry, relief surging through him. "Griphook, thank you, we're really -" 

"- in return," said the goblin firmly, "for payment." 

Slightly taken aback, Harry hesitated. "How much do you want? I've got gold." 

"Not gold," said Griphook. "I have gold." 

His black eyes glittered; there were no whites to his eyes. 

"I want the sword. The sword of Godric Gryffindor." 

Harry's spirits plummeted. "You can't have that," he said. "I'm sorry." 

"Then," said the goblin softly, "we have a problem." 

"We can give you something else," said Ron eagerly. "I'll bet the Lestranges have got loads of 
stuff, you can take your pick once we get into the vault." 

He had said the wrong thing. Griphook flushed angrily. 

"I am not a thief, boy! I am not trying to procure treasures to which I have no right!" 

"The sword's ours -" 

"It is not," said the goblin. 

"We're Gryffindors, and it was Godric Gryffindor's -" 

"And before it was Gryffindor's, whose was it?" demanded the goblin, sitting up straight. 

"No one's," said Ron. "It was made for him, wasn't it?" 

"No!" cried the goblin, bristling with anger as he pointed a long finger at Ron. "Wizarding 
arrogance again! That sword was Ragnuk the First's, taken from him by Godric Gryffindor! It is a 
lost treasure, a masterpiece of goblinwork! It belongs with the goblins. The sword is the price of 
my hire, take it or leave it!" 

Griphook glared at them. Harry glanced at the other two, then said, "We need to discuss this, 

Griphook, if that's all right. Could you give us a few minutes?" 

The goblin nodded, looking sour. 

Downstairs in the empty sitting room, Harry walked to the fireplace, brow furrowed, trying to 
think what to do. Behind him, Ron said, "He's having a laugh. We can't let him have that sword." 

"It is true?" Harry asked Hermione. "Was the sword stolen by Gryffindor?"

��364ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I don't know," she said hopelessly. "Wizarding history often skates over (go over quickly) what 
the wizards have done to other magical races, but there's no account that I know of that says 
Gryffindor stole the sword." 

"It'll be one of those goblin stories," said Ron, "about how the wizards are always trying to get 
one over on them. I suppose we should think ourselves lucky he hasn't asked for one of our 
wands." 

"Goblins have got good reason to dislike wizards, Ron." said Hermione. "They've been treated 
brutally in the past." 

"Goblins aren't exactly fluffy little bunnies, though, are they?" said Ron. "They've killed plenty 
of us. They've fought dirty too." 

"But arguing with Griphook about whose race is most underhanded���ӵ� and violent isn't 
going to make him more likely to help us, is it?" 

There was a pause while they tried to think of a way around the problem. Harry looked out of 
the window at Dobby's grave. Luna was arranging sea lavender in a jam jar beside the headstone. 

"Okay," said Ron, and Harry turned back to face him, "how's this? We tell Griphook we need 
the sword until we get inside the vault and then he can have it. There's a fake in these, isn't there? 
We switch them, and give him the fake." 

"Ron, he'd know the difference better than we would!" said Hermione. "He's the only one who 
realized there had been a swap!" 

"Yeah, but we could scarper (British Slang)��� 
escape without paying a debt) before he 
realizes -" 

He quailed beneath the look Hermione was giving him. 

"That," she said quietly, "is despicable. Ask for his help, then double-cross him? And you 
wonder why goblins don't like wizards, Ron?" 

Ron's ears had turned red. "All right, all right! It was the only thing I could think of! What's your 
solution, then?" 

"We need to offer him something else, something just as valuable." 

"Brilliant, I'll go and get one of our ancient goblin-made swords and you can gift wrap�ð�װ
ֽ��װ it." 

Silence fell between them again. Harry was sure that the goblin would accept nothing but the

��365ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sword, even if they had something as valuable to offer him. Yet the sword was their one 
indispensable weapon against the Horcruxes. 

He closed his eyes for a moment or two and listened to the rush of the sea. The idea that 
Gryffindor might have stolen the sword was unpleasant to him. He had always been proud to be a 
Gryffindor. Gryffindor had been the champion of Muggle-borns, the wizard who had clashed with 
the pureblood-loving Slytherin. 

"Maybe he's lying," Harry said, opening his eyes again. "Griphook. Maybe Gryffindor didn't 

take the sword. How do we know the goblin version of history's right?" 

"Does it make a difference?" asked Hermione. 

"Changes how I feel about it," said Harry. 

He took a deep breath. 

"We'll tell him he can have the sword after he's helped us get into that vault - but we'll be careful 

to avoid telling him exactly when he can have it." 

A grin spread slowly across Ron's face. Hermione, however, looked alarmed. 

"Harry, we can't -" 

"He can have it," Harry went on, "after we've used it on all of the Horcruxes. I'll make sure he 

gets it then. I'll keep my word." 

"But that could be years!" said Hermione. 

"I know that, but he needn't. I won't be lying... really." 

Harry met her eyes with a mixture of defiance and shame. He remembered the words that had 

been engraved over the gateway to Nurmengard, FOR THE GREATER GOOD. He pushed the 

idea away. What choice did they have? 

"I don't like it," said Hermione. 

"Nor do I, much," Harry admitted. 

"Well, I think it's genius," said Ron, standing up again. "Let's go and tell him." 

Back in the smallest bedroom, Harry made the offer, careful to phrase it so as not to give any 
definite time for the handover of the sword. Hermione frowned at the floor while he was speaking; 
he felt irritated at her, afraid that she might give the game away. However, Griphook had eyes for 
nobody but Harry. 

"I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the sword of Gryffindor if I help you?"

"Yes," said Harry. 

"Then shake," said the goblin, holding out his hand. 

Harry took it and shook. He wondered whether those black eyes saw any misgivings in his own. 
Then Griphook relinquished him, clapped his hands together, and said, "So. We begin!" 

It was like planning to break into the Ministry all over again. They settled to work in the 
smallest bedroom, which was kept, according to Griphook's preference, in semidarkness. 

"I have visited the Lestranges' vault only once," Griphook told them, "on the occasion I was told 
to place inside it the false sword. It is one of the most ancient chambers. The oldest Wizarding 
families store their treasures at the deepest level, where the vaults are largest and best protected." 

They remained shut in the cupboard-like room for hours at a time. Slowly the days stretched 
into weeks. There was problem after problem to overcome, not least of which was that their store 
of Polyjuice Potion was greatly depleted. 

"There's really only enough left for one of us," said Hermione, tilting the thick mudlike potion 
against the lamplight. 

"That'll be enough," said Harry, who was examining Griphook's hand-drawn map of the deepest 
passageways. 

The other inhabitants of Shell Cottage could hardly fail to notice that something was going on 
now that Harry, Ron and Hermione only emerged for mealtimes. Nobody asked questions, 
although Harry often felt Bill's eyes on the three of them at the table, thoughtful, concerned. 

The longer they spent together, the more Harry realized that he did not much like the goblin. 
Griphook was unexpectedly bloodthirsty, laughed at the idea of pain in lesser creatures and seemed 
to relish the possibility that they might have to hurt other wizards to reach the Lestranges' vault. 
Harry could tell that his distaste was shared by the other two, but they did not discuss it. They 
needed Griphook. 

The goblin ate only grudgingly with the rest of them. Even after his legs had mended, he 
continued to request trays of food in his room, like the still-frail Ollivander, until Bill (following 
an angry outburst from Fleur) went upstairs to tell him that the arrangement could not continue. 
Thereafter Griphook joined them at the overcrowded table, although he refused to eat the same 
food, insisting, instead, on lumps of raw meat, roots, and various fungi. 

Harry felt responsible. It was, after all, he who had insisted that the goblin remain at Shell

��367ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cottage so that he could question him; his fault that the whole Weasley family had been driven 
into hiding, that Bill, Fred, George, and Mr. Weasley could no longer work. 

"I'm sorry," he told Fleur, one blustery (stormy) April evening as he helped her prepare dinner. 
"I never meant you to have to deal with all of this." 

She had just set some knives to work, chipping up steaks for Griphook and Bill, who had 
preferred his meat bloody ever since he had been attacked by Greyback. While the knives sliced 
behind her, her somewhat irritable expression softened. 

"'Arry, you saved my sister's life, I do not forget." 

This was not, strictly speaking, true, but Harry decided against reminding her that Gabrielle had 
never been in real danger. 

"Anyway," Fleur went on, pointing her want at a pot of sauce on the stove, which began to 
bubble at once, "Mr. Ollivander leaves for Muriel's zis evening. Zat will make zings easier. Ze 
goblin," she scowled a little at the mention of him, "can move downstairs, and you, Ron, and Dean 
can take zat room." 

"We don't mind sleeping in the living room," said Harry, who knew that Griphook would think 
poorly of having to sleep on the sofa; keeping Griphook happy was essential to their plans. "Don't 
worry about us." And when she tried to protest he went on, "We'll be off your hands soon too, Ron, 
Hermione, and I. We won't need to be here much longer." 

"But, what do you mean?" she said, frowning at him, her wand pointing at the casserole dish 
now suspended in midair. "Of course you must not leave, you are safe 'ere!" 

She looked rather like Mrs. Weasley as she said it, and he was glad that the back door opened at 
that moment. Luna and Dean entered, their hair damp from the rain outside and their arms full of 
driftwood. 

"... and tiny little ears," Luna was saying, "a bit like hippo's, Daddy says, only purple and hairy. 
And if you want to call them, you have to hum; they prefer a waltz, nothing too fast." 

Looking uncomfortable, Dean shrugged at Harry as he passed, following Luna into the 
combined dining and sitting room where Ron and Hermione were laying the dinner table. Seizing 
the chance to escape Fleur's questions, Harry grabbed two jugs of pumpkin juice and followed 
them. 

"... and if you ever come to our house I'll be able to show you the horn. Daddy wrote to me

��368ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

about it but I haven't seen it yet, because the Death Eaters took me from the Hogwarts Express and 
I never got home for Christmas," Luna was saying, as she and Dean relit the fire. 

"Luna, we told you," Hermione called over to her. "That horn exploded. It came from an 
Erumpent, not a Crumple-Horned Snorkack -" 

"No, it was definitely a Snorkack horn," said Luna serenely, "Daddy told me. It will probably 
have re-formed by now, they mend themselves, you know." 

Hermione shook her head and continued laying down forks as Bill appeared, leading Mr. 
Ollivander down the stairs. The wandmaker still looked exceptionally frail, and he clung to Bill's 
arm as the latter supported him, carrying a large suitcase. 

"I'm going to miss you, Mr. Ollivander," said Luna, approaching the old man. 

"And I you, my dear," said Ollivander, patting her on the shoulder. "You were an inexpressible 
comfort to me in that terrible place." 

"So, au revoir, Mr. Ollivander," said Fleur, kissing him on both cheeks. "And I wonder whezzer 
you could oblige me by delivering a package to Bill's Auntie Murie!? I never returned 'er tiara." 

"It will be an honor," said Ollivander with a little bow, "the very least I can do in return for your 
generous hospitality." 

Fleur drew out a worn velvet case, which she opened to show the wandmaker. The tiara sat 
glittering and twinkling in the light from the low-hanging lamp. 

"Moonstones and diamonds," said Griphook, who had sidled into the room without Harry 
noticing. "Made by goblins, I think?" 

"And paid for by wizards," said Bill quietly, and the goblin shot him a look that was both furtive 
and challenging. 

A strong wind gusted against the cottage windows as Bill and Ollivander set off into the night. 
The rest of them squeezed in around the table; elbow to elbow and with barely enough room to 
move, they started to eat. The fire crackled and popped in the grate beside them. Fleur, Harry 
noticed, was merely playing with her food; she glanced at the window every few minutes; 
however, Bill returned before they had finished their first course, his long hair tangled by the wind. 

"Everything's fine," he told Fleur. "Ollivander settled in, Mum and Dad say hello. Ginny sends 
you all her love, Fred and George are driving Muriel up the wall, they're still operating an Owl-
Order business out of her back room. It cheered her up to have her tiara back, though. She said she

��369ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

thought we'd stolen it." 

"Ah, she eez charmant, your aunt," said Fleur crossly, waving her wand and causing the dirty 
plates to rise and form a stack in midair. She caught them and marched out of the room. 

"Daddy's made a tiara," piped up Luna, "Well, more of a crown, really." 

Ron caught Harry's eye and grinned; Harry knew that he was remembering the ludicrous 
headdress they had seen on their visit to Xenophilius. 

"Yes, he's trying to re-create the lost diadem of Ravenclaw. He thinks he's identified most of the 
main elements now. Adding the billywig wings really made a difference -" 

There was a bang on the front door. Everyone's head turned toward it. Fleur came running out of 
the kitchen, looking frightened; Bill jumped to his feed, his wand pointing at the door; Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione did the same. Silently Griphook slipped beneath the table, out of sight. 

"Who is it?" Bill called. 

"It is I, Remus John Lupin!" called a voice over the howling wind. 

Harry experienced a thrill of fear; what had happened? 

"I am a werewolf, married to Nymphadora Tonks, and you, the Secret-Keeper of Shell Cottage, 
told me the address and bade me come in an emergency!" 

"Lupin," muttered Bill, and he ran to the door and wrenched it open. 

Lupin fell over the threshold. He was white-faced, wrapped in a traveling cloak, his graying hair 

windswept. He straightened up, looked around the room, making sure of who was there, then cried 

aloud, "It's a boy! We've named him Ted, after Dora's father!" 

Hermione shrieked. 

"Wha -? Tonks - Tonks has had the baby?" 

"Yes, yes, she's had the baby!" shouted Lupin. 

All around the table came cries of delight, sighs of relief, Hermione and Fleur both squealed, 

"Congratulations!" and Ron said, "Blimey, a baby!" as if he had never heard of such a thing before. 

"Yes -yes -a boy," said Lupin again, who seemed dazed by his own happiness. He strode 
around the table and hugged Harry; the scene in the basement of Grimmauld Place might never 
have happened. 

"You'll be godfather?" he said as he released Harry. 

"M-me?" stammered Harry.

��370ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"You, yes, of course - Dora quite agrees, no one better -" 

"I - yeah - blimey -" 

Harry felt overwhelmed, astonished, delighted; now Bill was hurrying to fetch wine, and Fleur 
was persuading Lupin to join them for a drink. 

"I can't stay long, I must get back," said Lupin, beaming around at them all. He looked years 

younger than Harry had ever seen him. "Thank you, thank you, Bill" 

Bill had soon filled all of their goblets, they stood and raised them high in a toast. 

"To Teddy Remus Lupin," said Lupin, "a great wizard in the making (future)!" 

"'Oo does 'e look like?" Fleur inquired. 

"I think he looks like Dora, but she thinks he is like me. Not much hair. It looked black when he 
was born, but I swear it's turned ginger in the hour since. Probably blond by the time I get back. 
Andromeda says Tonks's hair started changing color the day that she was born." He drained his 
goblet. "Oh, go on then, just one more," he added, beaming, as Bill made to fill it again. 

The wind buffeted the little cottage and the fire leapt and crackled, and Bill was soon opening 
another bottle of wine. Lupin's news seemed to have taken them out of themselves, removed them 
for a while from their state of siege. Tidings of new life were exhilarating. Only the goblin seemed 
untouched by the suddenly festive atmosphere, and after a while he slunk back to the bedroom he 
now occupied alone. Harry thought he was the only one who had noticed this, until he saw Bill's 
eyes following the goblin up the stairs. 

"No... no... I really must get back," said Lupin at last, declining yet another goblet of wine. He 
got to his feet and pulled his traveling cloak back around himself. 

"Good-bye, good-bye -I'll try and bring some pictures in a few day's time -they'll all be so glad 
to know that I've seen you -" 

He fastened his cloak and made his farewells, hugging the women and grasping hands with the 
men, then, still beaming, returned into the wild night. 

"Godfather, Harry!" said Bill as they walked into the kitchen together, helping clear the table. 
"A real honor! Congratulations!" 

As Harry set down the empty goblets he was carrying, Bill pulled the door behind him closed, 
shutting out the still-voluble voices of the others, who were continuing to celebrate even in Lupin's 
absence.

��371ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I wanted a private word, actually, Harry. It hasn't been easy to get an opportunity with the 

cottage this full of people." 

Bill hesitated. "Harry, you're planning something with Griphook." 

It was a statement, not a question, and Harry did not bother to deny it. He merely looked at Bill, 

waiting. 

"I know goblins," said Bill. "I've worked for Gringotts ever since I left Hogwarts. As far as there 
can be friendship between wizards and goblins, I have goblin friends -or, at least, goblins I know 
well, and like." 

Again, Bill hesitated. "Harry, what do you want from Griphook, and what have you promised 

him in return?" 

"I can't tell you that," said Harry. "Sorry, Bill." 

The kitchen door opened behind them; Fleur was trying to bring through more empty goblets. 

"Wait," Bill told her, "Just a moment." 

She backed out and he closed the door again. 

"Then I have to say this," Bill went on. "If you have struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, 
and most particularly if that bargain involves treasure, you must be exceptionally careful. Goblin 
notions of ownership, payment, and repayment are not the same as human ones." 

Harry felt a slight squirm of discomfort, as though a small snake had stirred inside him. "What 
do you mean?" he asked. 

"We are talking about a different breed of being," said Bill. "Dealings between wizards and 
goblins have been fraught for centuries -but you'll know all that from History of Magic. There has 
been fault on both sides, I would never claim that wizards have been innocent. However, there is a 
belief among some goblins, and those at Gringotts are perhaps most prone to it, that wizards 
cannot be trusted in matters of gold and treasure, that they have no respect for goblin ownership." 

"I respect -" Harry began, but Bill shook his head. 

"You don't understand, Harry, nobody could understand unless they have lived with goblins. To 
a goblin, the rightful and true master of any object is the maker, not the purchaser. All goblin made 
objects are, in goblin eyes, rightfully theirs." 

"But it was bought -" 

"-then they would consider it rented by the one who had paid the money. They have, however,

��372ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

great difficulty with the idea of goblin-made objects passing from wizard to wizard. You saw 
Griphook's face when the tiara passed under his eyes. He disapproves. I believe he thinks, as do the 
fiercest of his kind, that it ought to have been returned to the goblins once the original purchaser 
died. They consider our habit of keeping goblin-made objects, passing them from wizard to wizard 
without further payment, little more than theft." 

Harry had an ominous feeling now; he wondered whether Bill guessed more than he was letting 
on. 

"All I am saying," said Bill, setting his hand on the door back into the sitting room, "is to be 
very careful what you promise goblins, Harry. It would be less dangerous to break into Gringotts 
than to renege [r.'n..g]ΥԼ;���� 
on a promise to a goblin." 

"Right," said Harry as Bill opened the door, "yeah. Thanks. I'll bear that in mind." 

As he followed Bill back to the others a wry (ironic) thought came to him, born no doubt of the 
wine he had drunk. He seemed set on course to become just as reckless a godfather to Teddy Lupin 
as Sirius Black had been to him.

Chapter Twenty-Six 



Gringotts 

Their plans were made, their preparations complete; in 


the smallest 
bedroom a single long, coarse black hair (plucked from 

the sweater 
Hermione had been wearing at Malfoy Manor) lay curled 

in a small 
glass phial on the mantelpiece. 
"And you'll be using her actual wand," said Harry, nodding toward the walnut wand, "so I 

reckon you'll be pretty convincing."

 Hermione looked frightened that the wand might sting or bit her as she picked it up. 

"I hate that thing," she said in a low voice. "I really hate it. It feels all wrong, it doesn't work 

properly for me ... It's like a bit of her." 

Harry could not help but remember how Hermione has dismissed his loathing of the blackthorn 
wand, insisting that he was imagining things when it did not work as well as his own, telling him 
to simply practice. He chose not to repeat her own advice back to her, however, the eve of their 
attempted assault on Gringotts felt like the wrong moment to antagonize her.

 "It'll probably help you get in character, though," said Ron. "think what that wand's done!" 

"But that's my point!" said Hermione. "This is the wand that tortured Neville's mum and dad, 
and who knows how many other people? This is the wand that killed Sirius!" 

Harry had not thought of that. He looked down at the wand and was visited by a brutal urge to 
snap it, to slice it in half with Gryffindor's sword, which was propped against the wall beside him. 

"I miss my wand," Hermione said miserably. "I wish Mr. Ollivander could have made me 
another one too." 

Mr. Ollivander had sent Luna a new wand that morning. She was out on the back lawn at that 
moment, testing its capabilities in the late afternoon sun. Dean, who had lost his wand to the 
Snatchers, was watching rather gloomily. 

Harry looked down at the hawthorn wand that had once belonged to Draco Malfoy. He had been 
surprised, but pleased to discover that it worked for him at least as well as Hermione's had done. 
Remembering what Ollivander had told them of the secret workings of wands, Harry thought he 
knew what Hermione's problem was. She had not won the walnut wand's allegiance by taking it

��374ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

personally from Bellatrix. 

The door of the bedroom opened and Griphook entered. Harry reached instinctively for the hilt 
of the sword and drew it close to him, but regretted his action at once. He could tell that the goblin 
had noticed. 

Seeking to gloss over the sticky moment, he said, "We've just been checking the last-minute 
stuff, Griphook. We've told Bill and Fleur we're leaving tomorrow, and we've told them not to get 
up to see us off." 

They had been firm on this point, because Hermione would need to transform in Bellatrix 
before they left, and the less that Bill and Fleur knew or suspected about what they were about to 
do, the better. They had also explained that they would not be returning. As they had lost Perkin's 
old tent on the night that the Snatcher's caught them, Bill had lent them another one. It was now 
packed inside the beaded bag, which, Harry was impressed to learn, Hermione had protected from 
the Snatchers by the simple expedient (Ӧ���취��Ȩ���ֶ�) of stuffing it down her sock. 

Though he would miss Bill, Fleur, Luna, and Dean, not to mention the home comforts they had 
enjoyed over the last few weeks, Harry was looking forward to escaping the confinement of Shell 
Cottage. He was tired of trying to make sure that they were not overheard, tired of being shut in the 
tiny, dark bedroom. Most of all, he longed to be rid of Griphook. However, precisely how and 
when they were to part from the goblin without handing over Gryffindor's sword remained a 
question to which Harry had no answer. It had been impossible to decide how they were going to 
do it, because the goblin rarely left Harry, Ron, and Hermione alone together for more than five 
minutes at a time. 

"He could give my mother lessons," growled Ron, as the goblin's long fingers kept appearing 
around the edges of doors. 

With Bill's warning in mind, Harry could not help suspecting that Griphook was on the watch 
for possible skullduggery. 

Hermione disapproved so heartily of the planned double-cross that Harry had given up 
attempting to pick her brains on how best to do it, Ron, on the rare occasions that they had been 
able to snatch a few Griphook-free moments, had come up with nothing better than "We'll just 
have to wing it����ʱ׼��/�ճɣ�, mate." 

Harry slept badly that night. Lying away in the early hours, he thought back to the way he had

��375ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

felt the night before they had infiltrated the Ministry of Magic and remembered a determination, 
almost an excitement. Now he was experiencing jolts of anxiety, nagging doubts. He could not 
shake off the fear that it was all going to go wrong. He kept telling himself that their plan was 
good, that Griphook knew what they were facing, that they were well-prepared for all the 
difficulties they were likely to encounter, yet still he felt uneasy. Once or twice he heard Ron stir 
and was sure that he too was awake, but they were sharing the sitting room with Dean, so Harry 
did not speak. 

It was a relief when six o��clock arrived and they could slip out of their sleeping bags, dress in 
the semidarkness, then creep out into the garden, where they were to meet Hermione and 
Griphook. The dawn was chilly, but there was little wind now that it was May. Harry looked up at 
the stars still glimmering palely in the dark sky and listened to the sea washing backward and 
forward against the cliff. He was going to miss the sound. 

Small green shoots were forcing their way up through the red earth of Dobby's grave now, in a 
year's time the mound would be covered in flowers. The white stone that bore the elf's name had 
already acquired a weathered look. He realized now that they could hardly have laid Dobby to rest 
in a more beautiful place, but Harry ached with sadness to think of leaving him behind. Looking 
down on the grave, he wondered yet again how the elf had known where to come to rescue them. 
His fingers moved absentmindedly to the little pouch still strung around his neck, through which 
he could feel the jagged mirror fragment in which he had been sure he had seen Dumbledore's eye. 
Then the sound of a door opening made him look around. 

Bellatrix Lestrange was striding across the lawn toward them, accompanied by Griphook. As 
she walked, she was tucking the small, beaded bag into the inside pocket of another set of the old 
robes they had taken from Grimmauld Place. Though Harry knew perfectly well that it was really 
Hermione, he could not suppress a shiver of loathing. She was taller than he was, her long black 
hair rippling down her back, her heavily lidded eyes disdainful as they rested upon him; but then 
she spoke, and he heard Hermione through Bellatrix's low voice.

 "She tasted disgusting, worse than Gurdyroots! Okay, Ron, come here so I can do you ...��

 "Right, but remember, I don't like the beard too long." 

 "Oh, for heaven's sake, this isn't about looking handsome." 

"It's not that, it gets in the way! But I liked my nose a bit shorter, try and do it the way you did

��376ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

last time." 

Hermione sighed and set to work, muttering under her breath as she transformed various 
aspects of Ron's appearance. He was to be given a completely fake identity, and they were trusting 
to the malevolent aura cast by Bellatrix to protect him. Meanwhile Harry and Griphook were to be 
concealed under the Invisibility Cloak.

 "There," said Hermione, "how does he look, Harry?" 

It was just possible to discern Ron under his disguise, but only, Harry thought, because he knew 
him so well. Ron's hair was now long and wavy; he had a thick brown beard and mustache, no 
freckles, a short, broad nose, and heavy eyebrows.

 "Well, he's not my type��������ϲ�������ͣ�, but he'll do," said Harry. "Shall we go, then?" 

All three of them glanced back at Shell Cottage, lying dark and silent under the fading stars, 
then turned and began to walk toward the point, just beyond the boundary wall, where the Fidelius 
Chard stopped working and they would be able to Disapparate. Once past the gate, Griphook 
spoke. 

 "I should climb up now, Harry Potter, I think?" 

Harry bent down and the goblin clambered onto his back, his hands linked on front of Harry's 
throat. He was not heavy, but Harry disliked the feeling of the goblin and the surprising strength 
with which he clung on. Hermione pulled the Invisibility Cloak out of the beaded bag and threw it 
over them both.

 "Perfect," she said, bending down to check Harry's feet. "I can't see a thing. Let's go." 

Harry turned on the spot, with Griphook on his shoulders, concentrating with all his might on 
the Leaky Cauldron, the inn that was the entrance to Diagon Alley. The goblin clung even tighter 
as they moved into the compressing darkness, and seconds later Harry's feet found pavement and 
he opened his eyes on Charing Cross Road. Muggles bustled past wearing the hangdog expressions 
of early morning, quite unconscious of the little inn's existence. 

The bar of the Leaky Cauldron was nearly deserted. Tom, the stooped and toothless landlord, 
was polishing glasses behind the bar counter; a couple of warlocks having a muttered conversation 
in the far corner glanced at Hermione and drew back into the shadows. 

"Madam Lestrange," murmured Tom, and as Hermione paused he inclined his head 
subserviently.

��377ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Good morning," said Hermione, and as Harry crept past, still carrying Griphook piggyback��
��/����under the Cloak, he saw Tom look surprised. 

"Too polite," Harry whispered in Hermione's ear as they passed out of the Inn into the tiny 
backyard. "You need to treat people like they're scum!"

 "Okay, okay!" 

Hermione drew out Bellatrix's wand and rapped a brick in the nondescript wall in front of them. 
At once the bricks began to whirl and spin, A hole appeared in the middle of them, which grew 
wider and wider, finally forming an archway onto the narrow cobbled street that was Diagon 
Alley. 

It was quiet, barely time for the shops to open, and there were hardly any shoppers abroad 
(outside, out of doors). The crooked, cobbled street was much altered now from the bustling place 
Harry had visited before his first term at Hogwarts so many years before. More shops than ever 
were boarded up, though several new establishments dedicated to the Dark Arts had been created 
since his last visit. Harry's own face glared down at him from posters plastered over many 
windows, always captioned with the words UNDESIRABLE NUMBER ONE. 

A number of ragged people sat huddled in doorways. He heard them moaning to the few 
passersby, pleading for gold, insisting that they were really wizards. One man had a bloody 
bandage over his eye. 

As they set off along the street, the beggars glimpsed Hermione. They seemed to melt away 
before her, drawing hoods over their faces and fleeing as fast as they could. Hermione looked after 
them curiously, until the man with the bloodied bandage came staggering right across her path. 

"My children," he bellowed, pointing at her. His voice was cracked, high-pitched, he sounded 

distraught. "Where are my children? What has he done with them? You know, you know!" 

 "I -I really -" stammered Hermione. 

The man lunged at her, reaching for her throat. Then, with a bang and a burst of red light he 
was thrown backward onto the ground, unconscious. Ron stood there, his wand still outstretched 
and a look of shock visible behind his beard. Faces appeared at the windows on either side of the 
street, while a little knot of prosperous-looking passersby gathered their robes about them and 
broke into gentle trots, keen to vacate the scene. 

Their entrance into Diagon Alley could hardly have been more conspicuous; for a moment

��378ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry wondered whether it might not be better to leave now and try to think of a different plan. 

Before they could move or consult one another, however, they heard a cry from behind them.

 "Why, Madam Lestrange!" 

Harry whirled around and Griphook tightened his hold around Harry's neck. A tall, thin wizard 

with a crown of bushy gray hair and a long, sharp nose was striding toward them. 

"It's Travers," hissed the goblin into Harry's ear, but at that moment Harry could not think who 
Travers was. Hermione had drawn herself up to full height and said with as much contempt as she 
could muster,

 "And what do you want?" 

 Travers stopped in his tracks, clearly affronted. 

"He's another Death Eater!" breathed Griphook, and Harry sidled sideways to repeat the 
information into Hermione's ear. 

 "I merely sought to greet you," said Travers coolly, "but if my presence is not welcome ...�� 

Harry recognized his voice now. Travers was one of the Death Eaters who had been summoned 
to Xenophilius��s house. 

"No, no, not at all, Travers," said Hermione quickly, trying to cover up her mistake. "How are 
you?"

 "Well, I confess I am surprised to see you out and about, Bellatrix."

 "Really? Why?" asked Hermione. 

"Well," Travers coughed, "I heard that the Inhabitants of Malfoy Manor were confined to the 
house, after the ... ah ... escape." 

Harry willed Hermione to keep her head. If this was true, and Bellatrix was not supposed to be 
out in public - 

"The Dark Lord forgives those who have served him most faithfully in the past," said Hermione 
in a magnificent imitation of Bellatrix's most contemptuous manner. "Perhaps your credit is not as 
good with him as mine is, Travers." 

Though the Death Eater looked offended, he also seemed less suspicious. He glanced down at 

the man Ron had just Stunned. 

 "How did it offend you?"

 "It does not matter, it will not do so again," said Hermione coolly.

"Some of these wandless can be troublesome," said Travers. "While they do nothing but beg I 
have no objection, but one of them actually asked me to plead her case in the Ministry last week. 
'I'm a witch, sir, I'm a witch, let me prove it to you!" he said in a squeaky impersonation. "As if I 
was going to give her my wand -but whose wand," said Travers curiously, "are you using at the 
moment, Bellatrix? I heard that your own was -" 

"I have my wand here," said Hermione coldly, holding up Bellatrix's wand. "I don't know what 

rumors you have been listening to, Travers, but you seem sadly misinformed."

 Travers seemed a little taken aback at that, and he turned instead to Ron. 

 "Who is your friend? I do not recognize him." 

"This is Dragomir Despard," said Hermione; they had decided that a fictional foreigner was the 

safest cover for Ron to assume. "He speaks very little English, but he is in sympathy with the Dark 

Lord's aims. He has traveled here from Transylvania to see our new regime."

 "Indeed? How do you do, Dragomir?"

 "'Ow you?" said Ron, holding out his hand. 

 Travers extended two fingers and shook Ron's hand as though frightened of dirtying himself. 

��So what brings you and your-ah-sympathetic friend to Diagon Alley this early?" asked 

Travers.

 "I need to visit Gringotts," said Hermione. 

"Alas, I also," said Travers. "Gold, filthy gold! We cannot live without it, yet I confess I 

deplore the necessity of consorting with our long-fingered friends." 

 Harry felt Griphook's clasped hands tighten momentarily around his neck. 

 "Shall we?" said Travers, gesturing Hermione forward. 

Hermione had no choice but to fall into step beside him and head along the crooked, cobbled 
street toward the place where the snowy-white Gringotts stood towering over the other little shops. 
Ron sloped along beside them, and Harry and Griphook followed. 

A watchful Death Eater was the very last thing they needed, and the worst of it was, with 
Travers matching at what he believed to be Bellatrix's side, there was no means for Harry to 
communicate with Hermione or Ron. All too soon they arrived at the foot of the marble steps 
leading up to the great bronze doors. As Griphook had already warned them, the liveried���Ʒ��� 
goblins who usually flanked the entrance had been replaced by two wizards, both of whom were

��380ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

clutching long thin golden rods. 

 "Ah, Probity Probes," signed Travers theatrically, "so crude but so effective!" 

And he set off up the steps, nodding left and right to the wizards, who raised the golden rods 
and passed them up and down his body. The Probes, Harry knew, detected spells of concealment 
and hidden magical objects. Knowing that he had only seconds, Harry pointed Draco's wand at 
each of the guards in turn and murmured, "Confundo" twice. Unnoticed by Travers, who was 
looking through the bronze doors at the inner hall, each of the guards gave a little start as the spells 
hit them.

 Hermione's long black hair rippled behind her as she climbed the steps. 

 "One moment, madam," said the guard, raising his Probe. 

"But you've just done that!" said Hermione in Bellatrix's commanding, arrogant voice. Travers 
looked around, eyebrows raised. The guard was confused. He stared down at the thin golden Probe 

and then at his companion, who said in a slightly dazed voice,

 "Yeah, you've just checked them, Marius." 

Hermione swept forward. Ron by her side, Harry and Griphook trotting invisibly behind them. 

Harry glanced back as they crossed the threshold. The wizards were both scratching their heads. 

Two goblins stood before the inner doors, which were made of silver and which carried the 
poem warning of dire retribution to potential thieves. Harry looked up at it, and all of a sudden a 
knife-sharp memory came to him, standing on this very spot on the day that he had turned eleven, 
the most wonderful birthday of his life, and Hagrid standing beside him saying, "Like I said, yeh'd 
be mad ter try an' rob it." Gringotts had seemed a place of wonder that day, the enchanted 
repository���� 
;���ش�of a trove (sum of money) of gold he had never known he possessed, and 
never for an instant could he have dreamed that he would return to steal ... But within seconds they 
were standing in the vast marble hall of the bank. 

The long counter was manned by goblins sitting on high stools serving the first customers of 
the day. Hermione, Ron, and Travers headed toward an old goblin who was examining a thick gold 
coin through an eyeglass. Hermione allowed Travers to step ahead of her on the pretext of 
explaining features of the hall to Ron. 

The goblin tossed the coin he was holding aside, said to nobody in particular, "Leprechaun," 
and then greeted Travers, who passed over a tiny golden key, which was examined and given back

��381ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

to him.

 Hermione stepped forward. 

"Madam Lestrange!" said the goblin, evidently startled. "Dear me! How -how may I help you 

today?"

 "I wish to enter my vault," said Hermione. 

The old goblin seemed to recoil a little. Harry glanced around. Not only was Travers hanging 

back, watching, but several other goblins had looked up from their work to stare at Hermione.

 "You have ... identification?" asked the goblin.

 "Identification? I -I have never been asked for identification before!" said Hermione. 

"They know!" whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, "They must have been warned there might be 

an imposter!" 

"Your wand will do, madam," said the goblin. He held out a slightly trembling hand, and in a 
dreadful blast of realization Harry knew that the goblins of Gringotts were aware that Bellatrix's 
wand had been stolen.

 "Act now, act now," whispered Griphook in Harry's ear, "the Imperious Curse!" 

Harry raised the hawthorn wand beneath the cloak, pointed it at the old goblin, and whispered, 
for the first time in his life, "Imperio!" 

A curious sensation shot down Harry's arm, a feeling of tingling, warmth that seemed to flow 
from his mind, down the sinews and veins connecting him to the wand and the curse it had just 
cast. The goblin took Bellatrix's wand, examined it closely, and then said, "Ah, you have had a 
new wand made, Madam Lestrange!"

 "What?" said Hermione, "No, no, that's mine -" 

"A new wand?" said Travers, approaching the counter again; still the goblins all around were 
watching. "But how could you have done, which wandmaker did you use?" 

 Harry acted without thinking. Pointing his wand at Travers, he muttered, "Imperio!" once more. 

"Oh yes, I see," said Travers, looking down at Bellatrix's wand, "yes, very handsome, and is it 
working well? I always think wands require a little breaking inѵ������ 
, don't you?" 

Hermione looked utterly bewildered, but to Harry's enormous relief she accepted the bizarre 
turn of events without comment.

 The old goblin behind the counter clapped his hands and a younger goblin approached.

��382ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I shall need the Clankers," he told the goblin, who dashed away and returned a moment later 
with a leather bag that seemed to be full of jangling metal, which he handed to his senior. "Good, 
good! So, if you will follow me, Madam Lestrange," said the old goblin, hopping down off his 
stool and vanishing from sight. "I shall take you to your vault." 

He appeared around the end of the counter, jogging happily toward them, the contents of the 
leather bag still jingling. Travers was now standing quite still with his mouth hanging wide open. 
Ron was drawing attention to this odd phenomenon by regarding Travers with confusion. 

 ��Wait �C Bogrod!��

 Another goblin came scurrying around the counter. 

��We have instructions,�� he said with a bow to Hermione. ��Forgive me, Madam, but there have 
been special orders regarding the vault of Lestrange.��

 He whispered urgently in Bogrod��s ear, but the Imperiused goblin shook him off. 

��I am aware of the instructions, Madam Lestrange wishes to visit her vault ... Very old 
family ... old clients ... This way, please ...�� 

And, still clanking, he hurried toward one of the many doors leading off the hall. Harry looked 
back at Travers , who was still rooted to the spot looking abnormally vacant, and made his 
decision. With a flick of his wand he made Travers come with them, walking meekly in their wake 
as they reached the door and passed into the rough stone passageway beyond, which was lit with 
flaming torches. 

��We��re in trouble; they suspect,�� said Harry as the door slammed behind them and he pulled off 
the Invisibility Cloak. Griphook jumped down from his shoulders, neither Travers nor Bogrod 
showed the slightest surprise at the sudden appearance of Harry Potter in their midst. ��They��re 
Imperiused,�� he added, in response to Hermione and Ron��s confused queries about Travers and 
Bogrod, who were both now standing there looking blank. ��I don��t think I did it strongly enough, I 
don��t know ...�� 

And another memory darted through his mind, of the real Bellatrix Lestrange shrieking at him 

when he had first tried to use an Unforgivable Curse, ��You need to mean them, Potter!��

 ��What do we do?�� asked Ron. ��Shall we get out now, while we can?�� 

��If we can,�� said Hermione, looking back toward the door into the main hall, beyond which 

who knew what was happening.

��383ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��We��ve got this far, I say we go on,�� said Harry. 

��Good!�� said Griphook. ��So, we need Bogrod to control the cart; I no longer have the authority. 
But there will not be room for the wizard.��

 Harry pointed his wand at Travers. 

��Imperio!��

 The wizard turned and set off along the dark track at a smart pace.

 ��What are you making him do?�� 

��Hide,�� said Harry as he pointed his wand at Bogrod, who whistled to summon a little cart that 
came trundling along the tracks toward them out of the darkness. Harry was sure he could hear 
shouting behind them in the main hall as they all clambered into it, Bogrod in front of Griphook, 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione crammed together in the back. 

With a jerk the cart moved off, gathering speed, They hurried past Travers, who was wriggling 
into a crack in the wall, then the cart began twisting and turning through the labyrinthine passages, 
sloping downward all the time. Harry could not hear anything over the rattling of the cart on the 
tracks. His hair flew behind him as they swerved between stalactites, flying ever deeper into the 
earth, but he kept glancing back. They might as well have left enormous footprints behind them; 
the more he thought about it, the more foolish it seemed to have disguised Hermione as Bellatrix, 
to have brought along Bellatrix��s wand, when the Death Eaters knew who had stolen it �C 

They were deeper than Harry had ever penetrated within Gringotts; they took a hairpin bend at 
speed and saw ahead of them, with seconds to spare, a waterfall pounding over the track. Harry 
heard Griphook shout, ��No!�� but there was no braking. They zoomed through it. Water filled 
Harry��s eyes and mouth. He could not see or breathe. Then, with an awful lurch, the cart flipped 
over and they were all thrown out of it. Harry heard the cart smash into pieces against the passage 
wall, heard Hermione shriek something, and felt himself glide back toward the ground as though 
weightless, landing painlessly on the rocky passage floor. 

��C-Cushioning Charm,�� Hermione spluttered, as Ron pulled her to her feet, but to Harry��s 
horror he saw that she was no longer Bellatrix; instead she stood there in overlarge robes, sopping 
wet and completely herself; Ron was red-haired and beardless again. They were realizing it as they 
looked at each other, feeling their own faces. 

��The Thief��s Downfall!�� said Griphook, clambering to his feet and looking back the deluge

��384ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

onto the tracks, which, Harry knew now, had been more than water. ��It washes away all 
enchantment, all magical concealment! They know there are imposers in Gringotts, they have set 
off defenses against us!�� 

Harry saw Hermione checking that she still had the beaded bag, and hurriedly thrust his own 
hand under his jacket to make sure he had not lost the Invisibility Cloak. Then he turned to see 
Bogrod shaking his head in bewilderment, The Thief��s Downfall seemed to have lifted his 
Imperius Curse. 

��We need him,�� said Griphook, ��we cannot enter the vault without a Gringott��s goblin. And we 
need the clankers!�� 

��Imperio!�� Harry said again; his voice echoed through the stone passage as he felt again the 
sense of heady control that flowed from brain to wand. Bogrod submitted once more to his will, his 
befuddled expression changing to one of polite indifference, as Ron hurried to pick up the leather 
bag of metal tools. 

��Harry, I think I can hear people coming!�� said Hermione, and she pointed Bellatrix��s wand at 
the waterfall and cried, ��Protego!�� They saw the Shield Charm break the flow of enchanted water 
as it flew up the passageway.

 ��Good thinking,�� said Harry. ��Lead the way, Griphook!�� 

��How are we going to get out again?�� Ron asked as they hurried on foot into the darkness after 
the goblin, Bogrod panting in their wake like an old dog. 

��Let��s worry about that when we have to,�� said Harry. He was trying to listen. He thought he 
could hear something clanking and moving around nearby. ��Griphook, how much farther?��

 ��Not far, Harry Potter, not far ...�� 

And they turned a corner and saw the thing for which Harry had been prepared, but which still 

brought all of them to a halt. 

A gigantic dragon was tethered to the ground in front of them, barring access to four or five of 
the deepest vaults in the place. The beast��s scales had turned pale and flaky during its long 
incarceration��� 
under the ground, its eyes were milkily pink; both rear legs bore heavy cuffs��
�� 
from which chains led to enormous pegs driven deep into the rocky floor. Its great spiked 
wings, folded close to its body, would have filled the chamber if it spread them, and when it turned 
its ugly head toward them, it roared with a noise that made the rock tremble, opened its mouth and

��385ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

spat a jet of fire that sent them running back up the passageway. 

��It is partially blind,�� panted Griphook, ��but even more savage for that. However, we have the 
means to control it. It has learned what to expect when the Clankers come. Give them to me.�� 

Ron passed the bag to Griphook, and the goblin pulled out a number of small metal instruments 
that when shaken made a long ringing noise like miniature hammers on anvils���� 
. Griphook 
handed them out, Bogrod accepted his meekly. 

��You know what to do,�� Griphook told Harry, Ron, and Hermione. ��It will expect pain when it 
hears the noise. It will retreat, and Bogrod must place his palm upon the door of the vault.�� 

They advanced around the corner again, shaking the Clankers, and the noise echoed off the 
rocky walls, grossly magnified, so that the inside of Harry��s skull seemed to vibrate with the din. 
The dragon let out another hoarse roar, then retreated. Harry could see it trembling, and as they 
drew nearer he saw the scars made by vicious slashes across its face, and guess that it had been 
taught to fear hot swords when it heard the sound of the Clankers. 

��Make him press his hand to the door!�� Griphook urged Harry, who turned his wand again 
upon Bogrod. The old goblin obeyed, pressing his palm to the wood, and the door of the vault 
melted away to reveal a cavelike opening crammed from floor to ceiling with golden coins and 
goblets, silver armor, the skins of strange creatures �C some with long spines, other with drooping 
wings �C potions in jeweled flasks, and a skull still wearing a crown. 

��Search, fast!�� said Harry as they all hurried inside the vault. He had described Hufflepuff��s cap 
to Ron and Hermione, but if it was the other, unknown Horcrux that resided in this vault, he did 
not know what it looked like. He barely had time to glance around, however, before there was a 
muffled clunk from behind them. The door had reappeared, sealing them inside the vault, and they 
were plunged into total darkness. 

��No matter, Bogrod will be able to release us!�� said Griphook as Ron gave a shout of surprise. 

��Light your wands, can��t you? And hurry, we have little time!��

 ��Lumos!�� 

Harry shone his lit wand around the vault, its beam fell upon glittering jewels; he saw the fake 
sword of Gryffindor lying on a high shelf amongst a jumble of chains. Ron and Hermione had lit 
their wands too, and were now examining the piles of objects surrounding them.

 ��Harry, could this be - ? Aargh!��

��386ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hermione screamed in pain, and Harry turned his wand on her in time to see a jeweled goblet 
tumbling from her grip. But as it fell, it split, became a shower of goblets, so that a second later, 
with a great clatter, the floor was covered in identical cups rolling in every direction, the original 
impossible to discern amongst them.

 ��It burned me!�� moaned Hermione, sucking her blistered fingers.

 ��They have added Germino and Flagrante Curses!�� said Griphook. 

��Everything you touch will burn and multiply, but the copies are worthless �C and if you 
continue to handle the treasure, you will eventually be crushed to death by the weight of expanding 
gold!�� 

��Okay, don��t touch anything!�� said Harry desperately, but even as he said it, Ron accidentally 
nudged one of the fallen goblets with his foot, and twenty more exploded into being while Ron 
hopped on the spot, part of his shoe burned away by contact with the hot metal.

 ��Stand still, don��t move!�� said Hermione, clutching at Ron. 

��Just look around!�� said Harry. ��Remember, the cup��s small and gold, it��s got a badger 
engraved on it, two handles �C otherwise see if you can spot Ravenclaw��s symbol anywhere, the 
eagle �C�� 

They directed their wands into every nook and crevice, turning cautiously on the spot. It was 
impossible not to brush up against anything; Harry sent a great cascade of fake Galleons onto the 
ground where they joined the goblets, and now there was scarcely room to place their feet, and the 
glowing gold blazed with heat, so that the vault felt like a furnace. Harry��s wandlight passed over 
shields and goblin-made helmets set on shelves rising to the ceiling; higher and higher he raised 
the beam, until suddenly it found an object that made his heart skip and his hand tremble.

 ��It��s there, it��s up there!�� 

Ron and Hermione pointed there wands at it too, so that the little golden cup sparkled in a 
three-way spotlight, the cup that had belonged to Helga Hufflepuff, which had passed into the 
possession of Hepzibah Smith, from whom it had been stolen by Tom Riddle.

 ��And how the hell are we going to get up there without touching anything?�� asked Ron. 

��Accio Cup!�� cried Hermione, who had evidently forgotten in her desperation what Griphook 
had told them during their planning sessions. 

 ��No use, no use!�� snarled the goblin.

��387ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Then what do we do?�� said Harry, glaring at the goblin. ��If you want the sword, Griphook, 
then you��ll have to help us more than �C wait! Can I touch stuff with the sword? Hermione, give it 
here!�� 

Hermione fumbled insider her robes, drew out a beaded bag, rummaged for a few seconds, then 
removed the shining sword. Harry seized it by its rubied hilt and touched the tip of the blade to a 
silver flagon��ƺ�;��Ƕ̾�ƿ 
nearby, which did not multiply.

 ��If I can just poke the sword through a handle �C but how am I going to get up there?�� 

The shelf on which the cup reposed was out of reach for any of them, even Ron, who was 
tallest. The heat from the enchanted treasure rose in waves, and sweat ran down Harry��s face and 
back as he struggled to think of a way up to the cup; and then he heard the dragon roar on the other 
side of the vault door, and the sound of clanking growing louder and louder. 

They were truly trapped now. There was no way out except through the door, and a horde of 
goblins seemed to be approaching on the other side. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and saw 
terror in their faces. 

��Hermione,�� said Harry, as the clanking grew louder, ��I��ve got to get up there, we��ve got to get 

rid of it �C��

 She raised her wand, pointed it at Harry, and whispered, ��Levicorpus.�� 

Hoisted into the air by his ankle, Harry hit a suit of armor and replicas burst out of it like white-
hot bodies, filling the cramped space. With screams of pain, Ron, Hermione, and the two goblins 
were knocked aside into other objects, which also began to replicate. Half buried in a rising tide of 
red-hot treasure, they struggled and yelled has Harry thrust the sword through the handle of 
Hufflepuff��s cup, hooking it onto the blade. 

��Impervius!�� screeched Hermione in an attempt to protect herself, Ron, and the goblins from 
the burning metal. 

Then the worst scream yet made Harry look down, Ron and Hermione were waist deep in 
treasure, struggling to keep Bogrod from slipping beneath the rising tide, but Griphook had sunk 
out of sight; and nothing but the tips of a few long fingers were left in view. 

 Harry seized Griphook��s fingers and pulled. The blistered goblin emerged by degrees, howling. 

��Liberatocorpus!�� yelled Harry, and with a crash he and Griphook landed on the surface of the 
swelling treasure, and the sword flew out of Harry��s hand. 

��388ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Get it!�� Harry yelled, fighting the pain of the hot metal on his skin, as Griphook clambered 
onto his shoulders again, determined to avoid the swelling mass of red-hot objects. ��Where��s the 
sword? It had the cup on it!��

 The clanking on the other side of the door was growing deafening �C it was too late �C 

 ��There!�� 

It was Griphook who had seen it and Griphook who lunged, and in that instant Harry knew that 
the goblin had never expected them to keep their word. One hand holding tightly to a fistful of 
Harry��s hair, to make sure he did not fall into the heaving sea of burning gold, Griphook seized the 
hilt of the sword and swung it high out of Harry��s reach. The tiny golden cup, skewered (���棬 
impale) by the handle on the sword��s blade was flung into the air. The goblin astride him, Harry 
dived and caught it, and although he could feel it scalding his flesh he did not relinquish it, even 
while countless Hufflepuff cups burst from his fist, raining down upon him as the entrance of the 
vault opened up again and he found himself sliding uncontrollably on an expanding avalanche of 
fiery gold and silver that bore him, Ron, Hermione into the outer chamber. 

Hardly aware of the pain from the burns covering his body, and still borne along the swell of 
replicating treasure, Harry shoved the cup into his pocket and reached up to retrieve the sword, but 
Griphook was gone. Sliding from Harry��s shoulders the moment he could, he had sprinted for 
cover amongst the surrounding goblins, brandishing the sword and crying, ��Thieves! Thieves! 
Help! Thieves!�� He vanished into the midst of the advancing crowd, all of whom were holding 
daggers and who accepted him without question. 

Slipping on the hot metal, Harry struggled to his feet and knew that the only way out was 
through. 

��Stupefy!�� he bellowed, and Ron and Hermione joined in. Jets of red light flew into the crowd 
of goblins, and some toppled over, but others advanced, and Harry saw several wizard guards 
running around the corner. 

The tethered dragon let out a roar, and a gush of flame flew over the goblins. The wizards fled, 
doubled-up, back the way they had come, and inspiration, or madness, came to Harry. Pointing his 
wand at the thick cuffs chaining the beast to the floor, he yelled, ��Relashio!��

 The cuffs broken open with loud bangs. 

��This way!�� Harry yelled, and still shooting Stunning Spells at the advancing goblins, he

��389ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

sprinted toward the blind dragon.

 ��Harry �C Harry �C what are you doing?�� cried Hermione.

 ��Get up, climb up, come on �C�� 

The dragon had not realized that it was free, Harry��s foot found the crook of its hind leg and he 
pulled himself up onto its back. The scales were hard as steel; it did not even seem to feel him. He 
stretched out an arm; Hermione hoisted herself up; Ron climbed on behind them, and a second 
later the dragon became aware that it was untethered. 

With a roar it reared�ú���վ��, Harry dug in his knees, clutching as tightly as he could to the 
jagged scales as the wings opened, knocking the shrieking goblins aside like skittles������Ϸ�õ�
С��, and it soared into the air. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, flat on its back, scraped against the 
ceiling as it dived toward the passage opening, while the pursuing goblins hurled daggers that 
glanced (bounce) off its flanks. 

��We��ll never get out, it��s too big!�� Hermione screamed, but the dragon opened its mouth and 
belched flame again, blasting the tunnel, whose floors and ceiling cracked and crumbled. By sheer 
force, the dragon clawed and fought its way through. Harry��s eyes were shut tight against the heat 
and dust. Deafened by the crash of rock and the dragon��s roars, he could only cling to its back, 
expecting to be shaken off at any moment; then he heard Hermione yelling, ��Defidio!�� 

She was helping the dragon enlarge the passageway, carving out the ceiling as it struggled 
upward toward the fresher air, away from the shrieking and clanking goblins. Harry and Ron 
copied her, blasting the ceiling apart with more gouging spells. They passed the underground lake, 
and the great crawling, snarling beast seemed to sense freedom and space ahead of it, and behind 
them the passage was full of the dragon��s thrashing, spiked tail, of great lumps of rock, gigantic 
fractured stalactites, and the clanking of the goblins seemed to be growing more muffled, while 
ahead, the dragon��s fire kept their progress clear. 

And then at last, by the combined force of their spells and the dragon��s brute strength���� 
, 
they had blasted their way out of the passage into the marble hallway. Goblins and wizards 
shrieked and ran for cover, and finally the dragon had room to stretch its wings, Turning its horned 
head toward the cool outside air it could smell beyond the entrance, it took off, and with Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione still clinging to its back, it forced its way through the metal doors, leaving 
them buckled and hanging from their hinges, as it staggered into Diagon Alley and launched itself

Chapter Twenty-Seven 
The Final Hiding Place 



There was no means of steering; the dragon could not 


see where 
it was going, and Harry knew that if it turned sharply or 

rolled in 
midair they would find it impossible to cling onto its 

broad 
back. Nevertheless, as they climbed higher and higher, 

London 
unfurling below them like a gray-and-green map. Harry's 
overwhelming feeling was of gratitude for an escape that 

had 
seemed impossible. Crouching low over the beast's neck, he clung tight to the metallic scales, and 
the cool breeze was soothing on his burned and blistered skin, the dragon's wings beating the air 
like the sails of a windmill. Behind him, whether from delight or fear he could not tell, Ron kept 
swearing at the top of his voice, and Hermione seemed to be sobbing. 

After five minutes or so, Harry lost some of his immediate dread that the dragon was going to 
throw them off, for it seemed intent on nothing but getting as far away from its underground prison 
as possible; but the question of how and when they were to dismount remained rather frightening. 
He had no idea how long dragons could fly without landing, nor how this particular dragon, which 
could barely see, would locate a good place to put down. He glanced around constantly, imagining 
that he could feel his scar prickling. 

How long would it be before Voldemort knew that they had broken into the Lestranges' vault? 
How soon would the goblins of Gringotts notify Bellatrix? How quickly would they realize what 
had been taken? And then, when they discovered that the golden cup was missing? Voldemort 
would know, at last, that they were hunting Horcruxes. 

The dragon seemed to crave cooler and fresher air. It climbed steadily until they were flying 
through wisps of chilly cloud, and Harry could no longer make out the little colored dots which 
were cars pouring in and out of the capital. On and on they flew, over countryside parceled 
(covered, wrapped) out in patches of green and brown, over roads and rivers winding through the 
landscape like strips of matte (not glossy) and glossy ribbon. 

"What do you reckon it's looking for?" Ron yelled as they flew farther and farther north. 

"No idea," Harry bellow back. His hands were numb with cold but he did not dare attempt to

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

shift his grip. He had been wondering for some time what they would do if they saw the coast sail 
beneath them, if the dragon headed for open sea; he was cold and numb, not to mention 
desperately hungry and thirsty. When, he wondered, had the beast itself last eaten? Surely it would 
need sustenance before long? And what if, at that point, it realized it had three highly edible 
humans sitting on its back? 

The sun slipped lower in the sky, which was turning indigo; and still the dragon flew, cities and 
towns gliding out of sight beneath them, its enormous shadow sliding over the earth like a giant 
dark cloud. Every part of Harry ached with the effort of holding on to the dragon's back. 

"Is it my imagination," shouted Ron after a considerable stretch of silence, "or are we losing 
height?" 

Harry looked down and saw deep green mountains and lakes, coppery in the sunset. The 
landscape seemed to grow larger and more detailed as he squinted over the side of the dragon, and 
he wondered whether it had divined the presence of fresh water by the flashes of reflected sunlight. 

Lower and lower the dragon flew, in great spiraling circles, honing in (concentrate on, focus 
on), it seemed, upon one of the smaller lakes. 

"I say we jump when it gets low enough!" Harry called back to the others. "Straight into the 
water before it realizes we're here!" They agreed, Hermione a little faintly, and now Harry could 
see the dragon's wide yellow underbelly rippling in the surface of the water. 

"NOW!" 

He slithered over the side of the dragon and plummeted feetfirst toward the surface of the lake; 
the drop was greater than he had estimated and he hit the water hard, plunging like a stone into a 
freezing, green, reed-filled world. He kicked toward the surface and emerged, panting, to see 
enormous ripples emanating in circles from the places where Ron and Hermione had fallen. The 
dragon did not seem to have noticed anything; it was already fifty feet away, swooping low over 
the lake to scoop up water in its scarred snout. As Ron and Hermione emerged, spluttering and 
gasping, from the depths of the lake, the dragon flew on, its wings beating hard, and landed at last 
on a distant bank. 

Harry, Ron and Hermione struck out (swim with vigor) for the opposite shore. The lake did not 
seem to be deep. Soon it was more a question of fighting their way through reeds and mud than 
swimming, and at last they flopped, sodden, panting, and exhausted, onto slippery grass.

Hermione collapsed, coughing and shuddering. Though Harry could have happily lain down and 
slept, he staggered to his feet, drew out his wand, and started casting the usual protective spells 
around them. 

When he had finished, he joined the others. It was the first time that he had seen them properly 
since escaping from the vault. Both had angry red burns all over their faces and arms, and their 
clothing was singed away in places. They were wincing as they dabbed essence of dittany onto 
their many injuries. Hermione handed Harry the bottle, then pulled out three bottles of pumpkin 
juice she had brought from Shell Cottage and clean, dry robes for all of them. They changes and 
then gulped down the juice. 

"Well, on the upside," said Ron finally, who was sitting watching the skin on his hands regrow, 
"we got the Horcrux. On the downside -" 

"-no sword," said Harry through gritted teeth, as he dripped dittany through the singed hole in 
his jeans onto the angry burn beneath. 

"No sword," repeated Ron. "That double-crossing little scab...�� 

Harry pulled the Horcrux from the pocket of the wet jacket he had just taken off and set it down 
on the grass in front of them. Glinting in the sun, it drew their eyes as they swigged their bottles of 
juice. 

"At least we can't wear it this time, that'd look a bit weird hanging around our necks," said Ron, 
wiping his mouth on the back of his hand. 

Hermione looked across the lake to the far bank where the dragon was still drinking. "What'll 
happen to it, do you think?" she asked, "Will it be alright?" 

"You sound like Hagrid," said Ron, "It's a dragon, Hermione, it can look after itself. It's us we 
need to worry about." 

"What do you mean?" 

"Well I don't know how to break this to you," said Ron, "but I think they might have noticed we 

broke into Gringotts." 

All three of them started to laugh, and once started, it was difficult to stop. Harry's ribs ached, he 
felt lightheaded with hunger, but he lay back on the grass beneath the reddening sky and laughed 
until his throat was raw. 

"What are we going to do, though?" said Hermione finally, hiccuping herself back to

��394ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

seriousness. "He'll know, won't he? You-Know-Who will know we know about his Horcruxes!" 

"Maybe they'll be too scared to tell him!" said Ron hopefully, "Maybe they'll cover up -" 

The sky, the smell of the lake water, the sound of Ron's voice were extinguished. Pain cleaved 
Harry's head like a sword stroke. He was standing in a dimly lit room, and a semicircle of wizards 
faced him, and on the floor at his feet knelt a small, quaking figure. 

"What did you say to me?" His voice was high and cold, but fury and fear burned inside him. 
The one thing that he had dreaded -but it could not be true, he could not see how. The goblin was 
trembling, unable to meet the red eyes high above his. 

"Say it again!" murmured Voldemort. "Say it again!" 

"M-my Lord," stammered the goblin, its black eyes wide with terror, "m-my Lord... we t-tried to 
st-stop them... Im-impostors, my Lord... broke - broke into the - into the Lestranges' vault...�� 

"Impostors? What impostors? I thought Gringotts had ways of revealing impostors? Who were 
they?�� 

"It was... it was... the P-Potter b-boy and the t-two accomplices...�� 

"And they took?" he said, his voice rising, a terrible fear gripping him, "Tell me! What did they 

take?" 

"A... a s-small golden c-cup m-my Lord...�� 

The scream of rage, of denial left him as if it were a stranger's. He was crazed, frenzied, it could 
not be true, it was impossible, nobody had known. How was it possible that the boy could have 
discovered his secret? 

The Elder Wand slashed through the air and green light erupted through the room; the kneeling 
goblin rolled over dead; the watching wizards scattered before him, terrified. Bellatrix and Lucius 
Malfoy threw others behind them in their race for the door, and again and again his wand fell, and 
those who were left were slain, all of them, for bringing him this news, for hearing about the 
golden cup. 

Alone amongst the dead he stomped up and down, and they passed before him in vision, his 
treasures, his safeguards, his anchors (����������) to immortality - the diary was destroyed and the 
cup was stolen. What if, what if, the boy knew about the others? Could he know, had he already 
acted, had he traced more of them? Was Dumbledore at the root of this? Dumbledore, who had 
always suspected him; Dumbledore, dead on his orders; Dumbledore, whose wand was his now,

��395ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

yet who reached out from the ignominy of death through the boy, the boy - 

But surely if the boy had destroyed any of his Horcruxes, he, Lord Voldemort, would have 
known, would have felt it? He, the greatest wizard of them all; he, the most powerful; he, the killer 
of Dumbledore and of how many other worthless, nameless men. How could Lord Voldemort not 
have known, if he, himself, most important and precious, had been attacked, mutilated? 

True, he had not felt it when the diary had been destroyed, but he had thought that was because 
he had no body to fell, being less than ghost... No, surely, the rest were safe... The other Horcruxes 
must be intact... 

But he must know, he must be sure... He paced the room, kicking aside the goblin's corpse as he 
passed, and the pictures blurred and burned in his boiling brain, the lake, the shack, and Hogwarts 


A modicum���� 
of calm cooled his rage now. How could the boy know that he had hidden the 
ring in the Gaunt shack? No one had ever known him to be related to the Gaunts, he had hidden the 
connection, the killings had never been traced to him. The ring, surely, was safe. 

And how could the boy, or anybody else, know about the cave or penetrate its protection? The 
idea of the locket being stolen was absurd... 

As for the school, he alone knew where in Hogwarts he had stowed the Horcrux, because he 
alone had plumbed̽��/��the deepest secrets of that place... And there was still Nagini, who must 
remain close now, no longer sent to do his bidding, under his protection... 

But to be sure, to be utterly sure, he must return to each of his hiding places, he must redouble 
protection around each of his Horcruxes... A job, like the quest for the Elder Wand, that he must 
undertake alone... 

Which should he visit first, which was in most danger? An old unease flickered inside him. 
Dumbledore had known his middle name... Dumbledore might have made the connection with the 
Gaunts... Their abandoned home was, perhaps, the least secure of his hiding places, it was there 
that he would go first... 

The lake, surely impossible... though was there a slight possibility that Dumbledore might have 
known some of his past misdeeds, through the orphanage. 

And Hogwarts... but he knew that his Horcrux there was safe; it would be impossible for Potter 
to enter Hogsmeade without detection, let alone the school. Nevertheless, it would be prudent to 
alert Snape to the fact that the boy might try to reenter the castle. ... To tell Snape why the boy

��396ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

might return would be foolish, of course; it had been a grave mistake to trust Bellatrix and Malfoy. 
Didn't their stupidity and carelessness prove how unwise it was ever to trust? 

He would visit the Gaunt shack first, then, and take Nagini with him. He would not be parted 
from the snake anymore ... and he strode from the room, through the hall, and out into the dark 
garden where the fountain played; he called the snake in Parseltongue and it slithered out to join 
him like a long shadow. ... 

Harry's eyes flew open as he wrenched himself back to the present. He was lying on the bank of 
the lake in the setting sun, and Ron and Hermione were looking down at him. Judging by their 
worried looks, and by the continued pounding of his scar, his sudden excursion (trip) into 
Voldemort's mind had not passed unnoticed. He struggled up, shivering, vaguely surprised that he 
was still wet to his skin, and saw the cup lying innocently in the grass before him, and the lake, 
deep blue shot with gold in the falling sun. 

"He knows." His own voice sounded strange and low after Voldemort's high screams. "He 
knows and he's going to check where the others are, and the last one," he was already on his feet, 
"is at Hogwarts. I knew it. I knew it." 

"What?" 

Ron was gaping at him; Hermione sat up, looking worried. "But what did you see? How do you 
know?" 

"I saw him find out about the cup, I - I was in his head, he's -" Harry remembered the killings "he's 
seriously angry, and scared too, he can't understand how we knew, and now he's going to 
check the others are safe, the ring first. He thinks the Hogwarts one is safest, because Snape's 
there, because it'll be so hard not to be seen getting in. I think he'll check that one last, but he could 
still be there within hours -" 

"Did you see where in Hogwarts it is?" asked Ron, now scrambling to his feet too. 

"No, he was concentrating on warning Snape, he didn't think about exactly where it is -" 

"Wait, wait!" cried Hermione as Ron caught up to the Horcrux and Harry pulled out the 
Invisibility Cloak again. "We can't just go, we haven't got a plan, we need to -" 

"We need to get going," said Harry firmly. He had been hoping to sleep, looking forward to 
getting into the new tent, but that was impossible now, "Can you imagine what he's going to do 
once he realizes the ring and the locket are gone? What if he moves the Hogwarts Horcrux, decides

��397ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

it isn't safe enough? 

"But how are we going to get in?" 

"We'll go to Hogsmeade," said Harry, "and try to work something out once we see what the 

protection around the school's like. Get under the Cloak, Hermione, I want to stick together this 

time." 

"But we don't really fit -" 

"It'll be dark, no one's going to notice our feet." 

The flapping of enormous wings echoed across the black water. The dragon had drunk its fill 
and risen into the air. They paused in their preparations to watch it climb higher and higher, now 
black against the rapidly darkening sky, until it vanished over a nearby mountain. Then Hermione 
walked forward and took her place between the other two, Harry pulled the Cloak down as far as it 
would go, and together they turned on the spot into the crushing darkness.

Chapter Twenty-Eight 

The Missing Mirror 

Harry's feet touched the road. He saw the 


achingly 
familiar Hogsmeade High Street, dark shop fronts, 

and the mist 
line of black mountains beyond the village and the 

curve in the 
road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light 

spilling from 
the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a 

lurch of the 
heart, he remembered with piercing accuracy how 

he had landed 
here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately 

weak 
Dumbledore, all this in a second, upon landing -and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron's 
and Hermione's arms, it happened. 

The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort's when he had realized the cup had 
been stolen. It tore at every nerve in Harry's body, and he knew that their appearance had caused it. 

Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst 
open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the streets, their wands aloft. 

Harry seized Ron's wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to stun. Even 
attempting it would have give away their position. One of the Death Eaters raised his wand, and 
the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains. 

"Accio Cloak!" roared one of the Death Eaters Harry seized his folds, but it made no attempt to 
escape. The Summoning Charm had not worked on it. 

"Not under your wrapper, then, Potter?" yelled the Death Eater who had tried the charm and 
then to his fellows. "Spread now. He's here." 

Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them, Harry, Ron and Hermione backed as quickly as 
possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in 
the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street 
from the Death Eaters' searching wands. 

"Let's just leave!" Hermione whispered. "Disapparate now!" 

"Great idea," said Ron, but before Harry could reply, a Death Eater shouted, "We know you are 
here, Potter, and there's no getting away! We'll find you!"

��399ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"They were ready for us," whispered Harry. "They set up that spell to tell them we'd come. I 
reckon they��ve done something to keep us here, trap us -" 

"What about dementors?" called another Death Eater. "Let'em have free rein, they'd find him 
quick enough!" 

"The Dark Lord wants Potter dead by no hands but his -" 

"- an' dementors won't kill him! The Dark Lord wants Potter's life, nor his soul. He'll be easier to 
kill if he's been Kissed first!" 

There were noises of agreement. Dread filled Harry. To repel dementors they would have to 
produce Patronuses which would give them away immediately. 

"We're going to have to try to Disapparate, Harry!" Hermione whispered. 

Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold being spread over the street. Light was sucked 
from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch blackness, he felt 
Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot. 

The air through which they needed to move, seemed to have become solid. They could not 
Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper 
into Harry's flesh. He, Ron and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along 
the wall trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, 
ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with 
their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry 
was sure of it. They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling 
breaths he detested, tasting despair in the air, closing in. He raised his wand, He could not, would 
not suffer the Dementor's Kiss, whatever happened afterward. 

It was of Ron and Hermione that he thought as he whispered "Expecto Patronum!" 

The silver stag burst from his wand and charged. The Dementors scattered and there was a 
triumphant yell from somewhere out of sight "It's him, down there, down there, I saw his Patronus, 
it was a stag!" 

The Dementors have retreated, the stars were popping out again and the footsteps of the Death 
Eaters were becoming louder; but before Harry in his panic could decide what to do, there was a 
grinding of bolts nearby, a door opened on the left-side of the narrow street, and a rough voice 
said, "Potter, in here, quick!"

��400ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He obeyed without hesitation, the three of them hurried through the open doorway. 

"Upstairs, keep the Cloak on, keep quiet!" muttered a tall figure, passing them on his way into 
the street and slammed the door behind him. 

Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single 
candle, the grubby, sawdust bar of the Hog's Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a 
second doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase, that they climbed as fast as they could. 
The stairs opened into a sitting room with a durable carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung 
a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of a vacant 
sweetness. 

Shouts reached from the streets below. Still wearing the Invisibility Cloak on, they hurried 
toward the grimy window and looked down. Their savior, whom Harry now recognized as the 
Hog's Head's barman, was the only person not wearing a hood. 

"So what?" he was bellowing into one of the hooded faces. "So what? You send dementors 
down my street, I'll send a Patronus back at 'em! I'm not having 'em near me, I've told you that. I'm 
not having it!" 

"That wasn't your Patronus," said a Death Eater. "That was a stag. It was Potter's!" 

"Stag!" roared the barman, and he pulled out a wand. "Stag! You idiot - Expecto Patronum!" 

Something huge and horned erupted from the wand. Head down, it charged toward the High 
Street, and out of sight. 

"That's not what I saw," said the Death Eater, though was less certainly. 

"Curfew's been broken, you heard the noise," one of his companions told the barman. "Someone 

was out on the streets against regulations -" 

"If I want to put my cat out, I will, and be damned to your curfew!" 

"You set off the Caterwauling Charm?" 

"What if I did? Going to cart me off to Azkaban? Kill me for sticking my nose out my own front 
door? Do it, then, if you want to! But I hope for your sakes you haven't pressed your little Dark 
Marks, and summoned him. He's not going to like being called here, for me and my old cat, is he, 
now?" 

"Don't worry about us." said one of the Death Eaters, "worry about yourself, breaking curfew!" 

"And where will you lot traffic potions and poisons when my pub's closed down? What will

��401ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

happen to your little sidelines��ҵ 
then?" 

"Are you threatening -?" 

"I keep my mouth shut, it's why you come here, isn't it?" 

"I still say I saw a stag Patronus!" shouted the first Death Eater. 

"Stag?" roared the barman. "It's a goat, idiot!" 

"All right, we made a mistake," said the second Death Eater. "Break curfew again and we won't 

be so lenient!" 

The Death Eaters strode back towards the High Street. Hermione moaned with relief, wove out 
from under the Cloak, and sat down on a wobble-legged chair. Harry drew the curtains then pulled 
the Cloak off himself and Ron. They could hear the barman down below, rebolting the door of the 
bar, then climbing the stairs. 

Harry's attention was caught by something on the mantelpiece, a small, rectangular mirror, 

propped on top of it, right beneath the portrait of the girl. 

The barman entered the room. 

"You bloody fools," he said gruffly, looking from one to the other of them. "What were you 

thinking, coming here?" 

"Thank you," said Harry. "We can't thank you enough. You saved our lives!" 

The barman grunted. Harry approached him looking up into the face, trying to see past the long, 

stringy, wire-gray hair beard. He wore spectacles. Behind the dirty lenses, the eyes were a 

piercing, brilliant blue. 

"It's your eye I've been seeing in the mirror." 

There was a silence in the room. Harry and the barman looked at each other. 

"You sent Dobby." 

The barman nodded and looked around for the elf. "Thought he'd be with you. Where've you left 

him? 

��He��s dead,�� said Harry, ��Bellatrix Lestrange killed him.�� 

The barman face was impassive. After a few moments he said, "I'm sorry to hear it, I liked that 

elf." 

He turned away, lightning lamps with prods of his wand, not looking at any of them. 

"You're Aberforth," said Harry to the man's back.

��402ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He neither confirmed or denied it, but bent to light the fire. 

"How did you get this?" Harry asked, walking across to Sirius's mirror, the twin of the one he 
had broken nearly two years before. 

"Bought it from Dung 'bout a year ago," said Aberforth. "Albus told me what it was. Been trying 
to keep an eye out for you." 

Ron gasped. "The silver doe," he said excitedly, "Was that you too?" 

"What are you talking about?" asked Aberforth. 

"Someone sent a doe Patronus to us!" 

"Brains like that, you could be a Death Eater, son. Haven't I just prove my Patronus is a goat?" 

"Oh," said Ron, "Yeah, well, I'm hungry!" he added defensively as his stomach gave an 

enormous rumble. 

"I got food," said Aberforth, and he sloped out of the room, reappearing moments later with a 
large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set upon a small table in 
front of the fire. 

Ravenous, they ate and drank, and for a while there was silence but for the crackle of the fire, 
and the clink of goblets and the sound of chewing. 

"Right then," said Aberforth when they had eaten their fill and Harry and Ron sat slumped 
cozily in their chairs. "We need to think of the best way to get you out of here. Can't be done by 
night, you heard what happens if anyone moves outdoors during darkness, Caterwauling Charm's 
set off, they'll be onto you like bowtruckles on doxy eggs. I don't reckon I'll be able to pass of a 
stag as a goat a second time. Wait for daybreak when curfew lifts, then you can put your Cloak 
back on and set out on foot. Get right out of Hogsmeade, up into the mountains, and you'll be able 
to Disapparate there. Might see Hagrid. He's been hiding in a cave up there with Grawp ever since 
they tried to arrest him." 

"We're not leaving," said Harry. "We need to get into Hogwarts." 

"Don't be stupid, boy," said Aberforth. 

"We've got to," said Harry. 

"What you've got to do," said Aberforth, leaning forward, "is to get as far from here as you can." 

"You don't understand. There isn't much time. We've got to get into the castle. Dumbledore -I 
mean, your brother - wanted us -"

��403ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The firelight made the grimy lenses of Aberforth's glasses momentarily opaque, a bright flat 
white, and Harry remembered the blind eyes of the giant spider, Aragog. 

"My brother Albus wanted a lot of things," said Aberforth, "and people had a habit of getting 
hurt while he was carrying out his grand plans. You get away from this school, Potter, and out of 
the country if you can. Forget my brother and his clever schemes. He's gone where none of this can 
hurt him, and you don't owe him anything." 

"You don't understand." said Harry again. 

"Oh, don't I?" said Aberforth quietly. "You don't think I understood my own brother? Think you 
know Albus better than I did?" 

"I didn't mean that," said Harry, whose brain felt sluggish with exhaustion and from the surfeit
��ʳ���� 
of food and wine. 

"It's... he left me a job." 

"Did he now?" said Aberforth. "Nice job, I hope? Pleasant? Easy? Sort of thing you'd expect an 

unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?" 

Ron gave a rather grim laugh. Hermione was looking strained. 

"I -it's not easy, no," said Harry. "But I've got to -" 

"Got to? Why got to? He's dead, isn't he?" said Aberforth roughly. "Let it go, boy, before you 

follow him! Save yourself!" 

"I can't." 

"Why not?" 

"I -" Harry felt overwhelmed; he could not explain, so he took the offensive instead. "But you're 

fighting too, you're in the Order of the Phoenix -" 

"I was," said Aberforth. "The Order of the Phoenix is finished. You-Know-Who's won, it's over, 
and anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves. It'll never be safe for you here, Potter, 
he wants you too badly. So go abroad, go into hiding, save yourself. Best take these two with you." 
He jerked a thumb at Ron and Hermione. 

"They'll be in danger as long as they live now everyone knows they've been working with you." 

"I can't leave," said Harry. "I've got a job -" 

"Give it to someone else!" 

"I can't. It's got to be me, Dumbledore explained it all -" 

��404ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Oh, did he now? And did he tell you everything, was he honest with you?" 

Harry wanted with all his heart to say "Yes," but somehow the simple word would not rise to his 
lips. Aberforth seemed to know what he was thinking. 

"I knew my brother, Potter. He learned secrecy at our mother's knee. Secrets and lies, that's how 
we grew up, and Albus... he was a natural." The old man's eyes traveled to the painting of the girl 
over the mantelpiece. It was, now Harry looked around properly, the only picture in the room. 
There was no photograph of Albus Dumbledore, nor of anyone else. 

"Mr. Dumbledore" said Hermione rather timidly. "Is that your sister? Ariana? 

"Yes." said Aberforth tersely. "Been reading Rita Skeeter, have you, missy?" 

Even by the rosy light of the fire it was clear that Hermione had turned red. 

"Elphias Doge mentioned her to us," said Harry, trying to spare Hermione. 

"That old berk (British Slang) idiot, stupid person)," muttered Aberforth, taking another swig of 
mead. "Thought the sun shone out of my brother's every office, he did. Well, so did plenty of 
people, you three included, by the looks of it." 

Harry kept quiet. He did not want to express the doubts and uncertainties about Dumbledore that 
had riddled him for months now. He had made his choice while he dug Dobby's grave, he had 
decided to continue along the winding, dangerous path indicated for him by Albus Dumbledore, to 
accept that he had not been told everything that he wanted to know, but simply to trust. He had no 
desire to doubt again; he did not want to hear anything that would deflect him from his purpose. 
He met Aberforth's gaze, which was so strikingly like his brothers', The bright blue eyes gave the 
same impression that they were X-raying the object of their scrutiny, and Harry thought that 
Aberforth knew what he was thinking and despised him for it. 

"Professor Dumbledore cared about Harry, very much," said Hermione in a low voice. 

"Did he now?" said Aberforth. "Funny thing how many of the people my brother cared about 
very much ended up in a worse state than if he'd left 'em well alone." 

"What do you mean?" asked Hermione breathlessly. 

"Never you mind," said Aberforth. 

"But that's a really serious thing to say!" said Hermione. "Are you -are you talking about your 
sister?" 

Aberforth glared at her, his lips moved as if he were chewing the words he was holding back.

Then he burst into speech. 

"When my sister was six years old, she was attacked by three Muggle boys. They'd seen her 
doing magic, spying through the back garden hedge, She was a kid, she couldn't control it, no 
witch or wizard can at that age. What they saw, scared them, I expect. They forced their way 
through the hedge, and when she couldn't show them the trick, they got a bit carried away trying to 
stop the little freak doing it." 

Hermione's eyes were huge in the firelight; Ron looked slightly sick. Aberforth stood up, tall as 
Albus, and suddenly terrible in his anger and the intensity of his pain. 

"It destroyed her, what they did. She was never right again. She wouldn't use magic, but she 
couldn't get rid of it; it turned inward and drove her mad, it exploded out of her when she couldn't 
control it, and at times she was strange and dangerous. But mostly she was sweet and scared and 
harmless. 

"And my father went after the bastards that did it," said Aberforth, "and attacked them. And they 
locked him up in Azkaban for it. He never said why he'd done it, because if the Ministry had 
known what Ariana had become, she'd have been locked up in St. Mungo's for good. They'd have 
seen her as a serious threat to the International Statute of Secrecy, unbalanced like she was, with 
magic exploding out of her at moments when she couldn't keep it in any longer. 

"We had to keep her safe and quiet. We moved house, put it about she was ill, and my mother 
looked after her, and tried to keep her calm and happy. 

"I was her favourite," he said, and as he said it, a grubby schoolboy seemed to look out through 
Aberforth's wrinkles and tangled beard. "Not Albus, he was always up in his bedroom when he 
was home, reading his books and counting his prizes, keeping up with his correspondence with 
"the most notable magical names of the day," Aberforth sneered. "He didn't want to be bothered 
with her. She liked me best. I could get her to eat when she wouldn't do it for my mother, I could 
calm her down, when she was in one of her rages, and when she was quiet, she used to help me 
feed the goats. 

"Then, when she was fourteen... See, I wasn't there." said Aberforth. "If I'd been there, I could 
have calmed her down. She had one of her rages, and my mother wasn't as young as she was, 
and ... it was an accident. Ariana couldn't control it. But my mother was killed." 

Harry felt a horrible mixture of pity and repulsion; he did not want to hear any more, but

��406ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Aberforth kept talking, and Harry wondered how long it had been since he had spoken about this; 
whether, in fact, he had ever spoken about it. 

"So that put paid to (frustrate, put a stop to) Albus's trip round the world with little Doge. The 
pair of 'em came home for my mother's funeral and then Doge went off on his own, and Albus 
settled down as head of the family. Ha!" Aberforth spat into the fire. 

"I'd have looked after her, I told him so. I didn't care about school. I'd have stayed home and 
done it. He told me I had to finish my education and he'd take over from my mother. Bit of a 
comedownʧ�� 
for Mr. Brilliant, there's no prizes for looking after your half-mad sister, stopping 
her blowing up the house every other day. But he did all right for a few weeks ... till he came." 

And now a positively dangerous look crept over Aberforth��s face. 

"Grindelwald. And at last, my brother had an equal to talk to, someone just as bright and 
talented as he was. And looking after Ariana took a backseat then, while they were hatching all 
their plans for a new Wizarding order and looking for Hallows, and whatever else it was they were 
so interested in. Grand plans for the benefit of all Wizardkind, and if one young girl neglected, 
what did that matter, when Albus was working for the greater good? 

"But after a few weeks of it, I'd had enough, I had. It was nearly time for me to go hack to 
Hogwarts, so I told 'em, both of 'em, face-to-face, like I am to you, now," and Aberforth looked 
downward Harry, and it took a little imagination to see him as a teenager, wiry and angry, 
confronting his elder brother. 

"I told him, you'd better give it up now. You can't move her, she's in no fit state, you can't take 
her with you, wherever it is you're planning to go, when you're making your clever speeches, 
trying to whip yourselves up a following. He didn't like that." said Aberforth, and his eyes were 
briefly occluded by the fireflight on the lenses of his glasses. They turned white and blind again. 
"Grindelwald didn't like that at all. He got angry. He told me what a stupid little boy I was, trying 
to stand in the way of him and my brilliant brother ... Didn't I understand, my poor sister wouldn't 
have to be hidden once they'd changed the world, and led the wizards out of hiding, and taught the 
Muggles their place? 

"And there was an argument ... and I pulled my wand, and he pulled out his, and I had the 
Cruciatus Curse used on me by my brother's best friend -and Albus was trying to stop him, and 
then all three of us were dueling, and the flashing lights and the bangs set her off, she couldn't

stand it -" 

The color was draining from Aberforth's face as though he had suffered a mortal wound. 

"-and I think she wanted to help, but she didn't really know what she was doing, and I don't 

know which of us did it, it could have been any of us - and she was dead." 

His voice broke on the last word and he dropped down into the nearest chair. Hermione's face 
was wet with tears, and Ron was almost as pale as Aberforth. Harry felt nothing but revulsion, He 
wished he had not heard it, wished he could wash his mind clean of it. 

"I'm so ... I'm so sorry," Hermione whispered. 

"Gone," croaked Aberforth. "Gone forever." 

He wiped his nose on his cuff and cleared his throat. 

"'Course, Grindelwald scarpered. He had a bit of a track record already, back in his own 
country, and he didn't want Ariana set to his account too. And Albus was free, wasn't he? Free of 

the burden of his sister, free to become the greatest wizard of the -" 

"He was never free," said Harry. 

"I beg your pardon?" said Aberforth. 

"Never," said Harry. "The night that your brother died, he drank a potion that drove him out of 
his mind. He started screaming, pleading with someone who wasn't there. 'Don't hurt them, 
please ... hurt me instead.'" 

Ron and Hermione were staring at Harry. He had never gone into details about what had 
happened on the island on the lake. 

The events that had taken place after he and Dumbledore had returned to Hogwarts had eclipsed 
it so thoroughly. 

"He thought he was back there with you and Grindelwald, I know he did," said Harry, 
remembering Dumbledore whispering, pleading. 

"He thought he was watching Grindelwald hurting you and Ariana ... It was torture to him, if 
you'd seen him then, you wouldn't say he was free." 

Aberforth seemed lost in contemplation of his own knotted and veined hands. After a long pause 
he said. "How can you be sure, Potter, that my brother wasn't more interested in the greater good 
than in you? How can you be sure you aren't dispensable, just like my little sister?" 

A shard of ice seemed to pierce Harry's heart.

��408ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I don't believe it. Dumbledore loved Harry," said Hermione. 

"Why didn't he tell him to hide, then?" shot back Aberforth. "Why didn't he say to him, 'Take 
care of yourself, here's how to survive'?" 

"Because," said Harry before Hermione could answer, "sometimes you've got to think about 
more than your own safety! Sometimes you've got to think about the greater good! This is war!" 

"You're seventeen, boy!" 

"I'm of age, and I'm going to keep fighting even if you've given up!" 

"Who says I've given up?" 

"The Order of the Phoenix is finished," Harry repeated, "You-Know-Who's won, it's over, and 

anyone who's pretending different's kidding themselves." 

"I don't say I like it, but it's the truth!" 

"No, it isn't." said Harry. "Your brother knew how to finish You-Know-Who and he passed the 

knowledge on to me. I'm going to keep going until I succeed -or I die. Don't think I don't know 

how this might end. I've known it for years." 

He waited for Aberforth to jeer or to argue, but he did not. He merely scowled. 

"We need to get into Hogwarts," said Harry again. "If you can't help us, we'll wait till daybreak, 
leave you in peace, and try to find a way in ourselves. If you can help us -well, now would be a 
great time to mention it." 

Aberforth remained fixed in his chair, gazing at Harry with the eyes that were so extraordinarily 
like his brother's. At last he cleared his throat, got to his feet, walked around the little table, and 
approached the portrait of Ariana. 

"You know what to do," he said. 

She smiled, turned, and walked away, not as people in portraits usually did, out of the sides of 
their frames, but along what seemed to be a long tunnel painted behind her. They watched her 
slight figure retreating until finally she was swallowed by the darkness. 

"Er - what - ?" began Ron. 

"There's only one way in now," said Aberforth. "You must know they've got all the old secret 
passageways covered at both ends, dementors all around the boundary walls, regular patrols inside 
the school from what my sources tell me. The place has never been so heavily guarded. How you 
expect to do anything once you get inside it, with Snape in charge and the Carrows as his

deputies... well, that's your lookoutǰ;, isn't it? You say you're prepared to die." 

"But what ...?" said Hermione, frowning at Ariana's picture. 

A tiny white dot reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back 
toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, 
someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than 
Harry had ever seen. He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were 
ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled 
the portrait. 

Then the whole thing swang forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real 
tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the 
real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece and yelled. 

"I knew you'd come! I knew it, Harry!"

Chapter Twenty-Nine 

The Lost Diadem 

��Neville - what the - how - ?�� 
But Neville had spotted Ron and 



Hermione, 
and with yells of delight was hugging them 

too. The 
longer Harry looked at Neville, the worse he 

appeared. 
One of his eyes was swollen yellow and 

purple, there 
were gouge marks on his face, and his general 

air of 
unkemptness suggested that he had been living rough. Nevertheless, his battered visage shone with 
happiness as he let go of Hermione and said again, ��I knew you��d come! Kept telling Seamus it 
was a matter of time!��

 ��Neville, what��s happened to you?�� 

��What? This?�� Neville dismissed his injuries with a shake of the head. ��This is nothing, 
Seamus is worse. You��ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh,�� he turned to Aberforth, ��Ab, there 
might be a couple more people on the way.�� 

��Couple more?�� repeated Aberforth ominously. ��What d��you mean, a couple more, 
Longbottom? There��s a curfew and a Camwaulding Charm on the whole village!�� 

��I know, that��s why they��ll be Apparating directly into the bar,�� said Neville. ��Just send them 
down the passage when they get here, will you? Thanks a lot.�� 

Neville held out his hand to Hermione and helped her to climb up onto the mantelpiece and into 
the tunnel; Ron followed, then Neville. Harry addressed Aberforth.

 ��I don��t know how to thank you. You��ve saved our lives twice.��

 ��Look after 'em, then,�� said Aberforth gruffly. ��I might not be able to save 'em a third time.�� 

Harry chambered up onto the mantelpiece and through the hole behind Ariana��s portrait. There 
were smooth stone steps on the other side. It looked as though the passageway had been there for 
years. Brass lamps hung from the walls and the earthy floor was worn and smooth; as they walked, 
their shadows rippled, fanlike, across the wall. 

��How long��s this been here?�� Ron asked as they set off. ��It isn��t on the Marauder��s Map, is it 
Harry? I thought there were only seven passages in and out of school?��

��411ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��They sealed off all of those before the start of the year,�� said Neville. ��There��s no chance of 
getting through any of them now, not with the curses over the entrances and Death Eaters and 
dementors waiting at the exits.�� He started walking backward, beaming, drinking them in. ��Never 
mind that stuff ... Is it true? Did you break into Gringotts? Did you escape on a dragon? It��s 
everywhere, everyone��s talking about it. Terry Boot got beaten up by Carrow for yelling about it in 
the Great Hall at dinner!��

 ��Yeah, it��s true,�� said Harry.

 Neville laughed gleefully. ��What did you do with the dragon?��

 ��Released it into the wild,�� said Ron. ��Hermione was all for keeping it as a pet.��

 ��Don��t exaggerate, Ron �C�� 

��But what have you been doing? People have been saying you��ve just been on the run, Harry, 
but I don��t think so. I think you��ve been up to something.��

 ��You��re right,�� said Harry, ��but tell us about Hogwarts, Neville, we haven��t heard anything.�� 

��It��s been, well, it��s not really like Hogwarts anymore,�� said Neville, the smile fading from his 

face as he spoke. ��Do you know about the Carrows?��

 ��Those two Death Eaters who teach here?�� 

��They do more than teach,�� said Neville. ��They��re in charge of all discipline. They like 

punishment, the Carrows.��

 ��Like Umbridge?�� 

��Nah, they make her look tame. The other teachers are all supposed to refer us to the Carrows if 
we do anything wrong. They don��t, though, if they can avoid it. You can tell they all hate them as 
much as we do.�� 

��Amycus, the bloke, he teaches what used to be Defense Against the Dark Arts, except now it��s 
just the Dark Arts. We��re supposed to practice the Cruciatus Curse on people who��ve earned 
detentions �C��

 ��What?��

 Harry, Ron, and Hermione��s united voices echoed up and down the passage. 

��Yeah,�� said Neville. ��That��s how I got this one,�� he pointed at a particularly deep gash in his 
cheek, ��I refused to do it. Some people are into it, though; Crabbe and Goyle love it. First time 
they��ve ever been top in anything, I expect.��

��412ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Alecto, Amycus��s sister, teaches Muggle Studies, which is compulsory for everyone. We��ve 
all got to listen to her explain how Muggles are like animals, stupid and dirty, and how they drive 
wizards into hiding by being vicious toward them, and how the natural order is being reestablished. 
I got this one,�� he indicated another slash to his face, ��for asking her how much Muggle blood she 
and her brother have got.��

 ��Blimey, Neville,�� said Ron, ��there��s a time and a place for getting a smart mouth.�� 

��You didn��t see her,�� said Neville. ��You wouldn��t have stood it either. The thing is, it helps 
when people stand up to them, it gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when you did it, 
Harry.�� 

��But they��ve used you as a knife sharpener,�� said Ron, winding slightly as they passed a lamp 
and Neville��s injuries were thrown into even greater relief. 

Neville shrugged. ��Doesn��t matter. They don��t want to spill too much pure blood, so they��ll 
torture us a bit if we��re mouthy but they won��t actually kill us.�� 

Harry did not know what was worse, the things that Neville was saying or the matter-of-fact 
tone in which he said them. 

��The only people in real danger are the ones whose friends and relatives on the outside are 
giving trouble. They get taken hostage. Old Xeno Lovegood was getting a bit too outspoken in The 
Quibbler, so they dragged Luna off the train on the way back for Christmas.��

 ��Neville, she��s all right, we��ve seen her �C��

 ��Yeah, I know, she managed to get a message to me.�� 

From his pocket he pulled a golden coin, and Harry recognized it as one of the fake Galleons 
that Dumbledore��s Army had used to send one another messages. 

��These have been great,�� said Neville, beaming at Hermione. ��The Carrows never rumbled 
(Slang) understand, discover) how we were communicating, it drove them mad. We used to sneak 
out at night and put graffiti on the walls, Dumbledore��s Army, Still Recruiting, stuff like that. 
Snape hated it.��

 ��You used to?�� said Harry, who had noticed the past tense. 

��Well, it got more difficult as time went on,�� said Neville. ��We lost Luna at Christmas, and 
Ginny never came back after Easter, and the three of us were sort of the leaders. The Carrows 
seemed to know I was behind a lot of it, so they started coming down on me hard, and then

Michael Corner went and got caught releasing a first-year they��d chained up, and they tortured him 

pretty badly. That scared people off.��

 ��No kidding,�� muttered Ron, as the passage began to slope upward. 

��Yeah, well, I couldn��t ask people to go through what Michael did, so we dropped those kinds 

of stunts. But we were still fighting, doing underground stuff, right up until a couple of weeks ago. 

That��s when they decided there was only one way to stop me, I suppose, and they went for Gran.��

 ��They what?�� said Harry, Ron, and Hermione together. 

��Yeah,�� said Neville, panting a little now, because the passage was climbing so steeply, ��well, 
you can see their thinking. It had worked really well, kidnapping kids to force their relatives to 
behave. I s��pose it was only a matter of time before they did it the other way around. Thing was,�� 
he faced them, and Harry was astonished to see that he was grinning, ��they bit off a bit more than 
they could chew with Gran. Little old witch living alone, they probably thought they didn��t need to 
send anyone particularly powerful. Anyway,�� Neville laughed, ��Dawlish is still in St. Mungo��s and 
Gran��s on the run. She sent me a letter,�� he clapped a hand to the breast pocket of his robes, 
��telling me she was proud of me, that I��m my parent��s son, and to keep it up.��

 ��Cool,�� said Ron. 

��Yea,�� said Neville happily. ��Only thing was, once they realized they had no hold over me, 
they decided Hogwarts could do without me after all. I don��t know whether they were planning to 
kill me or send me to Azkaban, either way, I knew it was time to disappear.�� 

��But,�� said Ron, looking thoroughly confused, ��aren��t �C aren��t we heading straight back for 

Hogwarts?��

 ��'Course,�� said Neville. ��You��ll see. We��re here.�� 

They turned a corner and there ahead of them was the end of the passage. Another short flight 

of steps led to a door just like the one hidden behind Ariana��s portrait. Neville pushed it open and 

climbed through. As Harry followed, he heard Neville call out for unseen people, 

 ��Look who it is! Didn��t I tell you?�� 

As Harry emerged into the room behind the passage, there were several screams and yells, 
��HARRY!�� ��It��s Potter, it��s POTTER!�� ��Ron!�� ��Hermione!�� 

He had a confused impression of colored hangings, of lamps and many faces. The next moment 
he, Ron and Hermione were engulfed, hugged, pounded on the back, their hair ruffled, their hands

��414ҳ��

shaken, by what seemed to be more than twenty people. They might have just won a Quidditch 
final. 

��Okay, okay, calm down!�� Neville called, and as the crowd backed away, Harry was able to 
take in their surroundings. 

He did not recognize the dorm at all. It was enormous, and looked rather like the interior of a 
particularly sumptuous tree house, or perhaps a gigantic ship��s cabin. Multicolored hammocks 
were strung from the ceiling and from the balcony that ran around the dark wood-paneled and 
windowless walls, which were covered in bright tapestry hangings. Harry saw the gold Gryffindor 
lion, emblazoned on scarlet; the black badger of Hufflepuff, set against yellow; and the bronze 
eagle of Ravenclaw, on blue. The silver and green of Slytherin alone were absent. There were 
bulging bookcases, a few broomsticks propped against the walls, and in the corner, a large wood-
cased wireless. 

 ��Where are we?��

 ��Room of Requirement, of course!�� said Neville. ��Surpassed itself, hasn��t it? The Carrows were 
chasing me, and I knew I had just one chance for a hideout, I managed to get through the door and 
this is what I found! Well, it wasn��t exactly like this when I arrived, it was a load smaller, there 
was only one hammock and just Gryffindor hangings. But it��s expanded as more and more of the 

D.A. have arrived.�� 
��And the Carrows can��t get in?�� asked Harry, looking around for the door. 
��No,�� said Seamus Finnigan, whom Harry had not recognized until he spoke, Seamus��s face 
was bruised and puffy. ��It��s a proper hideout, as long as one of us stays in here, they can��t get at 
us, the door won��t open. It��s all down to Neville. He really gets this room. You��ve got to ask for 
exactly what you need �C like, 'I don��t want any Carrow supporters to be able to get in' �C and it��ll 
do it for you! You��ve just got to make sure you close the loopholes. Neville��s the man!�� 

��It��s quite straightforward, really,�� said Neville modestly. ��I��d been in here about a day and a 
half, and getting really hungry, and wishing I could get something to eat, and that��s when the 
passage to Hog��s Head opened up. I went through it and met Aberforth. He��s been providing us 
with food, because for some reason, that��s the one thing the room doesn��t really do.�� 

��Yeah, well, food��s one of the five exceptions to Gamp��s Law of Elemental Transfiguration,�� 
said Ron to general astonishment.

��415ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��So we��ve been hiding out here for nearly two weeks,�� said Seamus, ��and it just makes more 
hammocks every time we need room, and it even sprouted a pretty good bathroom once girls 
started turning up �C�� 

��-and thought they��d quite like to wash, yes,�� supplied Lavender Brown, whom Harry had not 
noticed until that point. Now that he looked around properly, he recognized many familiar faces. 
Both Patil twins were there, as were Terry Boot, Ernie Macmillan, Anthony Goldstein, and 
Michael Corner. 

��Tell us what you��ve been up to, though,�� said Ernie. ��There��ve been so many rumors, we��ve 
been trying to keep up with you on Potterwatch.�� He pointed at the wireless. ��You didn��t break 
into Gringotts?��

 ��They did!�� said Neville. ��And the dragon��s true too!��

 There was a smattering (bit) of applause and a few whoops; Ron took a bow. 

 ��What were you after?�� asked Seamus eagerly. 

Before any of them could parry����,�ܿ� the question with one of their own, Harry felt a 
terrible, scorching pain in the lightning scar. As he turned his back hastily on the curious and 
delighted faces, the Room of Requirement vanished, and he was standing inside a ruined stone 
shack, and the rotting floorboards were ripped apart at his feet, a disinterred (exhume, unearth) 
golden box lay open and empty beside the hole, and Voldemort��s scream of fury vibrated inside his 
head. 

With an enormous effort he pulled out of Voldemort��s mind again, back to where he stood, 
swaying, in the Room of Requirement, sweat pouring from his face and Ron holding him up. 

��Are you all right, Harry?�� Neville was saying. ��What to sit down? I expect you��re tired, aren��t 
-?�� 

��No,�� said Harry. He looked at Ron and Hermione, trying to tell them without words that 
Voldemort had just discovered the loss of one of the other Horcruxes. Time was running out fast. 
If Voldemort chose to visit Hogwarts next, they would miss their chance.

 ��We need to get going,�� he said, and their expressions told him that they understood.

 ��What are we going to do, then, Harry?�� asked Seamus. ��What��s the plan?�� 

��Plan?�� repeated Harry. He was exercising all his willpower to prevent himself succumbing 
again to Voldemort��s rage. His scar was still burning. ��Well, there��s something we �C Ron,

��416ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hermione, and I �C need to do, and then we��ll get out of here.�� 

Nobody was laughing or whooping anymore. Neville looked confused. ��What d��you mean, 'get 
out of here'?�� 

��We haven��t come back to stay,�� said Harry, rubbing his scar, trying to soothe the pain. 
��There��s something important we need to do �C��

 ��What is it?��

 ��I �C I can��t tell you.�� 

There was a ripple of muttering at this, Neville��s brows contracted. ��Why can��t you tell us? It��s 

something to do with fighting You-Know-Who, right?��

 ��Well, yeah �C��

 ��Then we��ll help you.�� 

The other members of Dumbledore��s Army were nodding, some enthusiastically, others 
solemnly. A couple of them rose from their chairs to demonstrate their willingness for immediate 
action. 

��You don��t understand,�� Harry seemed to have said that a lot in the last few hours. ��We �C we 

can��t tell you. We��ve got to do it �C alone.��

 ��Why?�� asked Neville. 

��Because...�� In his desperation to start looking for the missing Horcrux, or at least have a 
private discussion with Ron and Hermione about where they might commence their search, Harry 
found it difficult to gather his thoughts. His scar was still searing. ��Dumbledore left the three of us 
a job,�� he said carefully, ��and we weren��t supposed to tell �C I mean, he wanted us to do it, just the 
three of us.�� 

��We��re his army,�� said Neville. ��Dumbledore��s Army. We were all in it together, we��ve been 

keeping it going while you three have been off on your own �C��

 ��It hasn��t exactly been a picnic, mate,�� said Ron. 

��I never said it had, but I don��t see why you can��t trust us. Everyone in this room��s been 
fighting and they��ve been driven in here because the Carrows were hunting them down. Everyone 
in here��s proven they��re loyal to Dumbledore �C loyal to you.�� 

��Look,�� Harry began, without knowing what he was going to say, but it did not matter. The 
tunnel door had just opened behind him.

��We got your message, Neville! Hello you three, I thought you must be here!��

 It was Luna and Dean. Seamus gave a great roar of delight and ran to hug his best friend. 

 ��Hi, everyone!�� said Luna happily. ��Oh, it��s great to be back!��

 ��Luna,�� said Harry distractedly, ��what are you doing here? How did you -?�� 

��I sent for her,�� said Neville, holding up the fake Galleon. ��I promised her and Ginny that if 
you turned up I��d let them know. We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. 
That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.��

 ��Of course that��s what it means,�� said Luna brightly. ��Isn��t it, Harry? We��re going to fight them 
out of Hogwarts?�� 

��Listen,�� said Harry with a rising sense of panic, ��I��m sorry, but that��s not what we came back 
for. There��s something we��ve got to do, and then �C��

 ��You��re going to leave us in this mess?�� demanded Michael Corner. 

��No!�� said Ron. ��What we��re doing will benefit everyone in the end, it��s all about trying to get 

rid of You-Know-Who �C��

 ��Then let us help!�� said Neville angrily. ��We want to be a part of it!�� 

There was another noise behind them, and Harry turned. His heart seemed to fall. Ginny was 
now climbing through the hole in the wall, closely followed by Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. 
Ginny gave Harry a radiant smile. He had forgotten, he had never fully appreciated, how beautiful 
she was, but he had never been less pleased to see her. 

��Aberforth��s getting a bit annoyed,�� said Fred, raising his hand in answer to several cries of 
greeting. ��He wants a kip, and his bar��s turned into a railway station.�� 

Harry��s mouth fell open. Right behind Lee Jordan came Harry��s old girlfriend, Cho Chang. She 
smiled at him. 

��I got the message,�� she said, holding up her own fake Galleon and she walked over to sit 
beside Michael Corner. 

 ��So what��s the plan, Harry?�� said George. 

��There isn��t one,�� said Harry, still disoriented by the sudden appearance of all these people, 

unable to take everything in while his scar was still burning so fiercely.

 ��Just going to make it up as we go along, are we? My favorite kind,�� said Fred. 

��You��ve got to stop this!�� Harry told Neville. ��What did you call them all back for? This is

insane �C�� 

��We��re fighting, aren��t we?�� said Dean, taking out his fake Galleon. ��The message said Harry 
was back, and we were going to fight! I��ll have to get a wand, though �C��

 ��You haven��t got a wand -?�� began Seamus.

 Ron turned suddenly to Harry. ��Why can��t they help?��

 ��What?�� 

��They can help.�� He dropped his voice and said, so that none of them could hear but Hermione, 
who stood between them, ��We don��t know where it is. We��ve got to find it fast. We don��t have to 
tell them it��s a Horcrux.�� 

Harry looked from Ron to Hermione, who murmured, ��I think Ron��s right. We don��t even 
know what we��re looking for, we need them.�� And when Harry looked unconvinced, ��You don��t 
have to do everything alone, Harry.�� 

Harry thought fast, his scar still prickling, his head threatening to split again. Dumbledore had 
warned him against telling anyone but Ron and Hermione about the Horcruxes. Secrets and lies, 
that��s how we grew up, and Albus ... he was a natural ... Was he turning into Dumbledore, keeping 
his secrets clutched to his chest, afraid to trust? But Dumbledore had trusted Snape, and where had 
that led? To murder at the top of the highest tower ... 

 ��All right,�� he said quietly to the other two. ��Okay,�� he called to the room at large, and all noise 
ceased, Fred and George, who had been cracking jokes (make jokes, tell funny stories) for the 
benefit of those nearest, fell silent, and all of the looked alert, excited. 

��There��s something we need to find,�� Harry said. ��Something �C something that��ll help us 
overthrow You-Know-Who. It��s here at Hogwarts, but we don��t know where. It might have 
belonged to Ravenclaw. Has anyone heard of an object like that? Has anyone come across 
something with her eagle on it, for instance?�� 

He looked hopefully toward the little group of Ravenclaws, to Padma, Michael, Terry, and Cho, 
but it was Luna who answered, perched on the arm of Ginny��s chair. 

��Well, there��s her lost diadem. I told you about it, remember, Harry? The lost diadem of 
Ravenclaw? Daddy��s trying to duplicate it.�� 

��Yeah, but the lost diadem,�� said Michael Corner, rolling his eyes, ��is lost, Luna. That��s sort of 
the point.��

��419ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��When was it lost?�� asked Harry. 

��Centuries ago, they say,�� said Cho, and Harry��s heart sank. ��Professor Flitwick says the 
diadem vanished with Ravenclaw herself. People have looked, but,�� she appealed to her fellow 
Ravenclaws. ��Nobody��s ever found a trace of it, have they?��

 They all shook their heads. 

 ��Sorry, but what is a diadem?�� asked Ron. 

��It��s a kind of crown,�� said Terry Boot. ��Ravenclaw��s was supposed to have magical 
properties, enhance the wisdom of the wearer.��

 ��Yes, Daddy��s Wrackspurt siphons �C��

 But Harry cut across Luna. ��And none of you have ever seen anything that looks like it?�� 

They all shook their heads again. Harry looked at Ron and Hermione and his own 
disappointment was mirrored back at him. 

An object that had been lost this long, and apparently without trace, did not seem like a good 
candidate for the Horcrux hidden in the castle ... Before he could formulate a new question, 
however, Cho spoke again. 

��If you��d like to see what the diadem��s supposed to look like, I could take you up to our 
common room and show you, Harry. Ravenclaw��s wearing it in her statue.�� 

Harry��s scar scorched again. For a moment the Room of Requirement swam before him, and he 
saw instead the dark earth soaring beneath him and felt the great snake wrapped around his 
shoulders. Voldemort was flying again, whether to the underground lake or here, to the castle, he 
did not know. Either way, there was hardly any time left. 

��He��s on the move,�� he said quietly to Ron and Hermione. He glanced at Cho and then back at 
them. ��Listen, I know it��s not much of a lead, but I��m going to go look at this statue, at least find 
out what the diadem looks like. Wait for me here and keep, you know �C the other one �C safe.�� 

Cho had got to her feet, but Ginny said rather fiercely, ��No, Luna will take Harry, won��t you, 

Luna?��

 ��Oooh, yes, I��d like to,�� said Luna happily, as Cho sat down again, looking disappointed.

 ��How do we get out?�� Harry asked Neville.

 ��Over here.�� 

He led Harry and Luna to a corner, where a small cupboard opened onto a steep staircase. ��It

��420ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

comes out somewhere different every day, so they��ve never been able to find it,�� he said. ��Only 
trouble is, we never know exactly where we��re going to end up when we go out. Be careful, Harry, 
they��re always patrolling the corridors at night.��

 ��No problem,�� said Harry. ��See you in a bit.�� 

He and Luna hurried up the staircase, which was long, lit by torches, and turned corners in 
unexpected places. At last they reached what appeared to be solid wall. 

��Get under here,�� Harry told Luna, pulling out the Invisibility Cloak and throwing it over both 
of them. He gave the wall a little push. 

It melted away at his touch and they slipped outside. Harry glanced back and saw that it had 
resealed itself at once. They were standing in a dark corridor. Harry pulled Luna back into the 
shadows, fumbled in the pouch around his neck, and took out the Marauder��s Map. Holding it 
close to his nose he searched, and located his and Luna��s dots at last. 

��We��re up on the fifth floor,�� he whispered, watching Filch moving away from them, a corridor 

ahead. ��Come on, this way.��

 They crept off. 

Harry had prowled the castle at night many times before, but never had his heart hammered that 
fast, never had so much depended on his safe passage through the place. Through squares of 
moonlight upon the floor, past suits of armor whose helmets creaked at the sound of their soft 
footsteps, around corners beyond which who knew what lurked. Harry and Luna walked, checking 
the Marauder��s Map whenever light permitted, twice pausing to allow a ghost to pass without 
drawing attention to themselves. He expected to encounter an obstacle at any moment; his worst 
fear was Peeves, and he strained his ears with every step to hear the first, telltale signs of the 
poltergeist��s approach. 

��This way, Harry,�� breathed Luna, plucking his sleeve and pulling him toward a spiral 
staircase. 

They climbed in tight, dizzying circles; Harry had never been up here before. At last they 
reached a door. There was no handle and no keyhole, nothing but a plain expanse of aged wood, 
and a bronze knocker in the shape an eagle. 

Luna reached out a pale hand, which looked eerie floating in midair, unconnected to arm or 
body. She knocked once, and in the silence it sounded to Harry like a cannon blast. At once the

��421ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

beak of the eagle opened, but instead of a bird��s called, a soft, musical voice said, ��Which came 

first, the phoenix or the flame?��

 ��Hmm ... What do you think, Harry?�� said Luna, looking thoughtful.

 ��What? Isn��t there a password?��

 ��Oh no, you��ve got to answer a question,�� said Luna.

 ��What if you get it wrong?�� 

��Well, you have to wait for somebody who gets it right,�� said Luna. ��That way you learn, you 

see?��

 ��Yeah ... Trouble is, we can��t really afford to wait for anyone else, Luna.�� 

��No, I see what you mean,�� said Luna seriously. ��Well then, I think the answer is that a circle 

has no beginning.��

 ��Well reasoned,�� said the voice, and the door swung open. 

The deserted Ravenclaw common room was a wide, circular room, airier than any Harry had 
ever seen at Hogwarts. Graceful arched windows punctuated the walls, which were hung with 
blue-and-bronze silks. By day, the Ravenclaws would have a spectacular view of the surrounding 
mountains. The ceiling was domed and painted with stars, which were echoed in the midnight-blue 
carpet. There were tables, chairs, and bookcases, and in a niche opposite the door stood a tall statue 
of white marble. 

Harry recognized Rowena Ravenclaw from the bust he had seen at Luna��s house. The statue 
stood beside a door that led, he guessed, to dormitories above. He strode right up to the marble 
woman, and she seemed to look back at him with a quizzical half smile on her face, beautiful yet 
slightly intimidating. A delicate-looking circlet had been reproduced in marble on top of her head. 
It was not unlike the tiara Fleur had worn at her wedding. There were tiny words etched into it. 
Harry stepped out from under the Cloak and climbed up onto Ravenclaw��s plinth to read them.

 ����Wit beyond measure is man��s greatest treasure.����

 ��Which makes you pretty skin, witless,�� said a cackling voice. 

Harry whirled around, slipped off the plinth, and landed on the floor. The sloping-shouldered 
figure of Alecto Carrow was standing before him, and even as Harry raised his wand, she pressed a 
stubby forefinger to the skull and snake branded on her forearm.

Chapter Thirty 
The Sacking of Severus Snape 


The moment her finger touched the Mark, Harry's 


scar burned 
savagely, the starry room vanished from sight, and 

he was 
standing upon an outcrop of rock beneath a cliff, 

and the sea 
was washing around him and there was a triumph in 

his heart �C 
They have the boy. 
A loud bang brought Harry back to where he 

stood. 
Disoriented, he raised his wand, but the witch 

before him 
was already falling forward; she hit the ground so hard that the glass in the bookcases tinkled. 
��I've never Stunned anyone except in our D.A. lessons,�� said Luna, sounding mildly interested. 
��That was noisier than I though it would be.�� 

And sure enough, the ceiling had begun to tremble. Scurrying, echoing footsteps were growing 
louder from behind the door leading to the dormitories. Luna's spell had woken Ravenclaws 
sleeping above.

 ��Luna, where are you? I need to get under the Cloak!�� 

Luna's feet appeared out of nowhere, he hurried to her side and she let the Cloak fall back over 
them as the door opened and a stream of Ravenclaws, all in their nightclothes, flooded into the 
common room. There were gasps and cries of surprise as they saw Alecto lying there unconscious. 
Slowly they shuffled in around her, a savage beast that might wake at any moment and attack 
them. Then one brave little first-year darted up to her and prodded her backside with his big toe. 

 ��I think she might be dead!�� he shouted with delight. 

��Oh look,�� whispered Luna happily, as the Ravenclaws crowded in around Alecto. ��They're 
pleased!��

 ��Yeah... great... �� 

Harry closed his eyes, and as his scar throbbed he chose to sink again into Voldemort's mind. 
He was moving along the tunnel into the first cave. He had chosen to make sure of the locker 
before coming... but that would not take him long. 

There was a rap on the common room door and every Ravenclaw froze. From the other side,

��423ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Harry heard the soft, musical voice that issued from the eagle door knocker, ��Where do Vanished 
objects go?�� 

��I dunno, do I? Shut it!�� snarled an uncouth voice that Harry knew was that of the Carrow 
brother, Amycus, ��Alecto? Alecto? Are you there? Have you got him? Open the door!�� 

The Ravenclaws were whispering amongst themselves, terrified. Then without warning, there 
came a series of loud bangs, as though somebody was firing a gun into the door. 

��ALECTO! If he comes, and we haven't got Potter -d'you want to go the same way as the 
Malfoys? ANSWER ME!�� Amycus bellowed, shaking the door for all he was worth, but still it did 
not open. The Ravenclaws were all backing away, and some of the most frightened began 
scampering back up the staircase to their beds. Then, just as Harry was wondering whether he 
ought not to blast open the door and Stun Amycus before the Death Eater could do anything else, a 
second, most familiar voice rang out beyond the door. 

 ��May I ask what you are doing, Professor Carrow?��

 ��Trying - to get - through this damned - door!�� shouted Amycus. ��Go and get Flitwick! Get him 
to open it, now!�� 

��But isn't your sister in there�� asked Professor McGonagall. ��Didn't Professor Flitwick let her 
in earlier this evening, at your urgent request? Perhaps she could open the door for you? Then you 
needn't wake up half the castle.��

 ��She ain't answering, you old besomɨ��! You open it! Darn! Do it, now!�� 

��Certainly, if you wish it,�� said Professor McGonagall, with awful coldness. There was a 
genteel tap of the knocker and the musical voice asked again.

 ��Where do Vanished objects go?��

 ��Into nonbeing, which is to say, everything,�� replied Professor McGonagall.

 ��Nicely phrased,�� replied the eagle door knocker, and the door swung open. 

The few Ravenclaws who had remained behind sprinted for the stairs as Amycus burst over the 
threshold, brandishing his wand. Hunched like his sister, he had a pallid, doughy face and tiny 
eyes, which fell at once on Alecto, sprawled motionless on the floor. He let out a yell of fury and 
fear. 

��What've they done, the little whelps���� 
?�� he screamed. ��I'll Cruciate the lot of 'em till they 
tell me who did it -and what's the Dark Lord going to say?�� he shrieked, standing over his sister

��424ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and smacking himself on the forehead with his fist, ��We haven't got him, and they've gone and 
killed her!�� 

��She's only Stunned,�� said Professor McGonagall impatiently, who had stooped down to 
examine Alecto. ��She'll be perfectly all right.�� 

��No she bludgering well won't!�� bellowed Amycus. ��Not after the Dark Lord gets hold of her! 
She's gone and sent for him, I felt me Mark burn, and he thinks we've got Potter!��

 ��'Got Potter'?�� said Professor McGonagall sharply, ��What do you mean, 'got Potter'?�� 

��He told us Potter might try and get inside Ravenclaw Tower, and to send for him if we caught 

him!��

 ��Why would Harry Potter try to get inside Ravenclaw Tower? Potter belongs in my House!�� 

Beneath the disbelief and anger, Harry heard a little strain of pride in her voice, and affection 

for Minerva McGonagall gushed up inside him.

 ��We was told he might come in here!�� said Carrow. ��I dunno why, do I?�� 

Professor McGonagall stood up and her beady eyes swept the room. Twice they passed right 

over the place where Harry and Luna stood. 

��We can push it off on the kids,�� said Amycus, his pig like face suddenly crafty. ��Yeah, that's 
what we'll do. We'll say Alecto was ambushed by the kids, them kids up there�� -he looked up at 
the starry ceiling toward the dormitories -��and we'll say they forced her to press her Mark, and 
that's why he got a false alarm. He can punish them. Couple of kids more or less, what's the 
difference?�� 

��Only the difference between truth and lied, courage and cowardice,�� said Professor 
McGonagall, who had turned pale, ��a difference, in short, which you and your sister seem unable 
to appreciate. But let me make one thing very clear. You are not going to pass off your many 
ineptitudes on the students of Hogwarts. I shall not permit it.��

 ��Excuse me?�� 

Amycus moved forward until he was offensively close to Professor McGonagall, his face 
within inches of hers. She refused to back away, but looked down at him as if he were something 
disgusting she had found stuck to the lavatory seat. 

��It's not a case of what you'll permit, Minerva McGonagall. Your time's over. It's us what's in 
charge here now, and you'll back me up or you'll pay the price.��

��425ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

And he spat in her face.

 Harry pulled the Cloak off himself, raised his wand, and said, ��You shouldn't have done that.��

 As Amycus spun around, Harry shouted, ��Crucio!�� 

The Death Eater was lifted off his feet. He writhed through the air like a drowning man, 
thrashing and howling in pain, and then, with a crunch and a shattering of glass, he smashed into 
the front of a bookcase and crumpled, insensible, to the floor. 

��I see what Bellatrix meant,�� said Harry, the blood thundering through his brain, ��you need to 
really mean it.�� 

��Potter!�� whispered Professor McGonagall, clutching her heart. ��Potter-you're here! What -? 
How -?�� She struggled to pull herself together. ��Potter, that was foolish!��

 ��He spat at you,�� said Harry.

 ��Potter, I - that was very - gallant of you - but don't you realize -?�� 

��Yeah, I do,�� Harry assured her. Somehow her panic steadied him. ��Professor McGonagall, 

Voldemort's on the way.�� 

��Oh, are we allowed to say the name now?�� asked Luna with an air of interest, pulling off the 
Invisibility Cloak. The appearance of a second outlaw seemed to overwhelm Professor 
McGonagall, who staggered backward and fell into a nearby chair, clutching at the neck of her old 
tartan dressing gown. 

��I don't think it makes any difference what we call him,�� Harry told Luna. ��He already knows 
where I am.�� 

In a distant part of Harry's brain, that part connected to the angry, burning scar, he could see 
Voldemort sailing fast over the dark lake in the ghostly green boat. He had nearly reached the 
island where the stone basin stood. 

 ��You must flee,�� whispered Professor McGonagall, ��Now Potter, as quickly as you can!�� 

��I can't,�� said Harry, ��There's something I need to do. Professor, do you know where the 
diadem of Ravenclaw is?�� 

��The d-diadem of Ravenclaw? Of course not -hasn't it been lost for centuries?�� She sat up a 
little straighter. ��Potter, it was madness, utter madness, for you to enter this castle -�� 

��I had to,�� said Harry. ��Professor, there's something hidden here that I'm supposed to find, and 
it could be the diadem - if I could just speak to Professor Flitwick -��

��426ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

There was a sound of movement, of clinking glass. Amycus was coming round. Before Harry 
or Luna could act, Professor McGonagall rose to her feet, pointed her wand at the groggy Death 
Eater, and said, ��Imperio.�� 

Amycus got up, walked over to his sister, picked up her wand, then shuffled obediently to 
Professor McGonagall and handed it over along with his own. Then he lay down on the floor 
beside Alecto. 

Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and a length of shimmering silver rope appeared 
out of thin air and snaked around the Carrows, binding them tightly together. 

��Potter,�� said Professor McGonagall, turning to face him again with superb indifference to the 
Carrows' predicament. ��if He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named does indeed know that you are here -�� 

As she said it, a wrath that was like physical pain blazed through Harry, setting his scar on fire, 
and for a second he looked down upon a basin whose potion had turned clear, and saw that no 
golden locket lay safe beneath the surface. 

��Potter, are you all right.�� said a voice, and Harry came back. He was clutching Luna's shoulder 
to steady himself. 

��Time's running out, Voldemort's getting nearer, Professor, I'm acting on Dumbledore's orders, 
I must find what he wanted me to find! But we've got to get the students out while I'm searching 
the castle. It's me Voldemort wants, but he won't care about killing a few more or less, not now -�� 
not now he knows I'm attacking Horcruxes, Harry finished the sentence in his head. 

��You're acting on Dumbledore's orders?�� she repeated with a look of dawning wonder. Then 
she drew herself up to her fullest height. 

��We shall secure the school against He Who Must Not Be Named while you search for this this 
object.��

 ��Is that possible?�� 

��I think so,�� said Professor McGonagall dryly, ��we teachers are rather good at magic, you 

know. I am sure we will be able to hold him off for a while if we all put our best efforts into it. Of 

course, something will have to be done about Professor Snape -��

 ��Let me -�� 

��-and if Hogwarts is about to enter a state of siege, with the Dark Lord at the gates, it would 

indeed be advisable to take as many innocent people out of the way as possible. With the Floo

��427ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Network under observation, and Apparition impossible within the grounds -�� 

��There's a way,�� said Harry quickly, and he explained about the passageway leading into the 
Hog's Head. 

 ��Potter, we're talking about hundreds of students -�� 

��I know, Professor, but if Voldemort and the Death Eaters are concentrating on the school 

boundaries they won't be interested in anyone who's Disapparating out of Hog's Head.�� 

��There's something in that,�� she agreed. She pointed her wand at the Carrows, and a silver net 
fell upon their bound bodies, tied itself around them, and hoisted them into the air, where they 
dangled beneath the blue-and-gold ceiling like two large, ugly sea creatures. ��Come. We must alert 
the other Heads of House. You'd better put that Cloak back on.�� 

She marched toward the door, and as she did so she raised her wand. From the tip burst three 
silver cats with spectacle markings around their eyes. The Patronuses ran sleekly ahead, filling the 
spiral staircase with silvery light, as Professor McGonagall, Harry, and Luna hurried back down. 

Along the corridors they raced, and one by one the Patronuses left them. Professor 
McGonagall's tartan dressing gown rustled over the floor, and Harry and Luna jogged behind her 
under the Cloak. 

They had descended two more floors when another set of quiet footsteps joined theirs. Harry, 
whose scar was still prickling, heard them first. He felt in the pouch around his neck for the 
Marauder's Map, but before he could take it our, McGonagall too seemed to become aware of their 
company. She halted, raised her wand ready to duel, and said, ��Who's there?��

 ��It is I,�� said a low voice. 

 From behind a suit of armor stepped Severus Snape. 

Hatred boiled up in Harry at the sight of him. He had forgotten the details of Snape's 
appearance in the magnitude of his crimes, forgotten how his greasy black hair hung in curtains 
around his thin face, how his black eyes had a dead, cold look. He was not wearing nightclothes, 
but was dressed in his usual black cloak, and he too was holding his wand ready for a fight.

 ��Where are the Carrows?�� he asked quietly.

 ��Wherever you told them to be, I expect, Severus,�� said Professor McGonagall. 

Snape stepped nearer, and his eyes flitted over Professor McGonagall into the air around her, as 
if he knew that Harry was there. Harry held his wand up too, ready to attack.

��428ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I was under the impression,�� said Snape, ��That Alecto had apprehended an intruder.��

 ��Really?�� said Professor McGonagall. ��And what gave you that impression?�� 

Snape made a slight flexing movement of his left arm, where the Dark Mark was branded into 
his skin. 

��Oh, but naturally,�� said Professor McGonagall. ��You Death Eaters have your own private 
means of communication, I forgot.�� 

Snape pretended not to have heard her. His eyes were still probing the air all about her, and he 
was moving gradually closer, with an air of hardly noticing what he was doing.

 ��I did not know that it was your night to patrol the corridors Minerva.��

 ��You have some objection?��

 ��I wonder what could have brought you out of our bed at this late hour?��

 ��I thought I heard a disturbance,�� said Professor McGonagall.

 ��Really? But all seems calm.��

 Snape looked into her eyes.

 ��Have you seen Harry Potter, Minerva? Because if you have. I must insist -�� 

Professor McGonagall moved faster than Harry could have believed. Her wand slashed through 
the air and for a split second Harry thought that Snape must crumple, unconscious, but the 
swiftness of his Shield Charm was such that McGonagall was thrown off balance. She brandished 
her wand at a torch on the wall and it flew out of its bracket. Harry, about to curse Snape, was 
forced to pull Luna out of the way of the descending flames, which became a ring of fire that filled 
the corridor and flew like a lasso at Snape. 

Then it was no longer fire, but a great black serpent that McGonagall blasted to smoke, which 
re-formed and solidified in seconds to become a swarm of pursuing daggers. Snape avoided them 
only by forcing the suit of armor in front of him, and with echoing clangs the daggers sank, one 
after another, into its breast. 

��Minerva!�� said a squeaky voice, and looking behind him, still shielding Luna from flying 
spells, Harry saw Professors Flitwick and Sprout sprinting up the corridor toward them in their 
nightclothes, with the enormous Professor Slughorn panting along at the rear.

 ��No!�� squealed Flitwick, raising his wand. ��You'll do no more murder at Hogwarts!�� 

Flitwick's spell hit the suit of armor behind which Snape had taken shelter. With a clatter it

��429ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

came to life. 

Snape struggled free of the crushing arms and sent it flying back toward his attackers. 

Harry and Luna had to dive sideways to avoid it as it smashed into the wall and shattered. When 
Harry looked up again, Snape was in full flight, McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout all thundering 
after him. He hurtled through a classroom door and, moments later, he heard McGonagall cry, 
��Coward! COWARD!��

 ��What's happened, what's happened?�� asked Luna. 

Harry dragged her to her feet and they raced along the corridor, trailing the Invisibility Cloak 
behind them, into the deserted classroom where Professors McGonagall, Flitwick, and Sprout were 
standing at a smashed window. 

 ��He jumped,�� said Professor McGonagall as Harry and Luna ran into the room. 

��You mean he's dead?�� Harry sprinted to the window, ignoring Flitwick's and Sprout's yells of 
shock at his sudden appearance. 

��No, he's not dead,�� said McGonagall bitterly. ��Unlike Dumbledore, he was still carrying a 
wand... and he seems to have learned a few tricks from his master.�� 

With a tingle of horror, Harry saw in the distance a huge, bat-like shape flying through the 
darkness toward the perimeter wall. 

There were heavy footfalls behind them, and a great deal of puffing. Slughorn had just caught 
up. 

��Harry!�� he panted, massaging his immense chest beneath his emerald-green silk pajamas. ��My 
dear boy... what a surprise... Minerva, do please explain... Severus... what...?�� 

��Our headmaster is taking a short break,�� said Professor McGonagall, pointing at the Snapeshaped 
hole in the window. 

��Professor!�� Harry shouted, his hand on his forehead. He could see the Inferi-filled lake sliding 
beneath him, and he felt a ghostly green boat bump into the underground shore, and Voldemort 
lept from it with murder in his heart.

 ��Professor, we've got to barricade the school, he's coming now!�� 

��Very well. He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is coming,�� she told the other teachers. Sprout and 
Flitwick gasped. Slughorn let out a low groan. ��Potter has work to do in the castle on 
Dumbledore's orders. We need to put in place every protection of which we are capable while

��430ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Potter does what he needs to do.�� 

��You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out You-Know-Who 
indefinitely?�� squeaked Flitwick.

 ��But we can hold him up.�� said Professor Sprout. 

��Thank you, Pomona,�� said Professor McGonagall, and between the two witches there passed a 
look of grim understanding. ��I suggest we establish basic protection around the place, then gather 
our students and meet in the Great Hall. Most must be evacuated, though if any of those who are 
over age wish to stay and fight, I think they ought to be given the chance.�� 

��Agreed,�� said Professor Sprout, already hurrying toward the door. ��I shall meet you in the 
Great Hall in twenty minutes with my House.�� 

And as she jogged out of sight, they could hear her muttering, ��Tentacula, Devil's Snare. And 
Snargaluff pods... yes, I'd like to see the Death Eaters fighting those.�� 

��I can act from here,�� said Flitwick, and although he could barely see out of it, he pointed his 
wand through the smashed window and started muttering incantations of great complexity. Harry 
heard a weird rushing noise, as though Flitwick had unleashed the power of the wind into the 
grounds. 

��Professor,�� Harry said, approaching the little Charms master. ��Professor, I'm sorry to interrupt, 
but this is important. Have you got any idea where the diadem of Ravenclaw is?�� 

��-Protego Horribillis -the diadem of Ravenclaw?�� squeaked Flitwick. ��A little extra wisdom 
never goes amiss, Potter, but I hardly think it would be much use in this situation!��

 ��I only meant - do you know where it is? Have you ever seen it?��

 ��Seen it? Nobody has seen it in living memory! Long since lost, boy.��

 Harry felt a mixture of desperate disappointment and panic. What, then, was the Horcrux? 

��We shall meet you and your Ravenclaws in the Great Hall, Filius!�� said Professor 

McGonagall, beckoning to Harry and Luna to follow her. 

 They had just reached the door when Slughorn rumbled into speech. 

��My word,�� he puffed, pale and sweaty, his walrus mustache aquiver. ��What a to-do (Informal) 
panic, fuss)! I'm not at all sure whether this is wise, Minerva. He is bound to find a way in, you 
know, and anyone who has tried to delay him will be in the most grievous peril -�� 

��I shall expect you and the Slytherins in the Great Hall in twenty minutes also.�� said Professor

��431ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

McGonagall. ��If you wish to leave with your students, we shall not stop you. But if any of you 
attempt to sabotage our resistance or take up arms against us within this castle, then, Horace, we 
duel to kill.��

 ��Minerva!�� he said, aghast. 

��The time has come for Slytherin House to decide upon its loyalties,�� interrupted Professor 
McGonagall. ��Go and wake your students, Horace.�� 

Harry did not stay to watch Slughorn splutter. He and Luna stayed after Professor McGonagall, 
who had taken up a position in the middle of the corridor and raised her wand. 

��Piertotum-oh, for heaven's sake, Filch, not now -�� 

The aged caretaker had just come hobbling into view, shouting ��Students out of bed! Students 
in the corridors!�� 

��They're supposed to be, you blithering idiot!�� shouted McGonagall. ��Now go and do 
something constructive! Find Peeves!��

 'P-Peeves?�� stammered Filch as though he had never heard the name before. 

��Yes, Peeves, you fool, Peeves! Haven't you been complaining about him for a quarter of a 
century? Go and fetch him, at once.�� 

Filch evidently thought Professor McGonagall had taken leave of her senses, but hobbled away, 
hunch-shouldered, muttering under his breath. 

��And now -Piertotum Locomator!�� cried Professor McGonagall. And all along the corridor the 
statues and suits of armor jumped down from their plinths, and from the echoing crashes from the 
floors above and below, Harry knew that their fellows throughout the castle had done the same. 

��Hogwarts is threatened!�� shouted Professor McGonagall. ��Man the boundaries, protect us, do 
your duty to our school!�� 

Clattering and yelling, the horde of moving statues stampeded past Harry, some of them 
smaller, others larger than life. There were animals too, and the clanking suits of armor brandished 
swords and spiked balls on chains. 

��Now, Potter,�� said McGonagall., ��you and Miss Lovegood had better return to your friends 
and bring them to the Great Hall - I shall rouse the other Gryffindors.�� 

They parted at the top of the next staircase, Harry and Luna turning back toward the concealed 
entrance to the Room of Requirement. As they ran, they met crowds of students, most wearing

��432ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

traveling cloaks over their pajamas, being shepherded down to the Great Hall by teachers and 

prefects.

 ��That was Potter!��

 ��Harry Potter!�� 

��It was him, I swear, I just saw him!�� 

But Harry did not look back, and at last they reached the entrance to the Room of Requirement, 

Harry leaned against the enchanted wall, which opened to admit them, and he and Luna sped back 

down the steep staircase.

 ��Wh-?�� 

As the room came into view, Harry slipped down a few stairs in shock. It was packed, far more 
crowded than when he had last been in there. Kingsley and Lupin were looking up at him, as were 
Oliver Wood, Katie Bell, Angelina Johnson and Alicia Spinnet, Bill and Fleur, and Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley.

 ��Harry, what's happening?�� said Lupin, meeting him at the foot of the stairs. 

��Voldemort's on his way, they're barricading the school -Snape's run for it. What are you doing 
here? How did you know? 

��We sent messages to the rest of Dumbledore's Army,�� Fred explained. ��You couldn't expect 
everyone to miss the fun, Harry, and the D.A. let the Order of the Phoenix know, and it all kind of 
snowballed.��

 ��What first, Harry?�� called George. ��What's going on?�� 

��They're evacuating the younger kids and everyone's meeting in the Great Hall to get 
organized,�� Harry said. ��We're fighting.�� 

There was a great roar and a surge toward the stairs, he was pressed back against the wall as 
they ran past him, the mingled members of the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army, and 
Harry's old Quidditch team, all with their wands drawn, heading up into the main castle. 

��Come on, Luna,�� Dean called as he passed, holding out his free hand, she took it and followed 
him back up the stairs. 

The crowd was thinning. Only a little knot of people remained below in the Room of 
Requirement, and Harry joined them. Mrs. Weasley was struggling with Ginny. Around them 
stood Lupin, Fred, George, Bill and Fleur.

��433ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��You're underage!�� Mrs. Weasley shouted at her daughter as Harry approached ��I won't permit 

it! The boys, yes, but you, you've got to go home!��

 ��I won't!��

 Ginny's hair flew as she pulled her arm out of her mother's grip. 

 ��I'm in Dumbledore's Army-��

 ��A teenagers' gang!��

 ��A teenagers' gang that's about to take him on, which no one else has dared to do!�� said Fred. 

��She's sixteen!�� shouted Mrs. Weasley. ��She's not old enough! What you two were thinking 

bringing her with you -��

 Fred and George looked slightly ashamed of themselves. 

��Mom's right, Ginny,�� said Bill gently. ��You can't do this. Everyone underage will have to 
leave, it's only right.�� 

��I can't go home!�� Ginny shouted, angry tears sparkling in her eyes. ��My whole family's here, I 
can't stand waiting there alone and not knowing and -�� 

Her eyes met Harry's for the first time. She looked at him beseechingly, but he shook his head 
and she turned away bitterly. 

��Fine,�� she said, staring at the entrance to the tunnel back to the Hog's Head. ��I'll say good-by 
now, then, and -�� 

There was a scuffling and a great thump. Someone else had clambered out of the tunnel, 
overbalanced slightly, and fallen. He pulled himself up on the nearest chair, looked around through 
lopsided horn-rimmed glasses, and said, ��Am I too late? Has it started. I only just found out, so I I 
-�� 

Percy spluttered into silence. Evidently he had not expected to run into most of his family. 
There was a long moment of astonishment, broken by Fleur turning to Lupin and saying, in a 
wildly transparent attempt to break the tension. ��So- 'ow eez leetle Teddy?�� 

Lupin blinked at her, startled. The silence between the Weasleys seemed to be solidifying, like 

ice.

 ��I - oh yes- he's fine!�� Lupin said loudly. ��yes, Tonks is with him- at her mother's -��

 Percy and the other Weasleys were still staring at one another, frozen. 

��Here, I've got a picture?�� Lupin shouted, pulling a photograph from inside his jacket and

��434ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

showing it to Fleur and Harry, who saw a tiny baby with a tuft of bright turquoise hair, waving fat 
fists at the camera. 

��I was a fool!�� Percy roared, so loudly that Lupin nearly dropped his photograph. ��I was an 
idiot, I was a pompous prat, I was a �C a -��

 ��Ministry-loving, family-disowning, power-hungry moron,�� said Fred.

 Percy swallowed. ��Yes, I was!��

 ��Well, you can't say fairer than that,�� said Fred, holding his hand out to Percy. 

Mrs. Weasley burst into tears. She ran forward, pushed Fred aside, and pulled Percy into a 

strangling hug, while he patted her on the back, his eyes on his father.

 ��I'm sorry, Dad,�� Percy said. 

 Mr. Weasley blinked rather rapidly, then he too hurried to hug his son. 

 ��What made you see sense, Perce?�� inquired George. 

��It's been coming on for a while,�� said Percy, mopping his eyes under his glasses with a corner 
of his traveling cloak. ��But I had to find a way out and it's not so easy at the Ministry, they're 
imprisoning traitors all the time. I managed to make contact with Aberforth and he tipped me off 
ten minutes ago that Hogwarts was going to make a fight of it, so here I am.�� 

��Well, we do look to our prefects to take a lead at times such as these,�� said George in a good 
imitation of Percy's most pompous manner. ��Now let's get upstairs and fight, or all the good Death 
Eaters'll be taken.�� 

��So, you're my sister in-law now?�� said Percy, shaking hands with Fleur as they hurried off 

toward the staircase with Bill, Fred, and George. 

 ��Ginny!�� barked Mrs. Weasley.

 Ginny had been attempting, under cover of the reconciliations to sneak upstairs too. 

��Molly, how about this,�� said Lupin. ��Why doesn't Ginny stay here , then at least she'll be on 

the scene and know what's going on, but she won't be in the middle of the fighting?��

 ��I -��

 ��That's a good idea,�� said Mr. Weasley firmly, ��Ginny, you stay in this room, you hear me?�� 

Ginny did not seem to like the idea much, but under her father's unusually stern gaze, she 
nodded. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Lupin headed off to the stairs as well.

 ��Where's Ron?�� asked Harry, ��Where's Hermione?��

��435ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��They must have gone up the Great Hall already,�� Mr. Weasley called over his shoulder.

 ��I didn't see them pass me,�� said Harry.

 ��They said something about a bathroom,�� said Ginny, ��not long after you left.��

 ��A bathroom?�� 

Harry strode across the room to an open door leading off the Room of Requirement and 

checked the bathroom beyond. It was empty.

 ��You're sure they said bath -?�� 

But then his scar seared and the Room of Requirement vanished. He was looking through the 
high wrought-iron gates with winged boats on pillars at either side, looking through the dark 
grounds toward the castle, which was ablaze with lights. Nagini lay draped over his shoulders. He 
was possessed of that cold, cruel sense of purpose that preceded murder.

Chapter Thirty-One 
The Battle of Hogwarts 


The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark 


and scattered 
with stars, and below it the four long House tables 

were lined with 
disheveled students, some in traveling cloaks, others 

in dressing 
gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white 

figures of the 
school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead was fixed 

upon Professor 
McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised 

platform at the 
top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teaches, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, 
and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight. 

"... evacuation will be overseen by Mr. Filch and Madame Pomfrey. Prefects, when I give the 
word, you will organize your House and take your charges in orderly fashion to the evacuation 
point. 

Many of the students looked petrified. However, as Harry skirted the walls, scanning the 
Gryffindor table for Ron and Hermione, Ernie Macmillan stood up at the Hufflepuff table and 
shouted; "And what if we want to stay and fight?" 

 There was a smattering���� 
of applause.

 "If you are of age, you may stay." said Professor McGonagall.

 "What about our things?" called a girl at the Ravenclaw table. "Our trunks, our owls?" 

"We have no time to collect possessions." said Professor McGonagall. "The important thing is 
to get you out of here safely."

 "Where's Professor Snape?" shouted a girl from the Slytherin table. 

"He has, to use the common phrase, done a bunk (Slang) leave hastily or in a rush; escape)." 
replied Professor McGonagall and a great cheer erupted from the Gryffindors, Hufflepuffs, and 
Ravenclaws. 

Harry moved up the Hall alongside the Gryffindor table, still looking for Ron and Hermione.

��437ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

As he passed, faces turned in his direction, and a great deal of whispering broke out in his wake. 

"We have already placed protection around the castle," Professor McGonagall was saying, "but 
it is unlikely to hold for very long unless we reinforce it. I must ask you, therefore, to move 
quickly and calmly, and do as your prefects -" 

But her final words were drowned as a different voice echoed throughout the Hall. It was high, 
cold, and clear. There was no telling from where it came. It seemed to issue from the walls 
themselves. Like the monster it had once commanded, it might have lain dormant there for 
centuries. 

"I know that you are preparing to fight." There were screams amongst the students, some of 
whom clutched each other, looking around in terror for the source of the sound. "Your efforts are 
futile. You cannot fight me. I do not want to kill you. I have great respect for the teachers of 
Hogwarts. I do not want to spill magical blood." 

There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that 
seems too huge to be contained by walls. 

"Give me Harry Potter," said Voldemort's voice, "and none shall be harmed. Give me Harry 
Potter and I shall leave the school untouched. Give me Harry Potter and you will be rewarded. You 
have until midnight."

 The silence swallowed them all again. Every head turned, every eye in the place seemed to have 
found Harry, to hold him forever in the glare of thousands of invisible beams. Then a figure rose 
from the Slytherin table and he recognized Pansy Parkinson as she raised a shaking arm and 
screamed, "But he's there! Potter's there. Someone grab him!" 

Before Harry could speak, there was a massive movement. The Gryffindors in front of him had 
risen and stood facing, not Harry, but the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the 
same moment, the Ravenclaws, all of them with their backs to Harry, all of them looking toward 
Pansy instead, and Harry, awestruck and overwhelmed, saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled 
from beneath cloaks and from under sleeves. 

"Thank you, Miss Parkinson." said Professor McGonagall in a clipped voice. "You will leave 
the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow."

 Harry heard the grinding of the benches and then the sound of the Slytherins trooping out on the 
other side of the Hall. 

��438ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Ravenclaws, follow on!" cried Professor McGonagall. 

Slowly the four tables emptied. The Slytherin table was completely deserted, but a number of 
older Ravenclaws remained seated while their fellows filed out; even more Hufflepuffs stayed 
behind, and half of Gryffindor remained in their seats, necessitating Professor McGonagall's 
descent from the teachers' platform to chivvy the underage on their way.

 "Absolutely not, Creevey, go! And you, Peakes!" 

 Harry hurried over to the Weasleys, all sitting together at the Gryffindor table.

 "Where are Ron and Hermione?"

 "Haven't you found -?" began Mr. Weasley, looking worried. 

But he broke off as Kingsley had stepped forward on the raised platform to address those who 
had remained behind. 

"We've only got half an hour until midnight, so we need to act fast. A battle plan has been 
agreed between the teachers of Hogwarts and the Order of the Phoenix. Professors Flitwick, Sprout 
and McGonagall are going to take groups of fighters up to the three highest towers -Ravenclaw, 
Astronomy, and Gryffindor -where they'll have good overview, excellent positions from which to 
work spells. Meanwhile Remus" -he indicated Lupin -"Arthur" -he pointed toward Mr. Weasley, 
sitting at the Gryffindor table -"and I will take groups into the grounds. We'll need somebody to 
organize defense of the entrances or the passageways into the school -" 

"Sounds like a job for us." called Fred, indicating himself and George, and Kingsley nodded his 

approval.

 "All right, leaders up here and we'll divide up the troops!" 

"Potter," said Professor McGonagall, hurrying up to him, as students flooded the platform, 
jostling for position, receiving instructions, "Aren't you supposed to be looking for something?" 

 "What? Oh," said Harry, "oh yeah!" 

He had almost forgotten about the Horcrux, almost forgotten that the battle was being fought so 
that he could search for it. The inexplicable absence of Ron and Hermione had momentarily driven 
every other thought from his mind.

 "Then go, Potter, go!" 

 "Right - yeah -" 

He sensed eyes following him as he ran out of the Great Hall again, into the entrance hall still

��439ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

crowded with evacuating students. He allowed himself to be swept up the marble staircase with 
them, but at the top he hurried off along a deserted corridor. Fear and panic were clouding his 
thought processes. He tried to calm himself, to concentrate on finding the Horcrux, but his 
thoughts buzzed as frantically and fruitlessly as wasps trapped beneath a glass. Without Ron and 
Hermione to help him he could not seem to marshal his ideas. He slowed down, coming to a halt 
halfway along a passage, where he sat down on the plinth of a departed statue and pulled the 
Marauder's Map out of the pouch around his neck. He could not see Ron's of Hermione's names 
anywhere on it, though the density of the crowd of dots now making its way to the Room of 
Requirement might, he thought, be concealing them. He put the map away, pressed his hands over 
his face, and closed his eyes, trying to concentrate.

 Voldemort thought I'd go to Ravenclaw Tower. 

There it was, a solid fact, the place to start. Voldemort had stationed Alecto Carrow in the 
Ravenclaw common room, and there could be only one explanation: Voldemort feared that Harry 
already knew his Horcrux was connected to that House. 

But the only object anyone seemed to associate with Ravenclaw was the lost diadem... and how 
could the Horcrux be the diadem? How was it possible that Voldemort, the Slytherin, had found 
the diadem that had eluded generations of Ravenclaws? Who could have told him where to look, 
when nobody had seen the diadem in living memory?

 In living memory... 

Beneath his fingers, Harry's eyes flew open again. He leapt up from the plinth and tore back the 
way he had come, now in pursuit of his one last hope. The sound of hundreds of people marching 
toward the Room of Requirement grew louder and louder as he returned to the marble stairs. 
Prefects were shouting instructions, trying to keep track of the students in their own houses, there 
was much pushing and shouting; Harry saw Zacharias Smith bowling over first years to get to the 
front of the queue, here and there younger students were in tears, while older ones called 
desperately for friends or siblings. 

Harry caught sight of a pearly white figure drifting across the entrance hall below and yelled as 

loudly as he could over the clamor.

 "Nick! NICK! I need to talk to you!" 

He forced his way back through the tide of students, finally reaching the bottom of the stairs,

��440ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

where Nearly Headless Nick, ghost of Gryffindor Tower, stood waiting for him.

 "Harry! My dear boy!" 

Nick made to grasp Harry's hands with both of his own; Harry felt as though they had been 

thrust into icy water. 

 "Nick, you've got to help me. Who's the ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?" 

 Nearly Headless Nick looked surprised and a little offended.

 "The Gray Lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require -" 

"It's got to be her - d'you know where she is?" 

 "Let's see...�� 

Nick's head wobbled a little on his ruff as he turned hither and thither, peering over the heads of 

the swarming students. 

 "That's her over there, Harry, the young woman with the long hair." 

Harry looked in the direction of Nick's transparent, pointing finger and saw a tall ghost who 
caught sight of Harry looking at her, raised her eyebrows, and drifted away through a solid wall. 

Harry ran after her. Once through the door of the corridor into which she had disappeared, he 
saw her at the very end of the passage, still gliding smoothly away from him.

 "Hey - wait - come back!" 

She consented to pause, floating a few inches from the ground. Harry supposed that she was 
beautiful, with her waist-length hair and floor-length cloak, but she also looked haughty and proud. 
Close in, he recognized her as a ghost he had passed several times in the corridor, but to whom he 
had never spoken. 

 "You're the Gray Lady?"

 She nodded but did not speak.

 "The ghost of Ravenclaw Tower?" 

 "That is correct."

 Her tone was not encouraging.

 "Please, I need some help. I need to know anything you can tell me about the lost diadem."

 A cold smile curved her lips. "I am afraid," she said, turning to leave, "that I cannot help you."

 "WAIT!" 

 He had not meant to shout, but anger and panic were threatening to overwhelm him. He glanced

��441ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

at his watch as she hovered in front of him. It was a quarter to midnight.

 "This is urgent." he said fiercely. "If that diadem's at Hogwarts, I've got to find it, fast." 

"You are hardly the first student to covet the diadem." she said disdainfully. "Generations of 
students have badgered me -" 

"This isn't about trying to get better marks!" Harry shouted at her, "It's about Voldemort defeating 
Voldemort - or aren't you interested in that?" 

She could not blush, but her transparent cheeks became more opaque, and her voice was heated 
as she replied, "Of course I - how dare you suggest -?"

 "Well, help me then!" 

Her composure was slipping. "It -it is not a question of -" she stammered. "-my mother's 

diadem?" 

 "Your mother's?" 

 She looked angry with herself. "When I lived," she said stiffly, "I was Helena Ravenclaw."

 "You're her daughter? But then, you must know what happed to it." 

"While the diadem bestows wisdom," she said with an obvious effort to pull herself together, "I 

doubt that it would greatly increase you chances of defeating the wizard who calls himself Lord -" 

"Haven't I told you, I'm not interested in wearing it!" Harry said fiercely. "There's no time to 
explain -but if you care about Hogwarts, if you want to see Voldemort finished, you've got to tell 
me anything you know about the diadem!" 

She remained quite still, floating in midair, staring down at him, and a sense of hopelessness 
engulfed Harry. Of course, if she had known anything, she would have told Flitwick or 
Dumbledore, who had surely asked her the same question. He had shaken his head and made to 
turn away when she spoke in a low voice.

 "I stole the diadem from my mother."

 "You - you did what?" 

"I stole the diadem." repeated Helena Ravenclaw in a whisper. "I sought to make myself 
cleverer, more important than my mother. I ran away with it." 

He did not know how he had managed to gain her confidence and did not ask, he simply 
listened, hard, as she went on. 

"My mother, they say, never admitted that the diadem was gone, but pretended that she had it

��442ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

still. She concealed her loss, my dreadful betrayal, even from the other founders of Hogwarts. 

"Then my mother fell ill -fatally ill. In spite of my perfidy����ʵ 
,���� 
, she was desperate to 
see me one more time. She sent a man who had long loved me, though I spurned����ؾܾ� 
his 
advances, to find me. She knew that he would not rest until he had done so." 

 Harry waited. She drew a deep breath and threw back her head. 

"He tracked me to the forest where I was hiding. When I refused to return with him, he became 
violent. The baron was always a hot-tempered man. Furious at my refusal, jealous of my freedom, 
he stabbed me."

 "The Baron? You mean -?" 

"The Bloody Baron, yes," said the Gray Lady, and she lifted aside the cloak she wore to reveal 
a single dark wound in her white chest. ��When he saw what he had done, he was overcome with 
remorse. He took the weapon that had claimed my life, and used it to kill himself. All these 
centuries later, he wears his chains as an act of penitence ... as he should." she added bitterly.

 "And - and the diadem?" 

"It remained where I had hidden it when I heard the Baron blundering through the forest toward 
me. Concealed inside a hollow tree."

 "A hollow tree?" repeated Harry. "What tree? Where was this?" 

 "A forest in Albania. A lonely place I thought was far beyond my mother's reach." 

"Albania," repeated Harry. Sense was emerging miraculously from confusion, and now he 
understood why she was telling him what she had denied Dumbledore and Flitwick. "You've 
already told someone this story, haven't you? Another student?" 

 She closed her eyes and nodded.

 "I had... no idea... He was flattering. He seemed to... understand... to sympathize...�� 

Yes, Harry thought. Tom Riddle would certainly have understood Helena Ravenclaw's desire to 
possess fabulous objects to which she had little right. 

"Well, you weren't the first person Riddle wormed things out of." Harry muttered. "He could be 
charming when he wanted...�� 

So, Voldemort had managed to wheedle��ƭ the location of the lost diadem out of the Gray 
Lady. He had traveled to that far-flung forest and retrieved the diadem from its hiding place, 
perhaps as soon as he left Hogwarts, before he even started work at Borgin and Burkes.

And wouldn't those secluded Albanian woods have seemed an excellent refuge when, so much 
later, Voldemort had needed a place to lie low, undisturbed, for ten long years? 

But the diadem, once it became his precious Horcrux, had not been left in that lowly tree. No, 
the diadem had been returned secretly to its true home, and Voldemort must have put it there �C 

 ��- the night he asked for a job!�� said Harry, finishing his thought.

 ��I beg your pardon?�� 

��He hid the diadem in the castle, the night he asked Dumbledore to let him teach!�� said Harry. 
Saying it out loud enabled him to make sense of it all. ��He must��ve hidden the diadem on his way 
up to, or down from, Dumbledore��s office! But it was well worth trying to get the job �C then he 
might��ve got the chance to nick Gryffindor��s sword as well �C thank you, thanks!�� 

Harry left her floating there, looking utterly bewildered. As he rounded the corner back into the 
entrance hall, he checked his watch. It was five minutes until midnight, and though he now knew 
what the last Horcrux was, he was no closer to discovering where it was... 

Generations of students had failed to find the diadem; that suggested that it was not in 
Ravenclaw Tower �C but if not there, where? What hiding place had Tom Riddle discovered inside 
Hogwarts Castle, that he believed would remain secret forever? 

Lost in desperate speculation, Harry turned a corner, but he had taken only a few steps down 
the new corridor when the window to his left broke open with a deafening, shattering crash. As he 
leapt aside, a gigantic body flew in through the window and hit the opposite wall. 

Something large and furry detached itself, whimpering, from the new arrival and flung itself at 
Harry. 
��Hagrid!�� Harry bellowed, fighting off Fang the boarhound��s attentions as the enormous 

bearded figure clambered to his feet ��What the -?��

 ��Harry, yer here! Yer here!�� 

Hagrid stooped down, bestowed upon Harry a cursory and rib-cracking hug, then ran back to 
the shattered window. 

��Good boy, Grawpy!�� he bellowed through the hole in the window. ��I��ll see yer in a moment, 
there��s a good lad!�� 

Beyond Hagrid, out in the dark night, Harry saw bursts of light in the distance and heard a 
weird, keening (2. lament, mourn) scream. He looked down at his watch. It was midnight. The

��444ҳ��

battle had begun. 

 ��Blimey, Harry,�� panted Hagrid, ��this is it, eh? Time ter fight?��

 ��Hagrid, where have you come from?�� 

��Heard You-Know-Who from up in our cave,�� said Hagrid grimly. ��Voice carried, didn��t it? 
'Yet got till midnight ter gimme Potter.' Knew yeh mus�� be here, knew that mus�� be happenin��. Get 
down, Fang. So we come ter join in, me an�� Grawpy an�� Fang. Smashed our way through the 
boundary by the forest, Grawpy was carryin�� us, Fang an�� me. Told him ter let me down at the 
castle, so he shoved me through the window, bless him. Not exactly what I meant, bu�� �C where��s 
Ron an�� Hermione?��

 ��That,�� said Harry, ��is a really good question. Come on.�� 

They hurried together along the corridor, Fang lolloping�����ıĵ��� beside them. Harry 
could hear movement through the corridors all around, running footsteps, shouts; through the 
windows, he could see more flashes of light in the dark grounds. 

��Where��re we goin��?�� puffed Hagrid, pounding along at Harry��s heels, making the floorboards 
quake. 

��I dunno exactly,�� said Harry, making another random turn, ��but Ron and Hermione must be 
around here somewhere.�� 

The first casualties of the battle were already strewn across the passage ahead. The two stone 
gargoyles that usually guarded the entrance to the staffroom had been smashed apart by a jinx that 
had sailed through another broken window. Their remains stirred feebly on the floor, and as Harry 
leapt over one of their disembodied heads, it moaned faintly. ��Oh, don��t mind me ... I��ll just be 
here and crumble.�� 

Its ugly stone face made Harry think suddenly of the marble bust of Rowena Ravenclaw at 
Xenophilius��s house, wearing that mad headdress �C and then of the statue in Ravenclaw Tower, 
with the stone diadem upon her white curls. 

And as he reached the end of the passage, the memory of a third stone effigyФ�� 
;���� 
came 
back to him, that of an ugly old warlock, onto whose head Harry himself had placed a wig and a 
battered old hat. The shock shot through Harry with the heat of firewhisky, and he nearly 
stumbled.

 He knew, at last, where the Horcrux sat waiting for him.

Tom Riddle, who confided in no one and operated alone, might have been arrogant enough to 
assume that he, and only he, had penetrated the deepest mysteries of Hogwarts Castle. Of course, 
Dumbledore and Flitwick, those model pupils, had never set foot in that particular place, but he, 
Harry, had strayed off the beaten track in his time at school �C here at least was a secret area he and 
Voldemort knew, that Dumbledore had never discovered. 

He was roused by Professor Sprout, who was thundering past followed by Neville and half a 
dozen others, all of them wearing earmuffs and carrying what appeared to be large potted plants. 

��Mandrakes!�� Neville bellowed at Harry over his shoulder as he ran. ��Going to lob them over 
the walls �C they won��t like this!�� 

Harry knew now where to go. He sped off, with Hagrid and Fang galloping behind him. They 
passed portrait after portrait, and the painted figures raced alongside them, wizards and witches in 
ruffs and breeches, in armor and cloaks, cramming themselves into each others�� canvases, 
screaming news from other parts of the castle. As they reached the end of this corridor, the whole 
castle shook, and Harry knew, as a gigantic vase blew off its plinth with explosive force, that it 
was in the grip of enchantments more sinister than those of the teachers and the Order. 

��It��s all righ��, Fang �C it��s all righ��!�� yelled Hagrid, but the great boarhound had taken flight as 
slivers of china flew like shrapnel through the air, and Hagrid pounded off after the terrified dog, 
leaving Harry alone. 

He forged on��(��ͣ��)Ŭ��ǰ���� through the trembling passages, his wand at the ready, 
and for the length of one corridor the little painted knight, Sir Cadrigan, rushed from painting to 
painting beside him, clanking along in his armor, screaming encouragement, his fat little pony 
cantering behind him.

 ��Braggarts and rogues, dogs and scoundrels, drive them out, Harry Potter, see them off!�� 

Harry hurtled around a corner and found Fred and a small knot of students, including Lee 
Jordan and Hannah Abbott, standing beside another empty plinth, whose statue had concealed a 
secret passageway. Their wands were drawn and they were listening at the concealed hole. 

��Nice night for it!�� Fred shouted as the castle quaked again, and Harry sprinted by, elated and 
terrified in equal measure. Along yet another corridor he dashed, and then there were owls 
everywhere, and Mrs. Norris was hissing and trying to bat them with her paws, no doubt to return 
them to their proper place.

��Potter!��

 Aberforth Dumbledore stood blocking the corridor ahead, his wand held ready.

 ��I��ve had hundreds of kids thundering through my pub, Potter!�� 

��I know, we��re evacuating,�� Harry said, ��Voldemort��s �C�� 

���C attacking because they haven��t handed you over, yeah,�� said Aberforth. ��I��m not deaf, the 
whole of Hogsmeade heard him. And it never occurred to any of you to keep a few Slytherins 
hostage? There are kids of Death Eaters you��ve just sent to safety. Wouldn��t it have been a bit 
smarter to keep 'em here?�� 

��It wouldn��t stop Voldemort,�� said Harry, ��and your brother would never have done it.�� 

Aberforth grunted and tore away in the opposite direction. 

Your brother would never have done it... Well, it was the truth, Harry thought as he ran on 
again, Dumbledore, who had defended Snape for so long, would never have held students ransom. 

And then he skidded around a final corner and with a yell of mingled relief and fury he saw 
them, Ron and Hermione; both with their arms full of large, curved, dirty yellow objects, Ron with 
a broomstick under his arms.

 ��Where the hell have you been?�� Harry shouted. 

 ��Chamber of Secrets,�� said Ron. 

 ��Chamber �C what?�� said Harry, coming to an unsteady halt before them. 

��It was Ron, all Ron��s idea!�� said Hermione breathlessly. ��Wasn��t it absolutely brilliant? There 
we were, after we left, and I said to Ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid 

of it? We still hadn��t got rid of the cup! And then he thought of it! The basilisk!��

 ��What the �C?��

 ��Something to get rid of Horcruxes,�� said Ron simply. 

Harry��s eyes dropped to the objects clutched in Ron and Hermione��s arms, great curved fangs; 
torn, he now realized, from the skull of a dead basilisk. {�Ƿ�Ӧ����Ron��s and Hermione��s arm} 

��But how did you get in there?�� he asked, staring from the fangs to Ron. ��You need to speak 
Parseltongue!�� 

��He did!�� whispered Hermione. ��Show him, Ron!�� Ron made a horrible strangled hissing noise. 

��It��s what you did to open the locket,�� he told Harry apologetically. ��I had to have a few goes 
to get it right, but,�� he shrugged modestly, ��we got there in the end.��

��447ҳ��

��He was amazing!�� said Hermione. ��Amazing!��

 ��So ...�� Harry was struggling to keep up. ��So ...�� 

��So we��re another Horcrux down,�� said Ron, and from under his jacket he pulled the mangled 
remains of Hufflepuff��s cup. ��Hermione stabbed it. Thought she should. She hasn��t had the 
pleasure yet.�� 

��Genius!�� yelled Harry. 

��It was nothing,�� said Ron, though he looked delighted with himself. ��So what��s new with 
you?�� 

As he said it, there was an explosion from overhead. All three of them looked up as dust fell 
from the ceiling and they heard a distant scream. 

��I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,�� said Harry, talking fast. ��He hid it 
exactly where I had my old Potions book, where everyone��s been hiding stuff for centuries. He 
thought he was the only one to find it. Come on.�� 

As the walls trembled again, he led the other two back through the concealed entrance and down 
the staircase into the Room of Requirement. It was empty except for three women, Ginny, Tonks 
and an elderly witch wearing a moth-eaten hat, whom Harry recognized immediately as Neville��s 
grandmother. 

��Ah, Potter,�� she said crisply as if she had been waiting for him. ��You can tell us what��s going 
on.�� 

��Is everyone okay?�� said Ginny and Tonks together.

 ����S far as we know,�� said Harry. ��Are there still people in the passage to the Hog��s Head?��

 He knew that the room would not be able to transform while there were still users inside it. 

��I was the last to come through,�� said Mrs. Longbottom. ��I sealed it, I think it unwise to leave it 
open now Aberforth has left his pub. Have you seen my grandson?��

 ��He��s fighting,�� said Harry. 

��Naturally,�� said the old lady proudly. ��Excuse me, I must go and assist him.�� With surprising 

speed she trotted off toward the stone steps. 

 Harry looked at Tonks. 

 ��I thought you were supposed to be with Teddy at your mother��s?�� 

��I couldn��t stand not knowing �C�� Tonks looked anguished. ��She��ll look after him �C have you

seen Remus?�� 

��He was planning to lead a group of fighters into the grounds �C��

 Without another word, Tonks sped off. 

��Ginny,�� said Harry, ��I��m sorry, but we need you to leave too. Just for a bit. Then you can 
come back in.��

 Ginny looked simply delighted to leave her sanctuary. 

��And then you can come back in!�� he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after Tonks. 
��You��ve got to come back in!��

 ��Hang on a moment!�� said Ron sharply. ��We��ve forgotten someone!�� 

��Who?�� asked Hermione.

 ��The house-elves, they��ll all be down in the kitchen, won��t they?�� 

��You mean we ought to get them fighting?�� asked Harry. 

��No,�� said Ron seriously, ��I mean we should tell them to get out. We don��t want anymore 
Dobbies, do we? We can��t order them to die for us �C�� 

There was a clatter as the basilisk fangs cascaded out of Hermione��s arms. Running at Ron, she 
flung them around his neck and kissed him full on the mouth. Ron threw away the fangs and 
broomstick he was holding and responded with such enthusiasm that he lifted Hermione off her 
feet. 

��Is this the moment?�� Harry asked weakly, and when nothing happened except that Ron and 
Hermione gripped each other still more firmly and swayed on the spot, he raised his voice. ��Oi! 
There��s a war going on here!�� 

Ron and Hermione broke apart, their arms still around each other. 

��I know, mate,�� said Ron, who looked as though he had recently been hit on the back of the 
head with a Bludger, ��so it��s now or never������ʧ����ʧ����, isn��t it?�� 

��Never mind that, what about the Horcrux?�� Harry shouted. ��D��you think you could just �C just 
hold it in until we��ve got the diadem?�� 

��Yeah �C right �C sorry �C�� said Ron, and he and Hermione set about gathering up fangs, both pink 
in the face. 

It was clear, as the three of them stepped back into the corridor upstairs, that in the minutes that 
they had spent in the Room of Requirement the situation within the castle had deteriorated

severely. The walls and ceiling were shaking worse than ever; dust filled the air, and through the 
nearest window, Harry saw bursts of green and red light so close to the foot of the castle that he 
knew the Death Eaters must be very near to entering the place. Looking down, Harry saw Grawp 
the giant meandering past, swinging what looked like a stone gargoyle torn from the roof and 
roaring his displeasure.

 ��Let��s hope he steps on some of them!�� said Ron as more screams echoed from close by. 

��As long as it��s not any of our lot!�� said a voice, Harry turned and saw Ginny and Tonks, both 
with their wands drawn at the next window, which was missing several panes. Even as he watched, 
Ginny sent a well-aimed jinx into a crowd of fighters below. 

��Good girl!�� roared a figure running through the dust toward them, and Harry saw Aberforth 
again, his gray hair flying as he led a small group of students past. ��They look like they might be 
breaching the north battlements, they��ve brought giants of their own.��

 ��Have you seen Remus?�� Tonks called after him.

 ��He was dueling Dolohov,�� shouted Aberforth, ��haven��t seen him since!�� 

��Tonks,�� said Ginny, ��Tonks, I��m sure he��s okay �C��

 But Tonks had run off into the dust after Aberforth. 

 Ginny turned, helpless, to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 

��They��ll be all right,�� said Harry, though he knew they were empty words. ��Ginny, we��ll be 
back in a moment, just keep out of the way, keep safe �C come on!�� he said to Ron and Hermione, 
and they ran back to the stretch of wall beyond which the Room of Requirement was waiting to do 
the bidding of the next entrant. 

I need the place where everything is hidden. Harry begged of it inside his head, and the door 
materialized on their third run past. 

The furor of the battle died the moment they crossed the threshold and closed the door behind 
them. All was silent. They were in a place the size of a cathedral with the appearance of a city, its 
towering walls built of objects hidden by thousands of long-gone students. 

��And he never realized anyone could get in?�� said Ron, his voice echoing in the silence. ��He 
thought he was the only one,�� said Harry. ��Too bad for him I��ve had to hide stuff in my time ... 
this way,�� he added. ��I think it��s down here.�� 

They sped off up adjacent aisles; Harry could hear the others�� footsteps echoing through the

��450ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

towering piles of junk, of bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, bats... 

��Somewhere near here,�� Harry muttered to himself. ��Somewhere ... somewhere ...�� 

Deeper and deeper into the labyrinth he went, looking for objects he recognized from his one 
previous trip into the room. His breath was loud in his ears, and then his very soul seemed to 
shiver. There it was, right ahead, the blistered old cupboard in which he had hidden his old Potions 
book, and on top of it, the pockmarked stone warlock wearing a dusty old wig and what looked 
like an ancient discolored tiara. 

He had already stretched out his hand, though he remained few feet away, when a voice behind 
him said, ��Hold it, Potter.�� 

He skidded to a halt and turned around. Crabbe and Goyle were standing behind him, shoulder 
to shoulder, wands pointing right at Harry. Through the small space between their jeering faces he 
saw Draco Malfoy. 

��That��s my wand you��re holding, Potter,�� said Malfoy, pointing his own through the gap 
between Crabbe and Goyle. 

��Not anymore,�� panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. ��Winners, keepers, 
Malfoy. Who��s lent you theirs?��

 ��My mother,�� said Draco. 

Harry laughed, though there was nothing very humorous about the situation. He could not hear 

Ron or Hermione anymore. They seemed to have run out of earshot, searching for the diadem.

 ��So how come you three aren��t with Voldemort?�� asked Harry. 

��We��re gonna be rewarded,�� said Crabbe. His voice was surprisingly soft for such an enormous 
person. Harry had hardly ever heard him speak before. Crabbe was speaking like a small child 
promised a large bag of sweets. ��We 'ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you 
to 'im.�� 

��Good plan,�� said Harry in mock admiration. He could not believe that he was this close, and 
was going to be thwarted by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. He began edging slowly backward 
toward the place where the Horcrux sat lopsided upon the bust. If he could just get his hands on it 
before the fight broke out ... 

 ��So how did you get in here?�� he asked, trying to distract them. 

��I virtually lived in the Room of Hidden Things all last year,�� said Malfoy, his voice brittle. ��I

��451ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

know how to get in.�� 

��We was hiding in the corridor outside,�� grunted Goyle. ��We can do Disslusion Charms now! 
And then,�� his face split into a gormless grin, ��you turned up right in front of us and said you was 
looking for a die-dum! What��s a die-dum?�� 

��Harry?�� Ron��s voice echoed suddenly from the other side of the wall to Harry��s right. ��Are you 
talking to someone?�� 

With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty foot mountain of old furniture, 
of broken trunks, of old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, ��Descendo!�� 

The wall began to totter, then the top third crumbled into the aisle next door where Ron stood. 

��Ron!�� Harry bellowed, as somewhere out of sight Hermione screamed, and Harry heard 
innumerable objects crashing to the floor on the other side of the destabilized wall. He pointed his 
wand at the rampart, cried, ��Finite!�� and it steadied. 

��No!�� shouted Malfoy, staying (stop, restrain) Crabbe��s arm as the latter made to repeat his 
spell. ��If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!�� 

��What��s that matter?�� said Crabbe, tugging himself free. ��It��s Potter the Dark Lord wants, who 
cares about a die-dum?�� 

��Potter came in here to get it,�� said Malfoy with ill-disguised impatience at the slow-wittedness 
of his colleagues. ��so that must mean �C�� 

����Must mean?�� Crabbe turned on Malfoy with undisguised ferocity. ��Who cares what you 
think? I don��t take your orders no more, Draco. You an�� your dad are finished.�� 

��Harry?�� shouted Ron again, from the other side of the junk wall. ��What��s going on?�� 

��Harry?�� mimicked Crabbe. ��What��s going on �C no, Potter! Crucio!�� 

Harry had lunged for the tiara; Crabbe��s curse missed him but hit the stone bust, which flew into 
the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which 
the bust had rested. 

��STOP!�� Malfoy shouted at Crabbe, his voice echoing through the enormous room. ��The Dark 
Lord wants him alive �C�� 

��So? I��m not killing him, am I?�� yelled Crabbe, throwing off Malfoy��s restraining arm. ��But if I 
can, I will, the Dark Lord wants him dead anyway, what��s the diff �C?�� 

A jet of scarlet light shot past Harry by inches, Hermione had run around the corner behind him

��452ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and sent a Stunning Spell straight at Crabbe��s head. It only missed because Malfoy pulled him out 

of the way. 

��It��s that Mudblood! Avada Kedavra!�� 

Harry saw Hermione dive aside, and his fury that Crabbe had aimed to kill wiped all else from 
his mind. He shot a Stunning Spell at Crabbe, who lurched out of the way, knocking Malfoy��s 
wand out of his hand; it rolled out of sight beneath a mountain of broken furniture and bones. 

��Don��t kill him! DON��T KILL HIM!�� Malfoy yelled at Crabbe and Goyle, who were both 
aiming at Harry, their split second��s hesitation was all Harry needed. 

��Expelliarmus!�� 

Goyle��s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark (fortress wall) of objects 
beside him; Goyle leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it; Malfoy jumped out of range of 
Hermione��s second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full 
Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, which narrowly missed. 

Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, ��Avada Kedavra!�� again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid 
the jet of green light. The wand-less Malfoy cowered behind a three-legged wardrobe as Hermione 
charged toward them, hitting Goyle with a Stunning Spell as she came. 

��It��s somewhere here!�� Harry yelled at her, pointing at the pile of junk into which the old tiara 

had fallen. ��Look for it while I go and help R �C�� 

��HARRY!�� she screamed. 

A roaring, billowing noise behind him gave him a moment��s warning. He turned and saw both 

Ron and Crabbe running as hard as they could up the aisle toward them. 

��Like it hot, scum?�� roared Crabbe as he ran. 

But he seemed to have no control over what he had done. Flames of abnormal size were 
pursuing them, licking up the sides of the junk bulwarks, which were crumbling to soot at their 
touch. 

��Aguamenti!�� Harry bawled, but the jet of water that soared from the tip of his wand evaporated 
in the air. 

��RUN!�� 

Malfoy grabbed the Stunned Goyle and dragged him along; Crabbe outstripped all of them, now 

looking terrified; Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them. It

��453ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

was not normal fire; Crabbe had used a curse of which Harry had no knowledge. As they turned a 
corner the flames chased them as though they were alive, sentient (conscious), intent upon killing 
them. Now the fire was mutating, forming a gigantic pack of fiery beasts, Flaming serpents, 
chimaeras, and dragons rose and fell and rose again, and the detritus of centuries on which they 
were feeding was thrown up into the air into their fanged mouths, tossed high on clawed feet, 
before being consumed by the inferno. 

Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had vanished from view, Harry, Ron and Hermione stopped dead; 
the fiery monsters were circling them, drawing closer and closer, claws and horns and tails lashed, 
and the heat was solid as a wall around them. 

��What can we do?�� Hermione screamed over the deafening roars of the fire. ��What can we do?�� 

��Here!�� 

Harry seized a pair of heavy-looking broomsticks from the nearest pile of junk and threw one to 
Ron, who pulled Hermione onto it behind him. Harry swung his leg over the second broom and, 
with hard kicks to the ground, they soared up in the air, missing by feet the horned beak of a 
flaming raptor���� 
that snapped its jaws at them. The smoke and heat were becoming 
overwhelming, Below them the cursed fire was consuming the contrabandΥ��Ʒ of generations 
of hunted students, the guilty outcomes of a thousand banned experiments, the secrets of the 
countless souls who had sought refuge in the room. Harry could not see a trace of Malfoy, Crabbe, 
or Goyle anywhere. He swooped as low as he dare over the marauding monsters of flame to try to 
find them, but there was nothing but fire. What a terrible way to die... He had never wanted this... 

��Harry, let��s get out, let��s get out!�� bellowed Ron, though it was impossible to see where the 
door was through the black smoke. 

And then Harry heard a thin, piteous human scream from amidst the terrible commotion, the 
thunder of devouring flame. 

��It��s �C too �C dangerous �C!�� Ron yelled, but Harry wheeled in the air. His glasses giving his eyes 
some small protection from the smoke, he raked the firestorm below, seeking a sign of life, a limb 
or a face that was not yet charred like wood... 

And he saw them, Malfoy with his arms around the unconscious Goyle, the pair of them perched 
on a fragile tower of charred desks, and Harry dived. Malfoy saw him coming and raised one arm, 
but even as Harry grasped it he knew at once that it was no good. Goyle was too heavy and

��454ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Malfoy��s hand, covered in sweat, slid instantly out of Harry��s. 

��IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I��LL KILL YOU, HARRY!�� roared Ron��s voice, and, as a great 
flaming chimaera bore down upon them, he and Hermione dragged Goyle onto their broom and 
rose, rolling and pitching, into the air once more as Malfoy clambered up behind Harry. 

��The door, get to the door, the door!�� screamed Malfoy in Harry��s ear, and Harry sped up, 
following Ron, Hermione, and Goyle through the billowing black smoke, hardly able to breathe, 
and all around them the last few objects unburned by the devouring flames were flung into the air, 
as the creatures of the cursed fire cast them high in celebration, cups and shields, a sparkling 
necklace, and an old, discolored tiara �C 

��What are you doing, what are you doing, the door��s that way!�� screamed Malfoy, but Harry 
made a hairpin swerve and dived. The diadem seemed to fall in slow motion, turning and glittering 
as it dropped toward the maw (throat of an animal) of a yawning serpent, and then he had it, caught 
it around his wrist �C 

Harry swerved again as the serpent lunged at him; he soared upward and straight toward the 
place where, he prayed, the door stood open; Ron, Hermione and Goyle had vanished; Malfoy was 
screaming and holding Harry so tightly it hurt. Then, through the smoke, Harry saw a rectangular 
patch on the wall and steered the broom at it, and moments later clean air filled his lungs and they 
collided with the wall in the corridor beyond. 

Malfoy fell off the broom and lay facedown, gasping, coughing, and retching. Harry rolled over 
and sat up. The door to the Room of Requirement had vanished, and Ron and Hermione sat 
panting on the floor beside Goyle, who was still unconscious. 

��C-Crabbe,�� choked Malfoy as soon as he could speak. ��C-Crabbe ...�� 

��He��s dead,�� said Ron harshly. 

There was silence, apart from panting and coughing. Then a number of huge bangs shook the 
castle, and a great cavalcade [.k.vl'ke.d]�����н� 
;����� 
of transparent figures galloped past 
on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when 
the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around, The battle was still going on all around him. He 
could hear more scream than those of the retreating ghosts. Panic flared within him. 

��Where��s Ginny?�� he said sharply. ��She was here. She was supposed to be going back into the 
Room of Requirement.��

��Blimey, d��you reckon it��ll still work after that fire?�� asked Ron, but he too got to his feet, 
rubbing his chest and looking left and right. ��Shall we split up and look �C?�� 

��No,�� said Hermione, getting to her feet too. Malfoy and Goyle remained slumped hopelessly 
on the corridor floor; neither of them had wands. ��Let��s stick together. I say we go �C Harry, what��s 
that on your arm?�� 

��What? Oh yeah �C�� 

He pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot, but as 
he looked at it closely he was just able to make out the tiny words etched upon it; WIT BEYOND 
MEASURE IS MAN��S GREATEST TREASURE. 

A blood-like substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from the diadem. Suddenly Harry 
felt the thing vibrate violently, then break apart in his hands, and as it did so, he thought he heard 
the faintest, most distant scream of pain, echoing not from the grounds or the castle, but from the 
thing that had just fragmented in his fingers. 

��It must have been Fiendfyre!�� whimpered Hermione, her eyes on the broken piece. 

��Sorry?�� 

��Fiendfyre �C cursed fire �C it��s one of the substances that destroy Horcruxes, but I would never, 
ever have dared use it, it��s so dangerous �C how did Crabbe know how to �C?�� 

��Must��ve learned from the Carrows,�� said Harry grimly. 

��Shame he wasn��t concentrating when they mentioned how to stop it, really,�� said Ron, whose 

hair, like Hermione��s, was singed, and whose face was blackened. ��If he hadn��t tried to kill us all, 

I��d be quite sorry he was dead.�� 

��But don��t you realize?�� whispered Hermione. ��This means, if we can just get the snake �C�� 

But she broke off as yells and shouts and the unmistakable noises of dueling filled the corridor. 
Harry looked around and his heart seemed to fail, Death Eaters had penetrated Hogwarts. Fred and 
Percy had just backed into view, both of them dueling masked and hooded men. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help. Jets of light flew in every direction and the man 
dueling Percy backed off, fast. Then his hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked 
hair. 

��Hello, Minister!�� bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his 
wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. ��Did I mention I��m

resigning?�� 

��You��re joking, Perce!�� shouted Fred as the Death Eater he was battling collapsed under the 
weight of three separate Stunning Spells. Thicknesse had fallen to the ground with tiny spikes 
erupting all over him; he seemed to be turning into some form of sea urchin. Fred looked at Percy 
with glee. 

��You actually are joking, Perce... I don��t think I��ve heard you joke since you were �C�� 

The air exploded. They had been grouped together, Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, and Percy, the 
two Death Eaters at their feet, one Stunned, the other Transfigured; and in that fragment of a 
moment, when danger seemed temporarily at bay, the world was rent apart. Harry felt himself 
flying through the air, and all he could do was hold as tightly as possible to that thin stick of wood 
that was his one and only weapon, and shield his head in his arms, He heard the screams and yells 
of his companions without a hope of knowing what had happened to them. 

And then the world resolved itself into pain and semidarkness. He was half buried in the 
wreckage of a corridor that had been subjected to a terrible attack. Cold air told him that the side of 
the castle had been blown away, and hot stickiness on his cheek told him that he was bleeding 
copiously. Then he heard a terrible cry that pulled at his insides, that expressed agony of a kind 
neither flame nor curse could cause, and he stood up, swaying, more frightened than he had been 
that day, more frightened, perhaps, than he had been in his life... 

And Hermione was struggling to her feet in the wreckage, and three redheaded men were 
grouped on the ground where the wall had blasted apart. Harry grabbed Hermione��s hand as they 
staggered and stumbled over stone and wood. 

��No �C no �C no!�� someone was shouting. ��No! Fred! No!�� 

And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred��s eyes stared 
without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.

Chapter Thirty-Two 
The Elder Wand 


The world had ended, so why had the battle 


not ceased, 
the castle fallen silent in horror, and every 

combatant 
laid down their arms? 
Harry's mind was in free fall, spinning out of 

control, 
unable to grasp the impossibility, because Fred 

Weasley 
could not be dead, the evidence of all his senses 

must be 
lying... 
And then a body fell past the hole blown into the side of the school and curses flew in at them 
from the darkness, hitting the wall behind their heads. 

"Get down!" Harry shouted, as more curses flew through the night, He and Ron had both 
grabbed Hermione and pulled her to the floor, but Percy lay across Fred's body, shielding it from 
further harm, and when Harry shouted "Percy, come on, we've got to move!" he shook his head. 

"Percy!" Harry saw tear tracks streaking the grime coating Ron's face as he sezied his elder 
brother's shoulders and pulled, but Percy would not budge. "Percy, you can't do anything for him! 
We're going to -" 

Hermione screamed, and Harry, turning, did not need to ask why. A monstrous spider the size of 
a small car was trying to climb through the huge hole in the wall. One of Aragog's descendants had 
joined the fight. 

Ron and Harry shouted together; their spells collided and the monster was blown backward, its 
legs jerking horribly, and vanished into the darkness. 

"It brought friends!" Harry called to the others, glancing over the edge of the castle through the 
hole in the wall the curses had blasted. More giant spiders were climbing the side of the building, 
liberated from the Forbidden Forest, into which the Death Eaters must have penetrated. Harry fired 
Stunning Spells down upon them, knocking the lead monster into its fellows, so that they rolled 
back down the building and out of sight. Then more curses came soaring over Harry's head, so 
close he felt the force of them blow his hair. 

"Let's move, NOW!"

Pushing Hermione ahead of him with Ron, Harry stooped to seize Fred's body under the armpit. 
Percy, realizing what Harry was trying to do, stopped clinging to the body and helped, together, 
crouching low to avoid the curses flying at them from the grounds, they hauled Fred out of the 
way. 

"Here," said Harry, and they placed him in a niche where a suit of armor had stood earlier. He 
could not bear to look at Fred a second longer than he had to, and after making sure that the body 
was well-hidden, he took off after Ron and Hermione. Malfoy and Goyle had vanished but at the 
end of the corridor, which was now full of dust and falling masonry, glass long gone from 
windows, he saw many people running backward and forward, whether friends or foes he could 
not tell. Rounding the corner, Percy let out a bull-like roar, "ROOKWOOD!" and sprinted off in 
the direction of a tall man, who was pursuing a couple of students. 

"Harry, in here!" Hermione screamed. 

She had pulled Ron behind a tapestry. They seemed to be wrestling together, and for one mad 
second Harry thought that they were embracing again; then he saw that Hermione was trying to 
restrain Ron, to stop him running after Percy. 

"Listen to me -LISTEN RON!" 

"I wanna help -I wanna kill Death Eaters -" 

His face was contorted, smeared with dust and smoke, and he was shaking with rage and grief. 

"Ron, we're the only ones who can end it! Please �C Ron -we need the snake, we've got to kill the 
snake!" said Hermione. 

But Harry knew how Ron felt. Pursuing another Horcrux could not bring the satisfaction of 
revenge; he too wanted to fight, to punish them, the people who had killed Fred, and he wanted to 
find the other Weasleys, and above all make sure, make quite sure, that Ginny was not -but he 
could not permit that idea to form in his mind. 

"We will fight!" Hermione said. "We'll have to... to reach the snake! But let's not lose sight now 
of what we're supposed to be d -doing! We're the only ones who can end it!" 

She was crying too, and she wiped her face on her torn and singed sleeve as she spoke, but she 
took great heaving breaths to calm herself as, still keeping a tight hold on Ron, she turned to Harry. 
"You need to find out where Voldemort is, because he'll have the snake with him, won't he? Do it, 
Harry, look inside him!"

Why was it so easy? Because his scar had been burning for hours, yearning to show him 
Voldemort's thoughts. He closed his eyes on her command, and at once, the screams and bangs and 
all the discordant sounds of the battle were drowned until they became distant, as though he stood 
far, far away from them... 

He was standing in the middle of a desolate but strangely familiar room, with peeling paper on 
the walls and all the windows boarded up except for one. The sounds of the assault on the castle 
were muffled and distant. The single unblocked window revealed distant bursts of light where the 
castle stood, but inside the room was dark except for a solitary oil lamp. He was rolling his wand 
between his figners, watching it, his thoughts on the room in the castle, the secret room only he 
had ever found, the room, like the chamber, that you had to be clever and cunning and inquisitive 
to discover... He was confident that the boy would not find the diadem... although Dumbledore's 
puppet had come much farther than he ever expected... too far... 

"My Lord," said a voice, desperate and cracked. He turned, there was Lucius Malfoy sitting in 
the darkest corner, ragged and still bearing the marks of the punishment he had received after the 
boy's last escape. One of his eyes remained closed and puffy. "My Lord... please... my son...�� 

"If your son is dead, Lucius, it is not my fault. He did not come and join me, like the rest of the 

Slytherins. Perhaps he has decided to befriend Harry Potter?" 

"No -never," whispered Malfoy. 

"You must hope not." 

"Aren't -aren't you afraid, my Lord that Potter might die at another hand but yours?" asked 
Malfoy, his voice shaking. "Wouldn't it be... forgive me... more prudent to call off this battle, enter 
the castle, and seek him y-yourself?" 

"Do not pretend Lucius. You wish the battle to cease so that you can discover what has 
happened to your son. And I do not need to seek Potter. Before the night is out, Potter will have 
come to find me." Voldemort dropped his gaze once more to the wand in his fingers. It troubled 
him... and those things that troubled Lord Voldemort needed to be rearranged... "Go and fetch 
Snape." 

"Snape, m-my Lord?" 

"Snape. Now. I need him. There is a -service -I require from him. Go." 

Frightened, stumbling a little through the gloom, Lucius left the room. Vodlemort continued to

stand there, twirling the wand between his fingers, staring at it. "It is the only way, Nagini," he 
whispered, and he looked around, and there was the great thick snake, now suspended in midair, 
twisting gracefully within the enchanted, protected space he had made for her, a starry, transparent 
sphere somewhere between a glittering cage and a tank. 

With a gasp, Harry pulled back and opened his eyes at the same moment his ears were assaulted 
with the screeches and cries, the smashes and bangs of battle. 

"He's in the Shrieking Shack. The snake's with him, it's got some sort of magical protection 
around it. He's just sent Lucius Malfoy to find Snape." 

"Voldemort��s sitting in the shrieking Shack?" said Hermione, outraged. "He's not -he's not even 
FIGHTING?" 

"He doesn't think he needs to fight," said Harry. "He thinks I'm going to go to him." 

"But why?" 

"He knows I'm after Horcruxes -he's keeping Nagini close beside him -obviously I'm going to 
have to go to him to get near the thing -" 

"Right," said Ron, squaring his shoulders. "So you can't go, that's what he wants, what he's 
expecting. You stay here and look after Hermione, and I'll go and get it -" 

Harry cut across Ron. "You two stay here, I'll go under the Cloak and I'll be back as soon as I -" 

"No," said Hermione, "it makes much more sense if I take the Cloak and -" 

"Don't even think about it," Ron snarled at her. 

Before Hermione could get farther than "Ron, I'm just as capable -" the tapestry at the top of the 

staircase on which they stood was ripped open. 

"POTTER!" Two masked Death Eaters stood there, but even before their wands were fully 
raised, Hermione shouted "Glisseo!" The stairs beneath their feet flatteneed into a chute and she, 
Harry, and Ron hurtled down it, unable to control their speed but so fast that the Death Eaters' 
Stunning Spells flew far over their heads. They shot through the concealing tapestry at the bottom 
and spun onto the floor, hitting the opposite wall. 

"Duro!" cried Hermione, pointing her wand at the tapestry, and there were two loud, sickening 
crunches as the tapestry turned to stone and the Death Eaters pursuing them crumpled against it. 

"Get back!" shouted Ron, and he, Harry, and Hermione hurled themselves against a door as a 
herd of galloping desks thundered past, shepherdd by a sprinting Professor McGonagall. She

��461ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

appeared not to notice them. Her hair had come down and there was a gash on her cheek. As she 

turned the corner, they heard her scream, "CHARGE!" 

"Harry, you get the Cloak on," said Hermione. "Never mind us -" 

But he threw it over all three of them; large though they were he doubted anyone would see their 
disembodied feet through the dust that clogged the air, the falling stone, and the shimmer of spells. 
They ran down the next staircase and found themselves in a corridor full of duelers. The portraits 
on either side of the fighters were crammed with figures screaming advice and encouragement, 
while Death Eaters, both masked and unmasked, dueled students and teachers. Dean had won 
himself a wand, for he was face-to-face with Dolohov, Parvati with Travers. Harry, Ron and 
Hermione raised their wands at once, ready to strike, but the duelers were weaving and darting so 
much that there was a strong likelihood of hurting one of their own side if they cast curses. Even as 
they stood braced, looking for the opportunity to act, there came a great "Wheeeeee!" and looking 
up, Harry saw Peeves zoomign over them, dropping Snargaluff pods down onto the Death Eaters, 
whose heads were suddenly engulfed in wriggling green tubers like fat worms. 

"ARGH!" A fistful of tubers had hit the Cloak over Ron's head; the damp green roots were 
suspended improbably in midair as Ron tried to shake them loose. 

"Someone's invisible there!" shouted a masked Death Eater, pointing. Dean made the most of 
the Death Eater's momentary distraction, knocking him out with a stunning Spell; Dolohov 
attempted to retaliate, and Parvati shot a Body Bind Curse at him. 

"LET'S GO!" Harry yelled, and he, Ron, and Hermione gathered the Cloak tightly around 
themselves and pelted, heads down, through the midst of the fighters, slipping a little in pools of 
Snargaluff juice, toward the top of the marble staircase into the entrance hall. 

"I'm Draco Malfoy, I'm Draco, I'm on your side!" Draco was on the upper landing, pleading 
with anoter masked Death Eater. Harry Stunned the Death Eater as they passed. Malfoy looked 
around, beaming, for his savior, and Ron punched him from under the Cloak. Malfoy fell 
backward on top of the Death Eater, his mouth bleeding, utterly bemused. 

"And that's the second time we've saved your life tonight, you two-faced (hypocrite; disloyal) 
bastard!" Ron yelled. 

There were more duelers all over the stairs and in the hall, Death Eaters everywhere Harry 
looked: Yaxley, close to the front doors, in combat with Flitwick, a masked Death Eater dueling

��462ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Kingsley right beside them. Students ran in every direction; some carrying or dragging injured 
friends. Harry directed a Stunnning Spell toward the masked Death Eater; it missed but nearly hit 
Neville, who had emerged from nowhere brandishing armfuls of Venomous Tentacula, which 
looped���� 
itself happily around the nearest Death Eater and began reeling him in. 

Harry, Ron, and Hermione sped down the marble staircase, glass shattered on the left, and the 
Slytherin hourglass that had recorded House points spilled its emeralds everywhere, so that people 
slipped and staggered as they ran. Two bodies fell from the balcony overhead as they reached the 
ground, and a gray blur that Harry took for an animal sped four-legged across the hall to sink its 
teeth into one of the fallen. 

"NO!" shrieked Hermione, and with a deafening blast from her wand, Fenrir Greyback was 
thrown backward from the feebly struggling body of Lavender Brown. He hit the marble banisters 
and struggled to return to his feet. Then, with a bright white flash and a crack, a crystal ball fell on 
top of his head, and he crumpled to the ground and did not move. 

"I have more!" shrieked Professor Trelawney from over the banisters. "More for any who want 
them! Here -" And with a move like a tennis serve���� 
, she heaved another enormous crystal 
sphere from her bag, waved her wand through the air, and caused the ball to speed across the hall 
and smash through a window. 

At the same moment, the heavy wooden front doors burst open, and more of the gigantic spiders 
forced their way into the front hall. Screams of terror rent the air, the fighters scattered, Death 
Eaters and Hogwartians alike, and red and green jets of light flew into the midst of the oncoming 
monsters, which shuddered and reared, more terrifying than ever. 

"How do we get out?" yelled Ron over all the screaming, but before either Harry or Hermione 
could answer they were bowled aside; Hagrid had come thundering down the stairs, brandishing 
his flowery pink umbrella. 

"Don't hurt 'em, don't hurt 'em!" he yelled. 

"HAGRID, NO!" Harry forgot everything else, he sprinted out from under the cloak, running 
bent double to avoid the curses illuminating the whole hall. 

"HAGRID, COME BACK!" But he was not even halfway to Hagrid when he saw it happen, 
Hagrid vanished amongst the spiders, and with a great scurrying, a foul swarming movement, they 
retreated under the onslaught of spells, Hagrid buried in their midst.

��463ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"HAGRID!" 

Harry heard someone calling his own name, whether friend or foe he did not care, He was 
springint down the front steps into the dark grounds, and the spiders were swarming away with 
their prey, and he could see nothing of Hagrid at all. 

"HAGRID!" 

He thought he could make out an enormous arm waving from the mdist of the spider swarm, but 
as he made to chase after them, his way was impeded by a monumental foot, which swung down 
out of the darkness and made the ground on which he stood shudder. He looked up. A giant stood 
before him, twenty feet high, its head hidden in shadow, nothing but its tree-like hairy shins 
illuminated by light from the castle doors. With one brutal, fluid movement, it smashed a massive 
fist through an upper window, and glass rained down upon Harry, forcing him back under the 
shelter of the doorway. 

"Oh my -!" shrieked Hermione, as she and Ron caught up with Harry and gazed upward at the 
giant now trying to seize people through the window above. 

"DON'T!" Ron yelled, grabbing Hermione's hand as she raised her wand. "Stun him and he'll 
crush half the castle -" 

"HAGGER?" Grawp came lurching around the corner of the castle; only now did Harry realzie 
that Grawp was, indeed, an undersized giant. The gargantuan [g��.'g.nt...n] (enormous, huge) 
monster trying to crush people on the upper floors turned around and let out a rorar. The stone 
steps tremebled as he stomped toward his smaller kin, and Grawp's lopsided mouth fell open, 
showing yellow, half brick-sized teeth; and then they launched themselves at each other with the 
savagery of lions. 

"RUN!" Harry roared; the ngiht was full of hideous yells and blows as the giants wrestled, and 
he seized Hermione's hand and tore down the steps into the grounds, Ron bringing up the rear. 
Harry had not lost hope of finding and saving Hagrid; he ran so fast that they were halfway toward 
the forest before they were brought up shortֹ����ǰ again. 

The air around them had frozen, Harry's breath caught and solidified in his chest. Shapes moved 
out in the darkness, swirling figures of concentrated blackness, moving in a great wave towards the 
castles, their faces hooded and their breath rattling... 

Ron and Hermione closed in beside him as the sounds of fighting behind them grew suddenly

��464ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

muted, deadened, because a silence only dementors could bring was falling thickly through the 
night, and Fred was gone, and Hagrid was surely dying or already dead... 

"Come on, Harry!" said Hermione's voice from a very long way away. "Patronuses, Harry, come 
on!" he raised his wand, but a dull hopelessness was spreading throughout him. 

How many more lay dead that he did not yet know about? He felt as though his soul had already 
half left his body. 

"HARRY, COME ON!" screamed Hermione. 

A hundred dementors were advancing, gliding toward them, sucking their way closer to Harry's 

despair, which was like a promise of a feast... 

He saw Ron's silver terrierһ�ֹ� 
burst into the air, flicker feebly, and expire; he saw 
Hermione's otter twist in midair and fade, and his own wand trembled in his hand, and he almost 
welcomed the oncoming oblivion, the promise of nothing, of no feeling... 

And then a silver hare, a boar, and fox soared past Harry, Ron, and Hermione's heads, the 
dementors fell back before the creatures' approach. Three more people had arrived out of the 
darkness to stand beside them, their wands outstretched, continuing to cast Patronuses, Luna, 
Ernie, and Seamus. 

"That's right," said Luna encouragingly, as if they were back in the Room of Requirement and 
this was simply spell practice for the D.A., "That's right, Harry... come on think of something 
happy...�� 

'Something happy?" he said, his voice cracked. 

"We're all still here," she whispered, "we��re still fighting. Come on, now." 

There was a silver spark, then a wavering light, and then, with the greatest effort it had ever cost 
him the stag burst from the end of Harry's wand. It cantered forward, and now the dementors 
scattered in earnest, and immediately the night was mild again, but the sounds of the surrounding 
battle were loud in his ears. 

"Can't thank you enough," said Ron shakily, turning to Luna, Ernie, and Seamus "you just saved 
-" 

With a roar and an earth-quaking tremor, another giant came lurching out of the darkness from 
the direction of the forest, brandishing a club taller than any of them. 

"RUN!" Harry shouted again, but the others needed no telling; They all scattered, and not a

��465ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

second too soon��ǰ 
;���� 
, for the next moment the creature's vast foot had fallen exactly where 
they had been standing. 

Harry looked round, Ron and Hermione were following him, but the other three had vanished 
back into the battle. 

"Let's get out of range!" yelled Ron as the giant swung its club again and its bellows echoed 
through the night, across the grounds where bursts of red and green light continued to illuminate 
the darkness. 

"The Whomping willow," said Harry, "go!" 

Somehow he walled it all up in his mind, crammed it into a small space into which he could not 
look now, thoughts of Fred and Hagrid, and his terror for all the people he loved, scattered in and 
outside the castle, must all wait, because they had to run, had to reach the snake and Voldemort, 
because that was, as Hermione said, the only way to end it. 

He sprinted, half-believing he could outdistance death itself, ignoring the jets of light flying in 
the darkness all around him, and the sound of the lake crashing like the sea, and the creaking of the 
Forbidden Forest though the night was windless; through grounds that seemed themselves to have 
risen in rebellion, he ran faster than he had ever moved in his life, and it was he who saw the great 
tree first, the Willow that protected the secret at its roots with whiplike, slashing branches. Panting 
and gasping, Harry slowed down, skirting the willow's swiping branches, peering through the 
darkness toward its tick trunk, trying to see the single knot in the bark of the old tree that would 
paralyze it. Ron and Hermione caught up, Hermione so out of breath that she could not speak. 

"How -how're we going to get in?" panted Ron. "I can��t -see the place -if we jsut had -
Crookshanks again -" 

"Crookshanks?" wheezed Hermione, bent double, clutching her chest. "Are you a wizard, or 
what?" 

"Oh �C right �C yeah -" Ron looked around, then directed his wand at a twig on the ground and 
said "Winguardium Leviosa!" 

The twig flew up from the gruond, spun through the air as if caught by a gust of wind, then 
zoomed directly at the trunk through the Willow's ominously swaying branches. It jabbed at a 
place near the roots, and at once, the writhing tree became still. 

"Perfect!" panted Hermione.

��466ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Wait." 

For one teetering second, while the crashes and booms of the battle filled the air, Harry 
hesitated. Voldemort wanted him to do this, wanted him to come... Was he leading Ron and 
Hermione into a trap? 

But the reality seemed to close upon him, cruel and plain, the only way forward was to kill the 

snake, and the snake was where Voldemort was, and voldemort was at the end of this tunnel... 

"Harry, we're coming, just get in there!" said Ron, pushing him forward. 

Harry wriggled into the earthy passage hidden in the tree's roots. It was a much tighter squeeze 
than it had been the last time they had entered it. The tunnel was low-ceilinged, they had had to 
double up to move throuhgh it nearly four years previously; now there was nothing for it but to 
crawl. Harry went first, his wand illuminated, expecting at any moment to meet barriers, but none 
came. They moved in silence, Harry's gaze fixed upon the swinging beam of the wand held in his 
fist. 

At last, the tunnel began to slope upward and Harry saw a sliver of light ahead. 

Hermione tugged at his ankle. "The Cloak!" she whispered. "Put the Cloak on!" 

He groped behind him and she forced the bundle of slippery cloth into his free hand. With 
difficulty he dragged it over himself, murmered, "Nox," extinguishing his wandlight, and 
continued on his hands and knees, as silently as possible, all his senses straining, expecting every 
second to be discovered, to hear a cold clear voice, see a flash of green light. 

And then he heard voices coming from the room directly ahead of them, only slightly muffled 
by the fact that the opening at the end of the tunnel had been blocked up by what looked like an old 
crate. Hardly daring to breathe, Harry edged right up to the opening and peered through a tiny gap 
left between crate and wall. The room beyond was dimly lit, but he could see Nagini, swirlign and 
coiling like a serpent underwater, safe in her enchanted, starry sphere, which floated unsupported 
in midair. He could see the edge of a table, and a long-fingered white hand toying with a wand. 
Then Snape spoke, and Harry's heart lurched, Snape was inches away from where he crouched, 
hidden. 

"... my Lord, their resistance is crumbling -" 

"-and it is doing so without your help," said Voldemort in his high, clear voice. "Skilled wizard 
though you are, Severus, I do not think you will make much difference now. We are almost there...

��467ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

almost." 

"Let me find the boy. Let me bring you Potter. I know I can find him, my Lord. Please." Snape 
strode past the gap, and Harry drew back a little, keeping his eyes fixed upon Nagini, wondering 
whether there was any spell that might penetrate the protection surrounding her, but he could not 
think of anything. One failed attempt, and he would give away his position... Voldemort stood up. 
Harry could see him now, see the red eyes, the flattened, serpentine face, the pallor of him 
gleaming slightly in the semidarkness. 

"I have a problem, Severus," said Voldemort softly. 

"My Lord?" said Snape. 

Voldemort raised the Elder Wand, holding it as delicately and precisely as a conductor's baton. 
"Why doesn't it work for me, Severus?" 

In the silence Harry imagined he could hear the snake hissing slightly as it coiled and uncoiled or 
was it Voldemort's sibilant˻˻������ sigh lingering on the air? 

"My -my lord?" said Snape blankly. "I do not understand. You -you have performed 
extraordinary magic with that wand." 

"No," said Voldemort. "I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand... 
no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the 
one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago." 

Voldemort's tone was musing, calm, but Harry's scar had begun to throb and pulse. Pain was 

building in his forehead, and he could feel that controlled sense of fury building inside Voldemort. 

"No difference," said Voldemort again. 

Snape did not speak. Harry could not see his face. He wondered whether Snape sensed danger, 
was trying to find the right words to reassure his master. 

Voldemort started to move around the room, Harry lost sight of him for seconds as he prowled, 
speaking in that same measured voice, while the pain and fury mounted in Harry. 

"I have thought long and hard, Severus... do you know why I have called you back from battle?" 

And for a moment Harry saw Snape's profile. His eyes were fixed upon the coiling snake in its 

enchanted cage. 

"No, my Lord, but I beg you will let me return. Let me find Potter." 

"You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He does not need finding.

��468ҳ��

Potter will come to me. I knew his weakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the 
others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at 
any cost. He will come." 

"But my Lord, he might be killed accidentally by someone other than yourself -" 

"My instructions to the Death Eaters have been perfectly clear. Capture Potter. Kill his friends the 
more, the better -but do not kill him. But it is of you that I wished to speak, Severus, not Harry 
Potter. You have been very valuable to me. Very valuable." 

"My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But -let me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me 
bring him to you. I know I can -" 

"I have told you, no!" said Voldemort, and Harry caught the light of red in his eyes as he turned 
again, and the swishing of his cloak was like the slithering of a snake, and he felt Voldemort's 
impatience in his burning scar. 

"My concern at the moment, Severus, is what will happen when I finally meet the boy!" 

"My Lord, there can be no question, surely -?" 

"-but there is a question, Severus. There is." Voldemort halted, and Harry could see him plainly 
again as he slid the Elder Wand through his white fingers, staring at Snape. "Why did both the 

wands I have used fail when directed at Harry Potter?" 

"I -I cannot answer that, my Lord." 

"Can't you?" 

The stab of rage felt like a spike driven through Harry's head, he forced his own fist into his 
mouth to stop himself from crying out in pain. He closed his eyes, and suddenly he was 
Voldemort, looking into Snape's pale face. 

"My wand of yew did everything of which I asked it, Severus, except to kill Harry Potter. Twice 
it failed. Ollivander told me under torture of the twin cores, told me to take another's wand. I did 
so, but Lucius's wand shattered upon meeting Potter's." 

"I -I have no explanation, my Lord." Snape was not looking at Voldemort now. His dark eyes 
were still fixed upon the coiling serpent in its protective sphere. 

"I sought a third wand, Severus. The Elder Wand, the Wand of Destiny, the Deathstick. I took it 
from its previous master. I took it from the grave of Albus Dumbledore." 

And now Snape looked at Voldemort, and Snape's face was like a death mask. It was marble

��469ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

white and so still that when he spoke, it was a shock to see that anyone lived behind the blank 

eyes. 

"My Lord -let me go to the boy -" 

"All this long night when I am on the brink of victory, I have sat here," said Voldemort, his 
voice barely louder than a whisper, "wondering, wondering, why the Elder Wand refuses to be 
what it ought to be, refuses to perform as legend says it must perform for its rightful owner... and I 
think I have the answer." 

Snape did not speak. 

"Perhaps you already know it? You are a clever man, after all, Severus. You have been a good 
and faithful servant, and I regret what must happen." 

"My Lord -" 

"The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not its true master. The Elder 

Wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. You killed Albus Dumbledore. While you 

live, Severus, the Elder Wand cannot truly be mine." 

"My Lord!" Snape protested, raising his wand. 

"It cannot be any other way," said Voldemort. "I must master the wand, Severus. Master the 

wand, and I master Potter at last." 

And Voldemort swiped the air with the Elder Wand. It did nothing to Sanpe, who for a split 
second seemed to think he had been reprievedִ�л��� 
, but then Voldemort's intention became 
clear. The snake's cage was rolling through the air, and before Snape could do anything more than 
yell, it had encased him, head and shoulders, and Voldemort spoke in Parseltongue. 

"Kill." 

There was a terrible scream. Harry saw Snape's face losing the little color it had left; it whitened 
as his black eyes widened, as the snake's fangs pierced his neck, as he failed to push the enchanted 
cage off himself, as his knees gave way and he fell to the floor. 

"I regret it," said Voldemort coldly. 

He turned away; there was no sadness in him, no remorse. It was time to leave this shack and 
take charge, with a wand that would now do his full bidding. He pointed it at the starry cage 
holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood 
gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance,

��470ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

and the great serpent floated after him in its huge protective sphere. 

Back in the tunnel and his own mind, Harry opened his eyes. He had drawn blood biting down 
on his knuckles in an effort not to shout out. Now he was looking through the tiny crack between 
crate and wall, watching a foot in a black boot trembling on the floor. 

"Harry!" breathed Hermione behind him, but he had already pointed his wand at the crate 
blocking his view. It lifted an inch into the air and drifted sideways silently. As quietly as he could, 
he pulled himself up into the room. 

He did not know why he was doing it, why he was approaching the dying man, he did not know 
what he felt as he saw Snape's white face, and the fingers trying to staunch the bloody wound at his 
neck. Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down upon the man he hated, whose 
widening black eyes found Harry as he tried to speak. Harry bent over him, and Snape seized the 
front of his robes and pulled him close. 

A terrible rasping, gurgling noise issued from Snape's throat. 

"Take... it... Take... it...�� 

Something more than blood was leaking from Snape. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it 
gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes, and Harry knew what it was, but did not know 
what to do - 

A flask, conjured from thin air, was thrust into his shaking hand by Hermione. Harry lfited the 
silvery substance into it with his wand. When the flask was full to the brim, and Snape looked as 
though there was no blood left in him, his grip on Harry's robes slackened. 

"Look... at... me...�� he whispered. 

The green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair 
seemed to vanish, leaving them fixed, blank and empty. The hand holding Harry thudded to the 
floor, and Snape moved no more.

Chapter Thirty-Three 
The Prince��s Tale 


Harry remained kneeling at Snape��s side, 
down at him, until quite suddenly a high, cold 
close to them that Harry jumped on his feet, the 
tightly in his hands, thinking that Voldemort had 
room. 

Voldemort��s voice reverberated from the 


simply staring 
voice spoke so 
flask gripped 
reentered the 

walls and floor, 

and Harry realized that he was talking to Hogwarts and to all the surrounding area, that the 
residents of Hogsmeade and all those still fighting in the castle would hear him as clearly as if he 
stood beside them, his breath on the back of their necks, a deathblow������� 
away. 

��You have fought,�� said the high, cold voice, ��valiantly. Lord Voldemort knows how to value 
bravery. 

��Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. 
I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste.

 ��Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately.

 ��You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured. 

��I speak now, Harry Potter, directly to you. You have permitted your friends to die for you 
rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one hour in the Forbidden Forest. If, at the end of that 
hour, you have not come to me, have not given yourself up, then battle recommences. This time, I 
shall enter the fray myself, Harry Potter, and I shall find you, and I shall punish every last man, 
woman, and child who has tried to conceal you from me. One hour.��

 Both Ron and Hermione shook their heads frantically, looking at Harry.

 ��Don��t listen to him,�� said Ron. 

��It��ll be all right,�� said Hermione wildly. ��Let��s �C let��s get back to the castle, if he��s gone to the 
forest we��ll need to think of a new plan �C�� 

She glanced at Snape��s body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed her. Harry 
gathered up the Invisibility Cloak, then looked down at Snape. He did not know what to feel, 
except shock at the way Snape had been killed, and the reason for which it had been done.

��472ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

They crawled back through the tunnel, none of them talking, and Harry wondered whether Ron 
and Hermione could still hear Voldemort ringing in their heads as he could. 

You have permitted your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. I shall wait for one 
hour in the Forbidden Forest... One hour... 

Small bundles seemed to litter the lawn at the front of the castle. It could only be an hour or so 
from dawn, yet it was pitch-black. The three of them hurried toward the stone steps. A lone clog 
(wooden shoe), the size of a small boat, lay abandoned in front of them. There was no other sign of 
Grawp or of his attacker. 

The castle was unnaturally silent. There were no flashes of light now, no bangs or screams or 
shouts. The flagstones of the deserted entrance hall were stained with blood. Emeralds were still 
scattered all over the floor, along with pieces of marble and splintered wood. Part of the banisters 
had been blown away.

 ��Where is everyone?�� whispered Hermione.

 Ron led the way to the Great Hall. Harry stopped in the doorway. 

The House tables were gone and the room was crowded. The survivors stood in groups, their 
arms around each other��s necks. The injured were being treated upon the raised platform by 
Madam Pomfrey and a group of helpers. Firenze was amongst the injured; his flank poured blood 
and he shook where he lay, unable to stand. 

The dead lay in a row in the middle of the Hall. Harry could not see Fred��s body, because his 
family surrounded him. George was kneeling at his head; Mrs. Weasley was lying across Fred��s 
chest, her body shaking. Mr. Weasley stroking her hair while tears cascaded down his cheeks. 

Without a word to Harry, Ron and Hermione walked away. Harry saw Hermione approach 
Ginny, whose face was swollen and blotchy, and hug her. Ron joined Bill, Fleur, and Percy, who 
flung an arm around Ron��s shoulders. As Ginny and Hermione moved closer to the rest of the 
family, Harry had a clear view of the bodies lying next to Fred. Remus and Tonks, pale and still 
and peaceful-looking, apparently asleep beneath the dark, enchanted ceiling. 

The Great Hall seemed to fly away, become smaller, shrink, as Harry reeled backward from the 
doorway. He could not draw breath. He could not bear to look at any of the other bodies, to see 
who else had died for him. He could not bear to join the Weasleys, could not look into their eyes, 
when if he had given himself up in the first place, Fred might never have died... 

��473ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He turned away and ran up the marble staircase. Lupin, Tonks... He yearned not to feel... He 
wished he could rip out his heart, his innards, everything that was screaming inside him... 

The castle was completely empty; even the ghosts seemed to have joined the mass mourning in 
the Great Hall. Harry ran without stopping, clutching the crystal flask of Snape��s last thoughts, and 
he did not slow down until he reached the stone gargoyle guarding the headmaster��s office. 

 ��Password?�� 

��Dumbledore!�� said Harry without thinking, because it was he whom he yearned to see, and to 
his surprise the gargoyle slid aside revealing the spiral staircase behind. 

But when Harry burst into the circular office he found a change. The portraits that hung all 
around the walls were empty. Not a single headmaster or headmistress remained to see him; all, it 
seemed, had flitted away, charging through the paintings that lined the castle so that they could 
have a clear view of what was going on. 

Harry glanced hopelessly at Dumbledore��s deserted frame, which hung directly behind the 
headmaster��s chair, then turned his back on it. The stone Pensieve lay in the cabinet where it had 
always been. Harry heaved it onto the desk and poured Snape��s memories into the wide basin with 
its runic markings around the edge. To escape into someone else��s head would be a blessed relief... 
Nothing that even Snape had left him could be worse than his own thoughts. The memories 
swirled, silver white and strange, and without hesitating, with a feeling of reckless abandonment, 
as though this would assuage his torturing grief, Harry dived. 

He fell headlong into sunlight, and his feet found warm ground. When he straightened up, he 
saw that he was in a nearly deserted playground. A single huge chimney dominated the distant 
skyline. Two girls were swinging backward and forward, and a skinny boy was watching them 
from behind a clump of bushes. His black hair was overlong and his clothes were so mismatched 
that it looked deliberate, too short jeans, a shabby, overlarge coat that might have belonged to a 
grown man, an odd smockŮʽ����-like shirt. 

Harry moved closer to the boy. Snape looked no more than nine or ten years old, sallow, small, 
stringy. There was undisguised greed̰�� 
,̰�� 
in his thin face as he watched the younger of the 
two girls swinging higher and higher than her sister. 

 ��Lily, don��t do it!�� shrieked the elder of the two. 

But the girl had let go of the swing at the very height of its arc and flown into the air, quite

��474ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

literally flown, launched herself skyward with a great shout of laughter, and instead of crumpling 
on the playground asphalt, she soared like a trapeze�߿���ǧ 
artist through the air, staying up far 
too long, landing far too lightly.

 ��Mummy told you not to!�� 

Petunia stopped her swing by dragging the heels of her sandals on the ground, making a 
crunching, grinding sound, then leapt up, hands on hips. 

 ��Mummy said you weren��t allowed, Lily!��

 ��But I��m fine,�� said Lily, still giggling. ��Tuney, look at this. Watch what I can do.�� 

Petunia glanced around. The playground was deserted apart from themselves and, though the 
girls did not know it, Snape. Lily had picked up a fallen flower from the bush behind which Snape 
lurked. Petunia advanced, evidently torn between curiosity and disapproval. Lily waited until 
Petunia was near enough to have a clear view, then held out her palm. The flower sat there, 
opening and closing its petals, like some bizarre, many-lipped oyster.

 ��Stop it!�� shrieked Petunia. 

��It��s not hurting you,�� said Lily, but she closed her hand on the blossom and threw it back to 
the ground. 

��It��s not right,�� said Petunia, but her eyes had followed the flower��s flight to the ground and 
lingered upon it. ��How do you do it?�� she added, and there was definite longing in her voice. 

��It��s obvious, isn��t it?�� Snape could no longer contain himself, but had jumped out from behind 
the bushes. Petunia shrieked and ran backward toward the swings, but Lily, though clearly startled, 
remained where she was. Snape seemed to regret his appearance. A dull flush of color mounted the 
sallow cheeks as he looked at Lily.

 ��What��s obvious?�� asked Lily. 

Snape had an air of nervous excitement. With a glance at the distant Petunia, now hovering 
beside the swings, he lowered his voice and said, ��I know what you are.��

 ��What do you mean?��

 ��You��re... you��re a witch,�� whispered Snape. 

 She looked affronted. ��That��s not a very nice thing to say to somebody!��

 She turned, nose in the air, and marched off toward her sister. 

��No!�� said Snape. He was highly colored now, and Harry wondered why he did not take off the

��475ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

ridiculously large coat, unless it was because he did not want to reveal the smock beneath it. He 
flapped after the girls, looking ludicrously bat-like, like his older self. 

The sisters considered him, united in disapproval, both holding on to one of the swing poles, as 
though it was the safe place in tag׽�Բ���Ϸ. 

��You are,�� said Snape to Lily. ��You are a witch. I��ve been watching you for a while. But 
there��s nothing wrong with that. My mum��s one, and I��m a wizard.��

 Petunia��s laugh was like cold water. 

��Wizard!�� she shrieked, her courage returned now that she had recovered from the shock of his 
unexpected appearance. ��I know who you are. You��re that Snape boy! They live down Spinner��s 
End by the river,�� she told Lily, and it was evident from her tone that she considered the address a 
poor recommendation. ��Why have you been spying on us?�� 

��Haven��t been spying,�� said Snape, hot and uncomfortable and dirty-haired in the bright 

sunlight. ��Wouldn��t spy on you, anyway,�� he added spitefully, ��you��re a Muggle.��

 Though Petunia evidently did not understand the word, she could hardly mistake the tone. 

��Lily, come on, we��re leaving!�� she said shrilly. Lily obeyed her sister at once, glaring at Snape 
as she left. He stood watching them as they marched through the playground gate, and Harry, the 
only one left to observe him, recognized Snape��s bitter disappointment, and understood that Snape 
had been planning this moment for a while, and that it had all gone wrong... 

The scene dissolved and, before Harry knew it, re-formed around him. He was now in a small 
thicket of trees. He could see a sunlit river glittering through their trunks. The shadows cast by the 
trees made a basin of cool green shade. Two children sat facing each other, cross-legged on the 
ground. Snape had removed his coat now; his odd smock looked less pecular in the half light.

 ��... and the Ministry can punish you if you do magic outside school, you get letters.��

 ��But I have done magic outside school!�� 

��We��re all right. We haven��t got wands yet. They let you off when you��re a kid and you can��t 
help it. But once you��re eleven,�� he nodded importantly, ��and they start training you, then you��ve 
got to go careful.�� 

There was a little silence. Lily had picked up a fallen twig and twirled it in the air, and Harry 
knew that she was imagining sparks trailing from it. Then she dropped the twig, leaned in toward 
the boy, and said, ��It is real, isn��t it? It��s not a joke? Petunia says you��re lying to me. Petunia says

��476ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

there isn��t a Hogwarts. It is real, isn��t it?��

 ��It��s real for us,�� said Snape. ��Not for her. But we��ll get the letter, you and me.��

 ��Really?�� whispered Lily. 

��Definitely,�� said Snape, and even with his poorly cut hair and his odd clothes, he struck an 

oddly impressive figure sprawled in front of her, brimful of confidence in his destiny.

 ��And will it really come by owl?�� Lily whispered. 

��Normally,�� said Snape. ��But you��re Muggle-born, so someone from the school will have to 

come and explain to your parents.��

 ��Does it make a difference, being Muggle-born?��

 Snape hesitated. His black eyes, eager in the greenish gloom, moved over the pale face, the dark 

red hair. 

 ��No,�� he said. ��It doesn��t make any difference.��

 ��Good,�� said Lily, relaxing. It was clear that she had been worrying.

 ��You��ve got loads of magic,�� said Snape. ��I saw that. All the time I was watching you...�� 

His voice trailed away; she was not listening, but had stretched out on the leafy ground and was 

looking up at the canopy of leaves overhead. He watched her as greedily as he had watched her in 

the playground.

 ��How are things at your house?�� Lily asked. 

 A little crease appeared between his eyes.

 ��Fine,�� he said.

 ��They��re not arguing anymore?�� 

��Oh yes, they��re arguing,�� said Snape. He picked up a fistful of leaves and began tearing them 

apart, apparently unaware of what he was doing. ��But it won��t be that long and I��ll be gone.��

 ��Doesn��t your dad like magic?��

 ��He doesn��t like anything, much,�� said Snape.

 ��Severus?��

 A little smile twisted Snape��s mouth when she said his name.

 ��Yeah?��

 ��Tell me about the dementors again.��

 ��What d��you want to know about them for?��

��477ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��If I use magic outside school �C�� 

��They wouldn��t give you to the dementors for that! Dementors are for people who do really bad 
stuff. They guard the wizard prison, Azkaban. You��re not going to end up in Azkaban, you��re too 
�C�� 

He turned red again and shredded more leaves. Then a small rustling noise behind Harry made 

him turn, Petunia, hiding behind a tree, had lost her footing.

 ��Tuney!�� said Lily, surprise and welcome in her voice, but Snape had jumped to his feet.

 ��Who��s spying now?�� he shouted. ��What d��you want?�� 

Petunia was breathless, alarmed at being caught. Harry could see her struggling for something 
hurtful to say. 

��What is that you��re wearing, anyway?�� she said, pointing at Snape��s chest. ��Your mum��s 
blouse?�� 

There was a crack. A branch over Petunia��s head had fallen. Lily screamed. The branch caught 
Petunia on the shoulder, and she staggered backward and burst into tears.

 ��Tuney!��

 But Petunia was running away. Lily rounded on Snape. 

 ��Did you make that happen?��

 ��No.�� He looked both defiant and scared. 

 ��You did!�� She was backing away from him. ��You did! You hurt her!��

 ��No �C no, I didn��t!�� 

But the lie did not convince Lily. After one last burning look, she ran from the little thicket, off 

after her sister, and Snape looked miserable and confused...

 And the scene re-formed. Harry looked around. He was on platform nine and three quarters, and 
Snape stood beside him, slightly hunched, next to a thin, sallow-faced, sour-looking woman who 
greatly resembled him. Snape was staring at a family of four a short distance away. The two girls 
stood a little apart from their parents. Lily seemed to be pleading with her sister. Harry moved 
closer to listen. 

��... I��m sorry, Tuney, I��m sorry! Listen �C�� She caught her sister��s hand and held tight to it, even 
though Petunia tried to pull it away. ��Maybe once I��m there �C no, listen, Tuney! Maybe once I��m 
there, I��ll be able to go to Professor Dumbledore and persuade him to change his mind!��

��478ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I don��t �C want �C to �C go!�� said Petunia, and she dragged her hand back out of her sister��s 
grasp. ��You think I want to go to some stupid castle and learn to be a �C a...�� 

Her pale eyes roved over the platform, over the cats mewing in their owners�� arms, over the 
owls, fluttering and hooting at each other in cages, over the students, some already in their long 
black robes, loading trunks onto the scarlet steam engine or else greeting one another with glad 
cries after a summer apart.

 ���C you think I want to be a �C a freak?��

 Lily��s eyes filled with tears as Petunia succeeded in tugging her hand away.

 ��I��m not a freak,�� said Lily. ��That��s a horrible thing to say.�� 

��That��s where you��re going,�� said Petunia with relish. ��A special school for freaks. You and 
that Snape boy... weirdos, that��s what you two are. It��s good you��re being separated from normal 
people. It��s for our safety.�� 

Lily glanced toward her parents, who were looking around the platform with an air of 
wholehearted enjoyment, drinking in the scene. Then she looked back at her sister, and her voice 
was low and fierce. 

��You didn��t think it was such a freak��s school when you wrote to the headmaster and begged 

him to take you.��

 Petunia turned scarlet. ��Beg? I didn��t beg!��

 ��I saw his reply. It was very kind.��

 ��You shouldn��t have read �C�� whispered Petunia, ��that was my private �C how could you �C?��

 Lily gave herself away by half-glancing toward where Snape stood nearby. 

Petunia gasped. ��That boy found it! You and that boy have been sneaking in my room!�� 

��No �C not sneaking �C�� Now Lily was on the defensive��������. ��Severus saw the envelope, 
and he couldn��t believe a Muggle could have contacted Hogwarts, that��s all! He says there must be 
wizards working undercover in the postal service who take care of �C�� 

��Apparently wizards poke their noses in everywhere!�� said Petunia, now as pale as she had 
been flushed. ��Freak!�� she spat at her sister, and she flounced off to where her parents stood... 

The scene dissolved again. Snape was hurrying along the corridor of the Hogwarts Express as it 
clattered through the countryside. He had already changed into his school robes, had perhaps taken 
the first opportunity to take off his dreadful Muggle clothes. At last he stopped, outside a

��479ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

compartment in which a group of rowdy��rough, noisy�� boys were talking. Hunched in a corner 
seat beside the window was Lily, her face pressed against the windowpane. 
Snape slid open the compartment door and sat down opposite Lily. She glanced at him and then 

looked back out of the window. She had been crying. 
��I don��t want to talk to you,�� she said in a constricted voice. 
��Why not?�� 
��Tuney h-hates me. Because we saw that letter from Dumbledore.�� 
��So what?�� 
She threw him a look of deep dislike. ��So she��s my sister!�� 
��She��s only a �C�� He caught himself quickly; Lily, too busy trying to wipe her eyes without 

being noticed, did not hear him. 
��But we��re going!�� he said, unable to suppress the exhilaration in his voice. ��This is it! We��re 

off to Hogwarts!�� 
She nodded, mopping her eyes, but in spite of herself, she half smiled. 
��You��d better be in Slytherin,�� said Snape, encouraged that she had brightened a little. 
��Slytherin?�� 
One of the boys sharing the compartment, who had shown no interest at all in Lily or Snape 

until that point, looked around at the word, and Harry, whose attention had been focused entirely 
on the two beside the window, saw his father, slight, black-haired like Snape, but with that 
indefinable air of having been well-cared-for, even adored, that Snape so conspicuously lacked. 

��Who wants to be in Slytherin? I think I��d leave, wouldn��t you?�� James asked the boy lounging 

on the seats opposite him, and with a jolt, Harry realized that it was Sirius. Sirius did not smile. 
��My whole family have been in Slytherin,�� he said. 
��Blimey,�� said James, ��and I thought you seemed all right!�� 
Sirius grinned. ��Maybe I��ll break the tradition. Where are you heading, if you��ve got the 

choice?�� 
James lifted an invisible sword. 
��'Gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' Like my dad.�� 
Snape made a small, disparaging noise. James turned on him. 
��Got a problem with that?��

��480ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No,�� said Snape, though his slight sneer said otherwise. ��If you��d rather be brawny than brainy 

�C��

 ��Where��re you hoping to go, seeing as you��re neither?�� interjected Sirius. 

James roared with laughter. Lily sat up, rather flushed, and looked from James to Sirius in 

dislike.

 ��Come on, Severus, let��s find another compartment.��

 ��Oooooo...��

 James and Sirius imitated her lofty voice; James tried to trip Snape as he passed. 

 ��See ya, Snivellus!�� a voice called, as the compartment door slammed...

 And the scene dissolved once more... 

Harry was standing right behind Snape as they faced the candlelit House tables, lined with rapt 

faces. Then Professor McGonagall said, ��Evans, Lily!�� 

He watched his mother walk forward on trembling legs and sit down upon the rickety stool. 
Professor McGonagall dropped the Sorting Hat onto her head, and barely a second after it had 
touched the dark red hair, the hat cried, ��Gryffindor!�� 

Harry heard Snape let out a tiny groan. Lily took off the hat, handed it back to Professor 
McGonagall, then hurried toward the cheering Gryffindors, but as she went she glanced back at 
Snape, and there was a sad little smile on her face. Harry saw Sirius move up the bench to make 
room for her. She took one look at him, seemed to recognize him from the train, folded her arms, 
and firmly turned her back on him. 

The roll call continued. Harry watched Lupin, Pettigrew, and his father join Lily and Sirius at 
the Gryffindor table. At last, when only a dozen students remained to be sorted, Professor 
McGonagall called Snape. 

Harry walked with him to the stool, watched him place the hat upon his head. 

��Slytherin!�� cried the Sorting Hat. 

And Severus Snape moved off to the other side of the Hall, away from Lily, to where the 
Slytherins were cheering him, to where Lucius Malfoy, a prefect badge gleaming upon his chest, 
patted Snape on the back as he sat down beside him...

 And the scene changed... 

Lily and Snape were walking across the castle courtyard, evidently arguing. Harry hurried to

��481ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

catch up with them, to listen in. As he reached them, he realized how much taller they both were. 

A few years seemed to have passed since their Sorting. 

 ��... thought we were supposed to be friends?�� Snape was saying, ��Best friends?�� 

��We are, Sev, but I don��t like some of the people you��re hanging round with! I��m sorry, but I 

detest Avery and Mulciber! Mulciber! What do you see in him, Sev, he��s creepy! D��you know 

what he tried to do to Mary Macdonald the other day?��

 Lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face. 

 ��That was nothing,�� said Snape. ��It was a laugh, that��s all �C��

 ��It was Dark Magic, and if you think that��s funny �C�� 

��What about the stuff Potter and his mates get up to?�� demanded Snape. His color rose again as 

he said it, unable, it seemed, to hold in his resentment.

 ��What��s Potter got to do with anything?�� said Lily. 

��They sneak out at night. There��s something weird about that Lupin. Where does he keep 

going?��

 ��He��s ill,�� said Lily. ��They say he��s ill �C��

 ��Every month at the full moon?�� said Snape. 

��I know your theory,�� said Lily, and she sounded cold. ��Why are you so obsessed with them 

anyway? Why do you care what they��re doing at night?��

 ��I��m just trying to show you they��re not as wonderful as everyone seems to think they are.��

 The intensity of his gaze made her blush. 

��They don��t use Dark Magic, though.�� She dropped her voice. ��And you��re being really 
ungrateful. I heard what happened the other night. You went sneaking down that tunnel by the 
Whomping Willow, and James Potter saved you from whatever��s down there �C�� 

Snape��s whole face contorted and he spluttered, ��Saved? Saved? You think he was playing the 

hero? He was saving his neck and his friends�� too! You��re not going to �C I won��t let you �C�� 

��Let me? Let me?�� Lily��s bright green eyes were slits. 

Snape backtracked at once. 

��I didn��t mean �C I just don��t want to see you made a fool of ... He fancies you, James Potter 
fancies you!�� The words seemed wrenched from him against his will. ��And he��s not... everyone 
thinks... big Quidditch hero �C�� Snape��s bitterness and dislike were rendering him incoherent, and

��482ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Lily��s eyebrows were traveling farther and farther up her forehead. 

��I know James Potter��s an arrogant toerag,�� she said, cutting across Snape. ��I don��t need you to 
tell me that. But Mulciber��s and Avery��s idea of humor is just evil. Evil, Sev. I don��t understand 
how you can be friends with them.�� 

Harry doubted that Snape had even heard her strictures (criticism) on Mulciber and Avery. The 
moment she had insulted James Potter, his whole body had relaxed, and as they walked away there 
was a new spring in Snape��s step... 

 And the scene dissolved... 

Harry watched again as Snape left the Great Hall after sitting his O.W.L. in Defense Against 
the Dark Arts, watched as he wandered away from the castle and strayed inadvertently close to the 
place beneath the beech tree where James, Sirius, Lupin, and Pettigrew sat together. But Harry 
kept his distance this time, because he knew what happened after James had hoisted Severus into 
the air and taunted him; he knew what had been done and said, and it gave him no pleasure to hear 
it again... He watched as Lily joined the group and went to Snape��s defense. Distantly he heard 
Snape shout at her in his humiliation and his fury, the unforgivable word, ��Mudblood.��

 The scene changed...

 ��I��m sorry.��

 ��I��m not interested.��

 ��I��m sorry!��

 ��Save your breath.��

 It was nighttime. Lily, who was wearing a dressing gown, stood with her arms folded in front of 
the portrait of the Fat Lady, at the entrance to Gryffindor Tower.

 ��I only came out because Mary told me you were threatening to sleep here.��

 ��I was. I would have done. I never meant to call you Mudblood, it just �C�� 

��Slipped out?�� There was no pity in Lily��s voice. ��It��s too late. I��ve made excuses for you for 
years. None of my friends can understand why I even talk to you. You and your precious little 
Death Eater friends �C you see, you don��t even deny it! You don��t even deny that��s what you��re all 
aiming to be! You can��t wait to join You-Know-Who, can you?��

 He opened his mouth, but closed it without speaking.

 ��I can��t pretend anymore. You��ve chosen your way, I��ve chosen mine.��

��483ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No �C listen, I didn��t mean �C�� 

���C to call me Mudblood? But you call everyone of my birth Mudblood, Severus. Why should I 
be any different?��

 He struggled on the verge of speech, but with a contemptuous look she turned and climbed back 
through the portrait hole... 

The corridor dissolved, and the scene took a little longer to reform, Harry seemed to fly through 
shifting shapes and colors until his surroundings solidified again and he stood on a hilltop, forlorn 
and cold in the darkness, the wind whistling through the branches of a few leafless trees. The adult 
Snape was panting, turning on the spot, his wand gripped tightly in his hand, waiting for something 
or for someone... His fear infected Harry too, even though he knew that he could not be harmed, 
and he looked over his shoulder, wondering what it was that Snape was waiting for �C 

Then a blinding, jagged jet of white light flew through the air. Harry thought of lightning, but 

Snape had dropped to his knees and his wand had flown out of his hand.

 ��Don��t kill me!��

 ��That was not my intention.�� 

Any sound of Dumbledore Apparating had been drowned by the sound of the wind in the 

branches. He stood before Snape with his robes whipping around him, and his face was illuminated 

from below in the light cast by his wand. 

 ��Well, Severus? What message does Lord Voldemort have for me?��

 ��No �C no message �C I��m here on my own account!�� 

Snape was wringing his hands. He looked a little mad, with his straggling black hair flying 

around him.

 ��I �C I come with a warning �C no, a request �C please �C�� 

Dumbledore flicked his wand. Though leaves and branches still flew through the night air 

around them, silence fell on the spot where he and Snape faced each other.

 ��What request could a Death Eater make of me?��

 ��The �C the prophecy... the prediction... Trelawney...��

 ��Ah, yes,�� said Dumbledore. ��How much did you relay to Lord Voldemort?�� 

��Everything �C everything I heard!�� said Snape. ��That is why �C it is for that reason �C he thinks it 

means Lily Evans!��

��484ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��The prophecy did not refer to a woman,�� said Dumbledore. ��It spoke of a boy born at the end 
of July �C�� 

��You know what I mean! He thinks it means her son, he is going to hunt her down �C kill them 
all �C�� 

��If she means so much to you,�� said Dumbledore, ��surely Lord Voldemort will spare her? 
Could you not ask for mercy for the mother, in exchange for the son?��

 ��I have �C I have asked him �C�� 

��You disgust me,�� said Dumbledore, and Harry had never heard so much contempt in his voice. 
Snape seemed to shrink a little, ��You do not care, then, about the deaths of her husband and child? 
They can die, as long as you have what you want?�� 

Snape said nothing, but merely looked up at Dumbledore. ��Hide them all, then,�� he croaked. 
��Keep her �C them �C safe. Please.��

 ��And what will you give me in return, Severus?�� 

��In �C in return?�� Snape gaped at Dumbledore, and Harry expected him to protest, but after a 

long moment he said, ��Anything.�� 

The hilltop faded, and Harry stood in Dumbledore��s office, and something was making a 
terrible sound, like a wounded animal. Snape was slumped forward in a chair and Dumbledore was 
standing over him, looking grim. After a moment or two, Snape raised his face, and he looked like 
a man who had lived a hundred years of misery since leaving the wild hilltop.

 ��I thought... you were going... to keep her... safe...�� 

��She and James put their faith in the wrong person,�� said Dumbledore. ��Rather like you, 
Severus. Weren��t you hoping that Lord Voldemort would spare her?��

 Snape��s breathing was shallow. 

 ��Her boy survives,�� said Dumbledore.

 With a tiny jerk of the head, Snape seemed to flick off an irksome fly. 

��Her son lives. He has her eyes, precisely her eyes. You remember the shape and color of Lily 

Evans��s eyes, I am sure?��

 ��DON��T!�� bellowed Snape. ��Gone... dead...��

 ��Is this remorse, Severus?��

 ��I wish... I wish I were dead...��

��485ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��And what use would that be to anyone?�� said Dumbledore coldly. ��If you loved Lily Evans, if 
you truly loved her, then your way forward is clear.�� 

Snape seemed to peer through a haze of pain, and Dumbledore��s words appeared to take a long 
time to reach him.

 ��What �C what do you mean?��

 ��You know how and why she died. Make sure it was not in vain. Help me protect Lily��s son.��

 ��He does not need protection. The Dark Lord has gone �C��

 ��The Dark Lord will return, and Harry Potter will be in terrible danger when he does.�� 

There was a long pause, and slowly Snape regained control of himself, mastered his own 
breathing. At last he said, ��Very well. Very well. But never �C never tell, Dumbledore! This must 
be between us! Swear it! I cannot bear... especially Potter��s son... I want your word!�� 

��My word, Severus, that I shall never reveal the best of you?�� Dumbledore sighed, looking 
down into Snape��s ferocious, anguished face. ��If you insist...�� 

The office dissolved but re-formed instantly. Snape was pacing up and down in front of 
Dumbledore.

 ���C Mediocre, arrogant as his father, a determined rule breaker, delighted to find himself famous, 
attention-seeking and impertinent �C�� 

��You see what you expect to see, Severus,�� said Dumbledore, without raising his eyes from a 
copy of Transfiguration Today. ��Other teachers report that the boy is modest, likable, and 
reasonably talented. Personally, I find him an engaging child.�� 

Dumbledore turned a page, and said, without looking up, ��Keep an eye on Quirrell, won��t 
you?�� 

A whirl of color, and now everything darkened, and Snape and Dumbledore stood a little apart 
in the entrance hall, while the last stragglers from the Yule Ball passed them on their way to bed. 

 ��Well?�� murmured Dumbledore. 

��Karkaroff��s Mark is becoming darker too. He is panicking, he fears retribution; you know how 
much help he gave the Ministry after the Dark Lord fell.�� Snape looked sideways at Dumbledore��s 
crooked-nosed profile. ��Karkaroff intends to flee if the Mark burns.�� 

��Does he?�� said Dumbledore softly, as Fleur Delacour and Roger Davies came giggling in from 
the grounds. ��And are you tempted to join him?��

��486ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��No,�� said Snape, his black eyes on Fleur��s and Roger��s retreating figures. ��I am not such a 
coward.�� 

��No,�� agreed Dumbledore. ��You are a braver man by far than Igor Karkaroff. You know, I 
sometimes think we Sort too soon...��

 He walked away, leaving Snape looking stricken... 

And now Harry stood in the headmaster��s office yet again. It was nighttime, and Dumbledore 
sagged sideways in the thronelike chair behind the desk, apparently semiconscious. His right hand 
dangled over the side, blackened and burned. Snape was muttering incantations, pointing his wand 
at the wrist of the hand, while with his left hand he tipped a goblet full of thick golden potion down 
Dumbledore��s throat. After a moment or two, Dumbledore��s eyelids fluttered and opened. 

��Why,�� said Snape, without preamble, ��why did you put on that ring? It carries a curse, surely 
you realized that. Why even touch it?�� 

Marvolo Gaunt��s ring lay on the desk before Dumbledore. It was cracked; the sword of 
Gryffindor lay beside it.

 Dumbledore grimaced. ��I... was a fool. Sorely tempted...��

 ��Tempted by what?��

 Dumbledore did not answer. 

��It is a miracle you managed to return here!�� Snape sounded furious. ��That ring carried a curse 
of extraordinary power, to contain it is all we can hope for; I have trapped the curse in one hand for 
the time being �C�� 

Dumbledore raised his blackened, useless hand, and examined it with the expression of one 
being shown an interesting curio. 

 ��You have done very well, Severus. How long do you think I have?�� 

Dumbledore��s tone was conversational; he might have been asking for a weather forecast. 
Snape hesitated, and then said, ��I cannot tell. Maybe a year. There is no halting such a spell 
forever. It will spread eventually, it is the sort of curse that strengthens over time.�� 

Dumbledore smiled. The news that he had less than a year to live seemed a matter of little or no 
concern to him. ��I am fortunate, extremely fortunate, that I have you, Severus.�� 

��If you had only summoned me a little earlier, I might have been able to do more, buy you 
more time!�� said Snape furiously. He looked down at the broken ring and the sword. ��Did you

��487ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

think that breaking the ring would break the curse?�� 

��Something like that... I was delirious, no doubt...�� said Dumbledore. With an effort he 
straightened himself in his chair. ��Well, really, this makes matters much more straightforward.�� 

Snape looked utterly perplexed. 

Dumbledore smiled. ��I refer to the plan Lord Voldemort is revolving around me. His plan to 

have the poor Malfoy boy murder me.�� 

Snape sat down in the chair Harry had so often occupied, across the desk from Dumbledore. 
Harry could tell that he wanted to say more on the subject of Dumbledore��s cursed hand, but the 
other held it up in polite refusal to discuss the matter further. 

Scowling, Snape said, ��The Dark Lord does not expect Draco to succeed. This is merely 
punishment for Lucius��s recent failures. Slow torture for Draco��s parents, while they watch him 
fail and pay the price.�� 

��In short, the boy has had a death sentence pronounced upon him as surely as I have,�� said 
Dumbledore. ��Now, I should have thought the natural successor to the job, once Draco fails, is 
yourself?��

 There was a short pause. 

 ��That, I think, is the Dark Lord��s plan.�� 

��Lord Voldemort foresees a moment in the near future when he will not need a spy at 
Hogwarts?��

 ��He believes the school will soon be in his grasp, yes.�� 

��And if it does fall into his grasp,�� said Dumbledore, almost, it seemed, as an aside�԰�, ��I 
have your word that you will do all in your power to protect the students at Hogwarts?��

 Snape gave a stiff nod. 

��Good. Now then. Your first priority will be to discover what Draco is up to. A frightened 

teenage boy is a danger to others as well as to himself. Offer him help and guidance, he ought to 

accept, he likes you �C��

 ���C much less since his father has lost favor.�� 

��All the same, try. I am concerned less for myself than for accidental victims of whatever 
schemes might occur to the boy. Ultimately, of course, there is only one thing to be done if we are 
to save him from Lord Voldemort��s wrath.��

��488ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Snape raised his eyebrows and his tone was sardonic as he asked, ��Are you intending to let him 

kill you?��

 ��Certainly not. You must kill me.�� 

There was a long silence, broken only by an odd clicking noise. Fawkes the phoenix was 
gnawing a bit of cuttleboneī���. 

��Would you like me to do it now?�� asked Snape, his voice heavy with irony. ��Or would you 
like a few moments to compose an epitaphĹ־��;����?�� 

��Oh, not quite yet,�� said Dumbledore, smiling. ��I daresay the moment will present itself in due 
course. Given what has happened tonight,�� he indicated his withered hand, ��we can be sure that it 
will happen within a year.��

 ��If you don��t mind dying,�� said Snape roughly, ��why not let Draco do it?�� 

��That boy��s soul is not yet so damaged,�� said Dumbledore. ��I would not have it ripped apart on 
my account.��

 ��And my soul, Dumbledore? Mine?�� 

��You alone know whether it will harm your soul to help an old man avoid pain and 
humiliation,�� said Dumbledore. ��I ask this one great favor of you, Severus, because death is 
coming for me as surely as the Chudley Cannons will finish bottom of this year��s league. I confess 
I should prefer a quick, painless exit to the protracted and messy affair it will be if, for instance, 
Greyback is involved �C I hear Voldemort has recruited him? Or dear Bellatrix, who likes to play 
with her food before she eats it.�� 

His tone was light, but his blue eyes pierced Snape as they had frequently pierced Harry, as 

though the soul they discussed was visible to him. At last Snape gave another curt nod. 

 Dumbledore seemed satisfied. ��Thank you, Severus...�� 

The office disappeared, and now Snape and Dumbledore were strolling together in the deserted 
castle grounds by twilight. 

��What are you doing with Potter, all these evenings you are closeted together?�� Snape asked 
abruptly.

 Dumbledore looked weary. 

��Why? You aren��t trying to give him more detentions, Severus? The boy will soon have spent 

more time in detention than out.��

��489ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��He is his father over again �C�� 

��In looks, perhaps, but his deepest nature is much more like his mother��s. I spend time with 
Harry because I have things to discuss with him, information I must give him before it is too late.��

 ��Information,�� repeated Snape. ��You trust him... you do not trust me.�� 

��It is not a question of trust. I have, as we both know, limited time. It is essential that I give the 

boy enough information for him to do what he needs to do.��

 ��And why may I not have the same information?�� 

��I prefer not to put all of my secrets in one basket, particularly not a basket that spends so much 

time dangling on the arm of Lord Voldemort.��

 ��Which I do on your orders!�� 

��And you do it extremely well. Do not think that I underestimate the constant danger in which 
you place yourself, Severus. To give Voldemort what appears to be valuable information while 
withholding the essentials is a job I would entrust to nobody but you.�� 

��Yet you confide much more in a boy who is incapable of Occlumency, whose magic is 
mediocre, and who has a direct connection into the Dark Lord��s mind!�� 

��Voldemort fears that connection,�� said Dumbledore. ��Not so long ago he had one small taste 
of what truly sharing Harry��s mind means to him. It was pain such as he has never experienced. He 
will not try to possess Harry again, I am sure of it. Not in that way.��

 ��I don��t understand.�� 

��Lord Voldemort��s soul, maimed as it is, cannot bear close contact with a soul like Harry��s. 
Like a tongue on frozen steel, like flesh in flame �C��

 ��Souls? We were talking of minds!��

 ��In the case of Harry and Lord Voldemort, to speak of one is to speak of the other.�� 

Dumbledore glanced around to make sure that they were alone. They were close by the 

Forbidden Forest now, but there was no sign of anyone near them.

 ��After you have killed me, Severus �C�� 

��You refuse to tell me everything, yet you expect that small service of me!�� snarled Snape, and 
real anger flared in the thin face now. ��You take a great deal for granted, Dumbledore! Perhaps I 
have changed my mind!�� 

��You gave me your word, Severus. And while we are talking about services you owe me, I

��490ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

thought you agreed to keep a close eye on our young Slytherin friend?��

 Snape looked angry, mutinous. 

Dumbledore sighed. ��Come to my office tonight, Severus, at eleven, and you shall not 
complain that I have no confidence in you...�� 

They were back in Dumbledore��s office, the windows dark, and Fawkes sat silent as Snape sat 
quite still, as Dumbledore walked around him, talking. 

��Harry must not know, not until the last moment, not until it is necessary, otherwise how could 
he have the strength to do what must be done?��

 ��But what must he do?�� 

��That is between Harry and me. Now listen closely, Severus. There will come a time �C after my 

death �C do not argue, do not interrupt! There will come a time when Lord Voldemort will seem to 

fear for the life of his snake.��

 ��For Nagini?�� Snape looked astonished. 

��Precisely. If there comes a time when Lord Voldemort stops sending that snake forth to do his 

bidding, but keeps it safe beside him under magical protection, then, I think, it will be safe to tell 

Harry.��

 ��Tell him what?��

 Dumbledore took a deep breath and closed his eyes. ��Tell him that on the night Lord Voldemort 
tried to kill him, when Lily cast her own life between them as a shield, the Killing Curse 
rebounded upon Lord Voldemort, and a fragment of Voldemort��s soul was blasted apart from the 
whole, and latched (fasten) itself onto the only living soul left in that collapsed building. Part of 
Lord Voldemort lives inside Harry, and it is that which gives him the power of speech with snakes, 
and a connection with Lord Voldemort��s mind that he has never understood. And while that 
fragment of soul, unmissed by Voldemort, remains attached to and protected by Harry, Lord 
Voldemort cannot die.�� 

Harry seemed to be watching the two men from one end of a long tunnel, they were so far away 

from him, their voices echoing strangely in his ears. 

 ��So the boy... the boy must die?�� asked Snape quite calmly.

 ��And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.�� 

Another long silence. Then Snape said, ��I thought... all those years... that we were protecting

��491ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

him for her. For Lily.�� 

��We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let him try 
his strength,�� said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. ��Meanwhile, the connection between them 
grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth. Sometimes I have thought he suspects it himself. If I know 
him, he will have arranged matters so that when he does set out to meet his death, it will truly 
mean the end of Voldemort.��

 Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified.

 ��You have kept him alive so that he can die at the right moment?��

 ��Don��t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?��

 ��Lately, only those whom I could not save,�� said Snape. He stood up. ��You have used me.��

 ��Meaning?�� 

��I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything was 
supposed to be to keep Lily Potter��s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising him like a 
pig for slaughter �C�� 

��But this is touching, Severus,�� said Dumbledore seriously. ��Have you grown to care for the 
boy, after all?��

 ��For him?�� shouted Snape. ��Expecto Patronum!�� 

From the tip of his wand burst the silver doe. She landed on the office floor, bounded once 

across the office, and soared out of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her 

silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. 

 ��After all this time?��

 ��Always,�� said Snape. 

And the scene shifted. Now, Harry saw Snape talking to the portrait of Dumbledore behind his 

desk. 

��You will have to give Voldemort the correct date of Harry��s departure from his aunt and 
uncle��s,�� said Dumbledore. ��Not to do so will raise suspicion, when Voldemort believes you so 
well informed. However, you must plant the idea of decoys; that, I think, ought to ensure Harry��s 
safety. Try Confunding Mundungus Fletcher. And Severus, if you are forced to take part in the 
chase, be sure to act your part convincingly... I am counting upon you to remain in Lord 
Voldemort��s good books as long as possible, or Hogwarts will be left to the mercy of the

��492ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Carrows...�� 

Now Snape was head to head with Mundungus in an unfamiliar tavern, Mundungus��s face 
looking curiously blank, Snape frowning in concentration. 

��You will suggest to the Order of the Phoenix,�� Snape murmured, ��that they use decoys. 
Polyjuice Potion. Identical Potters. It��s the only thing that might work. You will forget that I have 
suggested this. You will present it as your own idea. You understand?��

 ��I understand,�� murmured Mundungus, his eyes unfocused... 

Now Harry was flying alongside Snape on a broomstick through a clear dark night. He was 
accompanied by other hooded Death Eaters, and ahead were Lupin and a Harry who was really 
George... A Death Eater moved ahead of Snape and raised his wand, pointing it directly at Lupin��s 
back.

 ��Sectumsempra!�� shouted Snape. 

 But the spell, intended for the Death Eater��s wand hand, missed and hit George instead �C 

And next, Snape was kneeling in Sirius��s old bedroom. Tears were dripping from the end of his 
hooked nose as he read the old letter from Lily. The second page carried only a few words, 

could ever have been friends with Gellert Grindelwald. I think her mind��s going, 
personally! 
Lots of love, 
Lily 

Snape took the page bearing Lily��s signature, and her love, and tucked it inside his robes. Then 
he ripped in two the photograph he was also holding, so that he kept the part from which Lily 
laughed, throwing the portion showing James and Harry back onto the floor, under the chest of 
drawers... 

And now Snape stood again in the headmaster��s study as Phineas Nigellus came hurrying into 

his portrait.

 ��Headmaster! They are camping in the Forest of Dean! The Mudblood �C��

 ��Do not use that word!��

 ���C the Granger girl, then, mentioned the place as she opened her bag and I heard her!�� 

��Good. Very good!�� cried the portrait of Dumbledore behind the headmaster��s chair. ��Now, 

Severus, the sword! Do not forget that it must be taken under conditions of need and valor �C and he

��493ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

must not know that you give it! If Voldemort should read Harry��s mind and see you acting for him 
�C�� 

��I know,�� said Snape curtly. He approached the portrait of Dumbledore and pulled at its side. It 
swung forward, revealing a hidden cavity behind it from which he took the sword of Gryffindor. 

��And you still aren��t going to tell me why it��s so important to give Potter the sword?�� said 
Snape as he swung a traveling cloak over his robes. 

��No, I don��t think so,�� said Dumbledore��s portrait. ��He will know what to do with it. And 
Severus, be very careful, they may not take kindly to your appearance after George Weasley��s 
mishap �C��

 Snape turned at the door. 

 ��Don��t worry, Dumbledore,�� he said coolly. ��I have a plan...�� 

And Snape left the room. Harry rose up out of the Pensieve, and moments later he lay on the 
carpeted floor in exactly the same room Snape might just have closed the door.

Chapter Thirty-Four 
The Forest Again 


Finally, the truth. Lying with his face

Along the

himself 

across Voldemort��s path, and did not raise a wand to defend himself, the end would be clean, and 
the job that ought to have been done in Godric��s Hollow would be finished. Neither would live, 
neither could survive. 

He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of death, it 
pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats 
were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for 
the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest? 

Terror washed over him as he lay on the floor, with that funeral drum pounding inside him. 
Would it hurt to die? All those times he had thought that it was about to happen and escaped, he 
had never really thought of the thing itself. His will to live had always been so much stronger than 
his fear of death. Yet it did not occur to him now to try to escape, to outrun Voldemort. It was 
over, he knew it, and all that was left was the thing itself, dying. 

If he could only have died on that summer��s night when he had left number four, Privet Drive, 
for the last time, when the noble phoenix feather wand had saved him! If he could only have died 
like Hedwig, so quickly he would not have known it had happened! Or if he could have launched 
himself in front of a wand to save someone he loved ... He envied even his parents�� deaths now. 
This cold-blooded walk to his own destruction would require a different kind of bravery. He felt 
his fingers trembling slightly and made an effort to control them, although no one could see him; 
the portraits on the walls were all empty. 

Slowly, very slowly, he sat up, and as he did so he felt more alive and more aware of his own

living body than ever before. Why had he never appreciated what a miracle he was, brain and 
nerve and pounding heart? It would all be gone ... or at least, he would be gone from it. His breath 
came slow and deep, and his mouth and throat were completely dry, but so were his eyes. 

Dumbledore��s betrayal was almost nothing. Of course there had been a bigger plan, Harry had 
simply been too foolish to see it, he realized that now. He had never questioned his own 
assumption that Dumbledore wanted him alive. Now he saw that his life span had always been 
determined by how long it took to eliminate all the Horcruxes. Dumbledore had passed the job of 
destroying them to him, and obediently he had continued to chip away at the bonds tying not only 
Voldemort, but himself, to life! How neat, how elegant, not to waste any more lives, but to give the 
dangerous task to the boy who had already been marked for slaughter, and whose death would not 
be a calamity, but another blow against Voldemort. 

And Dumbledore had known that Harry would not duck out, that he would keep going to the 
end, even though it was his end, because he had taken trouble to get to know him, hadn��t he? 
Dumbledore knew, as Voldemort knew, that Harry would not let anyone else die for him now that 
he had discovered it was in his power to stop it. The images of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks lying dead 
in the Great Hall forced their way back into his mind��s eye, and for a moment he could hardly 
breathe. Death was impatient ... 

But Dumbledore had overestimated him. He had failed. The snake survived. One Horcrux 
remained to bind Voldemort to the earth, even after Harry had been killed. True, that would mean 
an easier job for somebody. He wondered who would do it ... Ron and Hermione would know what 
needed to be done, of course ... That would have been why Dumbledore wanted him to confide in 
two others ... so that if he fulfilled his true destiny a little early, they could carry on ... 

Like rain on a cold window, these thoughts pattered against the hard surface of the 
incontrovertible truth, which was that he must die. I must die. It must end. 

Ron and Hermione seemed a long way away, in a far-off country; he felt as though he had 
parted from them long ago. There would be no good-byes and no explanations, he was determined 
of that. This was a journey they could not take together, and the attempts they would make to stop 
him would waste valuable time. He looked down at the battered gold watch he had received on his 
seventeenth birthday. Nearly half of the hour allotted by Voldemort for his surrender had elapsed.

He stood up. His heart was leaping against his ribs like a frantic bird. Perhaps it knew it had 
little time left, perhaps it was determined to fulfill a lifetime��s beats before the end. He did not 
look back as he closed the office door. 

The castle was empty. He felt ghostly striding through it alone, as if he had already died. The 
portrait people were still missing from their frames; the whole place was eerily still, as if all its 
remaining lifeblood were concentrated in the Great Hall where the dead and the mourners were 
crammed. 

Harry pulled the Invisibility Cloak over himself and descended through the floors, at last 
walking down the marble staircase into the entrance hall. Perhaps some tiny part of him hoped to 
be sensed, to be seen, to be stopped, but the Cloak was, as ever, impenetrable, perfect, and he 
reached the front doors easily. 

Then Neville nearly walked into him. He was one half of a pair that was carrying a body in 
from the grounds. Harry glanced down and felt another dull blow to his stomach, Colin Creevey, 
though underage, must have sneaked back just as Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had done. He was 
tiny in death. 

��You know what? I can manage him alone, Neville,�� said Oliver Wood, and he heaved Colin 
over his shoulder in a fireman��s lift and carried him into the Great Hall. 

Neville leaned against the door frame for a moment and wiped his forehead with the back of his 
hand. He looked like an old man. Then he set off on the steps again into the darkness to recover 
more bodies. 

Harry took one glance back at the entrance of the Great Hall. People were moving around, 
trying to comfort each other, drinking, kneeling beside the dead, but he could not see any of the 
people he loved, no hint of Hermione, Ron, Ginny, or any of the other Weasleys, no Luna. He felt 
he would have given all the time remaining to him for just one last look at them; but then, would 
he ever have the strength to stop looking? It was better like this. 

He moved down the steps and out into the darkness. It was nearly four in the morning, and the 
deathly stillness of the grounds felt as though they were holding their breath, waiting to see 
whether he could do what he must.

 Harry moved toward Neville, who was bending over another body.

 ��Neville.��

��Blimey, Harry, you nearly gave me heart failure!�� 

Harry had pulled off the Cloak. The idea had come to him out of nowhere, born out of a desire 
to make absolutely sure.

 ��Where are you going, alone?�� Neville asked suspiciously.

 ��It��s all part of the plan,�� said Harry. ��There��s someting I��ve got to do. Listen - Neville -�� 

��Harry!�� Neville looked suddenly scared. ��Harry, you��re not thinking of handing yourself 
over?�� 

��No,�� Harry lied easily. ��'Course not ... this is something else. But I might be out of sight for a 
while. You know Voldemort��s snake. Neville? He��s got a huge snake ... Calls it Nagini ...��

 ��I��ve heard, yeah ... What about it?��

 ��It��s got to be killed. Ron and Hermione know that, but just in case they -�� 

The awfulness of that possibility smothered him for a moment, made it impossible to keep 
talking. But he pulled himself together again. This was crucial, he must be like Dumbledore, keep 
a cool head, make sure there were backups, others to carry on. Dumbledore had died knowing that 
three people still knew about the Horcruxes; now Neville would take Harry��s place. There would 
still be three in the secret.

 ��Just in case they��re - busy - and you get the chance -��

 ��Kill the snake?��

 ��Kill the snake,�� Harry repeated.

 ��All right, Harry. You��re okay, are you?��

 ��I��m fine. Thanks, Neville.��

 But Neville seized his wrist as Harry made to move on. 

 ��We��re all going to keep fighting, Harry. You know that?��

 ��Yeah, I -�� 

The suffocating feeling extinguished the end of the sentence; he could not go on. Neville did 
not seem to find it strange. He patted Harry on the shoulder, released him, and walked away to 
look for more bodies. 

Harry swung the Cloak back over himself and walked on. Someone else was moving not far 
away, stooping over another prone figure on the ground. He was feet away from her when he 
realized it was Ginny.

��498ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He stopped in his tracks. She was crouching over a girl who was whispering for her mother.

 ��It��s all right,�� Ginny was saying. ��It��s ok. We��re going to get you inside.��

 ��But I want to go home,�� whispered the girl. ��I don��t want to fight anymore!��

 ��I know,�� said Ginny, and her voice broke. ��It��s going to be all right.�� 

Ripples of cold undulated (cause to move in waves) over Harry��s skin. He wanted to shout out 
to the night, he wanted Ginny to know that he was there, he wanted her to know where he was 
going. He wanted to be stopped, to be dragged back, to be sent back home... 

But he was home. Hogwards was the first and best home he had known. He and Voldemort and 
Snape, the abandoned boys, had all found home here. 

Ginny was kneeling beside the injured girl now, holding her hand. With a huge effort Harry 
forced himself on. He thought he saw Ginny look around as he passed, and wondered whether she 
had sensed someone walking nearby, but he did not speak, and he did not look back. 

Hagrid��s hut loomed out of the darkness. There were no lights, no sound of Fang scrabbling at 
the door, his bark booming in welcome. All those visits to Hagrid, and the gleam of the copper 
kettle on the fire, and rock cakes and giant grubs, and his great bearded face, and Ron vomiting 
slugs, and Hermione helping him save Norbert ... 

 He moved on, and now he reached the edge of the forest, and he stopped. 

A swarm of dementors was gliding amongst the trees; he could feel their chill, and he was not 
sure he would be able to pass safely through it. He had not strength left for a Patronus. He could no 
longer control his own trembling. It was not, after all, so easy to die. Every second he breathed, the 
smell of the grass, the cool air on his face, was so precious. To think that people had years and 
years, time to waste, so much time it dragged, and he was clinging to each second. At the same 
time he thought that he would not be able to go on, and knew that he must. The long game was 
ended, the Snitch had been caught, it was time to leave the air. 

The Snitch. His nerveless fingers fumbled for a moment with the pouch at his neck and he 
pulled it out. 

I open at the close. 

Breathing fast and hard, he stared down at it. Now that he wanted time to move as slowly as 
possible, it seemed to have sped up, and understanding was coming so fast it seemed to have 
bypassed thought. This was the close. This was the moment.

��499ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

He pressed the golden metal to his lips and whispered, ��I am about to die.�� 

The metal shell broke open. He lowered his shaking hand, raised Draco��s wand beneath the 
Cloak, and murmured, ��Lumos.�� 

The black stone with is jagged crack running down the center sat in the two halves of the 
Snitch. The Resurrection Stone had cracked down the vertical line representing the Elder Wand. 
The triangle and circle representing the Cloak and the stone were still discernible. 

And again Harry understood without having to think. It did not matter about bringing them 

back, for he was about to join them. He was not really fetching them. They were fetching him.

 He closed his eyes and turned the stone over in his hand three times. 

He knew it had happened, because he heard slight movements around him that suggested frail 
bodies shifting their footing on the earthy, twig-strewn ground that marked the outer edge of the 
forest. He opened his eyes and looked around. 

They were neither ghost nor truly flesh, he could see that. They resembled most closely the 
Riddle that had escaped from the diary so long ago, and he had been memory made nearly solid. 
Less substantial than living bodies, but much more than ghosts, they moved toward him. And on 
each face, there was the same loving smile. 

James was exactly the same height as Harry. He was wearing the clothes in which he had died, 
and his hair was untidy and ruffled, and his glasses were a little lopsided, like Mr. Weasley��s. 

Sirius was tall and handsome, and younger by far than Harry had seen him in life. He loped 
(move with a fast relaxed stride) with an easy grace, his hands in his pockets and a grin on his face. 

Lupin was younger too, and much less shabby, and his hair was thicker and darker. He looked 
happy to be back in this familiar place, scene of so many adolescent wanderings. 

Lily��s smile was widest of all. She pushed her long hair back as she drew closer to him, and her 
green eyes, so like his, searched his face hungrily, as though she would never be able to look at 
him enough. 

 ��You��ve been so brave.��

 He could not speak. His eyes feasted on her, and he thought that he would like to stand and look 
at her forever, and that would be enough. 

 ��You are nearly there,�� said James. ��Very close. We are so proud of you.��

 ��Does it hurt?��

��500ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

The childish question had fallen from Harry��s lips before he could stop it.

 ��Dying? Not at all,�� said Sirius. ��Quicker and easier than falling asleep.��

 ��And he will want it to be quick. He wants it over,�� said Lupin.

 ��I didn��t want you to die,�� Harry said. These words came without his volition. ��Any of you. I��m 
sorry -�� 

He addressed Lupin more than any of them, beseeching him. ��-right after you��d had your 
son ... Remus, I��m sorry.�� 

��I am sorry too,�� said Lupin. ��Sorry I will never know him ... but he will know why I died and I 
hope he will understand. I was trying to make a world in which he could live a happier life.�� 

A chilly breeze that seemed to emanate from the heart of the forest lifted the hair at Harry��s 
brow. He knew that they would not tell him to go, that it would have to be his decision. 

 ��You��ll stay with me?��

 ��Until the very end,�� said James.

 ��They won��t be able to see you?�� asked Harry.

 ��We are part of you,�� said Sirius. ��Invisible to anyone else.��

 Harry looked at his mother.

 ��Stay close to me,�� he said quietly. 

And he set off. The dementors�� chill did not overcome him; he passed through it with his 
companions, and they acted like Patronuses to him, and together they marched through the old 
trees that grew closely together, their branches tangled, their roots gnarled and twisted underfoot. 
Harry clutched the Cloak tightly around him in the darkness, traveling deeper and deeper into the 
forest, with no idea where exactly Voldemort was, but sure that he would find him. Beside him, 
making scarcely a sound, walked James, Sirius, Lupin, and Lily, and their presence was his 
courage, and the reason he was able to keep putting one foot in front of the other. 

His body and mind felt oddly disconnected now, his limbs working without conscious 
instruction, as if he were passenger, not driver, in the body he was about to leave. The dead who 
walked beside him through the forest were much more real to him now than the living back at the 
castle, Ron, Hermione, Ginny, and all the others were the ones who felt like ghosts as he stumbled 
and slipped toward the end of his life, toward Voldemort ... 

A thud and a whisper. Some other living creature had stirred close by. Harry stopped under the

��501ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Cloak, peering around, listening, and his mother and father, Lupin and Sirius stopped too. 

��Someone there,�� came a rough whisper close at hand. ��He��s got an Invisibility Cloak. Could it 
be -?�� 

Two figures emerged from behind a nearby tree, their wands flared, and Harry saw Yaxley and 
Dolohov peering into the darkness, directly at the place Harry, his mother and father and Sirius and 
Lupin stood. Apparently they could not see anything.

 ��Definitely heard something,�� said Yaxley. ��Animal, d��you reckon?�� 

��That head case Hagrid kept a whole bunch of stuff in here,�� said Dolohov, glancing over his 
shoulder.

 Yaxley looked down at his watch. 

 ��Time��s nearly up. Porter��s had his hour. He��s not coming.��

 ��Better go back,�� said Yaxley. ��Find out what the plan is now.�� 

He and Dolohov turned and walked deeper into the forest. Harry followed them, knowing that 
they would lead him exactly where he wanted to go. He glanced sideways, and his mother smiled 
at him, and his father nodded encouragement. 

They had traveled on mere minutes when Harry saw light ahead, and Yaxley and Dolohov 
stepped out into a clearing that Harry knew had been the place where the monstrous Aragog had 
once lived. The remnants of his vast web were there still, but the swarms of descendants he had 
spawned had been driven out by the Death Eaters, to fight for their cause. 

A fire burned in the middle of the clearing, and its flickering light fell over a crowd of 
completely silent, watchful Death Eaters. Some of them were still masked and hooded; others 
showed their faces. Two giants sat on the outskirts of the group, casting massive shadows over the 
scene, their faces cruel, rough-hewn like rock. Harry saw Fenrir, skulking, chewing his long nails; 
the great blond Rowle was dabbing at his bleeding lip. He saw Lucius Malfoy, who looked 
defeated and terrified, and Narcissa, whose eyes were sunken and full of apprehension. 

Every eye was fixed upon Voldemort, who stood with his head bowed, and his white hands 
folded over the Elder Wand in front of him. He might have been praying, or else counting silently 
in his mind, and Harry, standing still on the edge of the scene, thought absurdly of a child counting 
in a game of hide-and-seek. Behind his head, still swirling and coiling, the great snake Nagini 
floated in her glittering, charmed cage, like a monstrous halo.

��502ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

When Dolohov and Yaxley rejoined the circle, Voldemort looked up. 

 ��No sign of him, my Lord,�� said Dolohov. 

Voldemort��s expression did not change. The red eyes seemed to burn in the firelight. Slowly he 
drew the Elder Wand between his long fingers. 

 ��My Lord -�� 

Bellatrix had spoken. She sat closest to Voldemort, disheveled, her face a little bloody but 
otherwise unharmed. 

Voldemort raised his hand to silence her, and she did not speak another word, but eyed him in 
worshipful fascination. 

��I thought he would come,�� said Voldemort in his high, clear voice, his eyes on the leaping 
flames. ��I expected him to come.�� 

Nobody spoke. They seemed as scared as Harry, whose heart was now throwing itself against 
his ribs as though determined to escape the body he was about to cast aside. His hands were 
sweating as he pulled off the Invisibility Cloak and stuffed it beneath his robes, with his wand. He 
did not want to be tempted to fight. 

 ��I was, it seems ... mistaken,�� said Voldemort.

 ��You weren��t.�� 

Harry said it as loudly as he could, with all the force he could muster. He did not want to sound 
afraid. The Resurrection Stone slipped from between his numb fingers, and out of the corner of his 
eyes he saw his parents, Sirius, and Lupin vanish as he stepped forward into the firelight. At that 
moment he felt that nobody mattered but Voldemort. It was just the two of them. 

The illusion was gone as soon as it had come. The giants roared as the Death Eaters rose 
together, and there were many cries, gasps, even laughter. Voldemort had frozen where he stood, 
but his red eyes had found Harry, and he stared as Harry moved toward him, with nothing but the 
fire between them.

 Then a voice yelled, ��HARRY! NO!�� 

He turned. Hagrid was bound and trussed, tied to a tree nearby. His massive body shook the 
branches overhead as he struggled, desperate.

 ��NO! NO! HARRY, WHAT��RE YEH - ?��

 ��QUIET!�� shouted Rowle, and with a flick of his wand, Hagrid was silenced.

��503ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Bellatrix, who had leapt to her feet, was looking eagerly from Voldemort to Harry, her breast 
heaving. The only things that moved were the flames and the snake, coiling and uncoiling in the 
glittering cage behind Voldemort��s head.

 Harry could feel his wand against his chest, but he made no attempt to draw it. He knew that the 
snake was too well protected, knew that if he managed to point the wand at Nagini, fifty curses 
would hit him first. And still, Voldemort and Harry looked at each other, and now Voldemort tilted 
his head a little to the side, considering the boy standing before him, and a singularly mirthless 
smile curled the lipless mouth. 

��Harry Potter,�� he said very softly. His voice might have been part of the spitting fire. ��The 
Boy Who Lived.�� 

None of the Death Eaters moved. They were waiting, Everything was waiting. Hagrid was 
struggling, and Bellatrix was panting, and Harry thought inexplicably of Ginny, and her blazing 
look, and the feel of her lips on his... 

Voldemort had raised his wand. His head was still tilted to one side, like a curious child, 
wondering what would happen if he proceeded. Harry looked back into the red eyes, and wanted it 
to happen now, quickly, while he could still stand, before he lost control, before he betrayed fear...

 He saw the mouth move and a flash of green light, and everything was gone.

Chapter Thirty-Five 
King's Cross 


He lay facedown, listening to the silence. He was 


perfectly 
alone. Nobody was watching. Nobody else was there. He 

was not 
perfectly sure that he was there himself. 
A long time later, or maybe no time at all, it came to 

him that he 
must exist, must be more than disembodied thought, because he 

was lying, definitely lying, on some surface. Therefore he had a sense of touch, and the thing 
against which he lay existed too. 

Almost as soon as he had reached this conclusion, Harry became conscious that he was naked. 
Convinced as he was of his total solitude, this did not concern him, but it did intrigue him slightly. 
He wondered whether, as he could feel, he would be able to see. In opening them, he discovered 
that he had eyes. 

He lay in a bright mist, though it was not like mist he had ever experienced before. His 
surroundings were not hidden by cloudy vapor; rather the cloudy vapor had not yet formed into 
surroundings. The floor on which he lay seemed to be white, neither warm nor cold, but simply 
there, a flat, blank something on which to be. 

He sat up. His body appeared unscathed. He touched his face. He was not wearing glasses 
anymore.

 Then a noise reached him through the unformed nothingness that surrounded him, the small soft 
thumpings of something that flapped, flailed, and struggled. It was a pitiful noise, yet also slightly 
indecent. He had the uncomfortable feeling that he was eavesdropping on something furtive, 
shameful.

 For the first time, he wished he were clothed. 

Barely had the wish formed in his head than robes appeared a short distance away. He took 
them and pulled them on. They were soft, clean, and warm. It was extraordinary how they had 
appeared just like that, the moment he had wanted them. 

He stood up, looking around. Was he in some great Room of Requirement? The longer he 
looked, the more there was to see. A great domed glass roof glittered high above him in sunlight.

��505ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Perhaps it was a palace. All was hushed and still, except for those odd thumping and whimpering 
noises coming from somewhere close by in the mist. 

Harry turned slowly on the spot, and his surroundings seemed to invent themselves before his 
eyes. A wide-open space, bright and clean, a hall larger by far than the Great Hall, with that clear 
domed glass ceiling. It was quite empty. He was the only person there, except for �C 

He recoiled. He had spotted the thing that was making the noises. It had the form of a small, 
naked child, curled on the ground, its skin raw and rough, flayed��Ƥ 
-looking, and it lay 
shuddering under a seat where it had been left, unwanted, stuffed out of sight, struggling for 
breath. 

He was afraid of it. Small and fragile and wounded though it was, he did not want to approach 
it. Nevertheless he drew slowly nearer, ready to jump back at any moment. Soon he stood near 
enough to touch it, yet he could not bring himself to do it. He felt like a coward. He ought to 
comfort it, but it repulsed him.

 ��You cannot help.�� 

He spun around. Albus Dumbledore was walking toward him, sprightly���õ� and upright, 
wearing sweeping robes of midnight blue. 

��Harry.�� He spread his arms wide, and his hands were both whole and white and undamaged. 
��You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk.�� 

Stunned, Harry followed as Dumbledore strode away from where the flayed child lay 
whimpering, leading him to two seats that Harry had not previously noticed, set some distance 
away under that high, sparkling ceiling. Dumbledore sat down in one of them, and Harry fell into 
the other, staring at his old headmaster��s face. Dumbledore��s long silver hair and beard, the 
piercingly blue eyes behind half-moon spectacles, the crooked nose, everything was as he had 
remembered it. And yet ... 

 ��But you��re dead,�� said Harry.

 ��Oh yes,�� said Dumbledore matter-of-factly.

 ��Then ... I��m dead too?�� 

��Ah,�� said Dumbledore, smiling still more broadly. ��That is the question, isn��t it? On the 
whole, dear boy, I think not.��

 They looked at each other, the old man still beaming.

��506ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Not?�� repeated Harry.

 ��Not,�� said Dumbledore. 

��But...�� Harry raised his hand instinctively toward the lightning scar. It did not seem to be 
there. ��But I should have died �C I didn��t defend myself! I meant to let him kill me!��

 ��And that,�� said Dumbledore, ��will, I think, have made all the difference.�� 

Happiness seemed to radiate from Dumbledore like light; like fire, Harry had never seen the 

man so utterly, so palpably content.

 ��Explain,�� said Harry.

 ��But you already know,�� said Dumbledore. He twiddled his thumbs together.

 ��I let him kill me,�� said Harry. ��Didn��t I?��

 ��You did,�� said Dumbledore, nodding. ��Go on!��

 ��So the part of his soul that was in me ...�� 

Dumbledore nodded still more enthusiastically, urging Harry onward, a broad smile of 

encouragement on his face.

 ��... has it gone?�� 

��Oh yes!�� said Dumbledore. ��Yes, he destroyed it. Your soul is whole, and completely your 
own, Harry.�� 

��But then ...�� Harry trembled over his shoulder to where the small, maimed creature trembled 
under the chair. ��What is that, Professor?��

 ��Something that is beyond either of our help,�� said Dumbledore. 

��But if Voldemort used the Killing Curse,�� Harry started again, ��and nobody died for me this 
time �C how can I be alive?�� 

��I think you know,�� said Dumbledore. ��Think back. Remember what he did, in his ignorance, 
in his greed and his cruelty.�� 

Harry thought. He let his gaze drift over his surroundings. If it was indeed a palace in which 
they sat, it was an odd one, with chairs set in little rows and bits of railing here and there, and still, 
he and Dumbledore and the stunted�谭 
...�ķ���creatures under the chair were the only beings 
there. Then the answer rose to his lips easily, without effort.

 ��He took my blood,�� said Harry. 

��Precisely!�� said Dumbledore. ��He took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! Your

��507ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

blood in his veins, Harry, Lily��s protection inside both of you! He tethered you to life while he 
lives!�� 

��I live ... while he lives? But I thought ... I thought it was the other way around! I thought we 
both had to die? Or is it the same thing?�� 

He was distracted by the whimpering and thumping of the agonized creature behind them and 
glanced back at it yet again.

 ��Are you sure we can��t do anything?��

 ��There is no help possible.��

 ��Then explain ... more,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore smiled. 

��You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry, the Horcrux he never meant to make. He had rendered 
his soul so unstable that it broke apart when he committed those acts of unspeakable evil, the 
murder of your parents, the attempted killing of a child. But what escaped from that room was 
even less than he knew. He left more than his body behind. He left part of himself latched to you, 
the would-be victim who had survived. 

��And his knowledge remained woefully incomplete, Harry! That which Voldemort does not 
value, he takes no trouble to comprehend. Of house-elves and children��s tales, of love, loyalty, and 
innocence, Voldemort knows and understands nothing. Nothing. That they all have a power 
beyond his own, a power beyond the reach of any magic, is a truth he has never grasped. 

��He took your blood believing it would strengthen him. He took into his body a tiny part of the 
enchantment your mother laid upon you when she died for you. His body keeps her sacrafice alive, 
and while that enchantment survives, so do you and so does Voldemort��s one last hope for 
himself.��

 Dumbledore smiled at Harry, and Harry stared at him.

 ��And you knew this? You knew �C all along?�� 

��I guessed. But my guesses have usually been good,�� said Dumbledore happily, and they sat in 
silence for what seemed like a long time, while the creature behind them continued to whimper and 
tremble. 

��There��s more,�� said Harry. ��There��s more to it. Why did my wand break the wand he 
borrowed?��

 ��As to that, I cannot be sure.��

��Have a guess, then,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore laughed. 

��What you must understand, Harry, is that you and Lord Voldemort have journeyed together 
into realms of magic hitherto unknown and untested. But here is what I think happened, and it is 
unprecedented, and no wandmaker could, I think, ever have predicted or explained it to 
Voldemort. 

��Without meaning to, as you now know, Lord Voldemort doubled the bond between you when 
he returned to a human form. A part of his soul was still attached to yours, and, thinking to 
strengthen himself, he took a part of your mother��s sacrafice into himself. If he could only have 
understood the precise and terrible power of that sacrifice, he would not, perhaps, have dared to 
touch your blood... But then, if he had been able to understand, he could not be Lord Voldemort, 
and might never have murdered at all. 

��Having ensured this two-fold connection, having wrapped your destinies together more 
securely than ever two wizards were joined in history, Voldemort proceeded to attack you with a 
wand that shared a core with yours. And now something very strange happened, as we know. The 
cores reacted in a way that Lord Voldemort, who never knew that your wand was a twin of his, had 
never expected. 

��He was more afraid than you were that night, Harry. You had accepted, even embraced, the 
possibility of death, something Lord Voldemort has never been able to do. Your courage won, 
your wand overpowered his. And in doing so, something happened between those wands, 
something that echoed the relationship between their masters. 

��I believe that your wand imbibed some of the power and qualities of Voldemort��s wand that 
night, which is to say that it contained a little of Voldemort himself. So your wand recognized him 
when he pursued you, recognized a man who was both kin and mortal enemy, and it regurgitated 
some of his own magic against him, magic much more powerful than anything Lucius��s wand had 
ever performed. Your wand now contained the power of your enormous courage and of 
Voldemort��s own deadly skill, What chance did that poor stick of Lucius Malfoy��s stand?��

 ��But if my wand was so powerful, how come Hermione was able to break it?�� asked Harry. 

��My dear boy, its remarkable effects were directed only at Voldemort, who had tampered so ill-
advisedly with the deepest laws of magic. Only toward him was that wand abnormally powerful. 
Otherwise it was a wand like any other ... though a good one, I am sure,�� Dumbledore finished

kindly. 

Harry sat in thought for a long time, or perhaps seconds. It was very hard to be sure of things 
like time here.

 ��He killed me with your wand.�� 

��He failed to kill you with my wand,�� Dumbledore corrected Harry. ��I think we can agree that 
you are not dead �C though, of course,�� he added, as if fearing he had been discourteous, ��I do not 
minimize your sufferings, which I am sure were severe.�� 

��I feel great at the moment, though,�� said Harry, looking down at his clean, unblemished hands. 
��Where are we, exactly?�� 

��Well, I was going to ask you that,�� said Dumbledore, looking around. ��Where would you say 
that we are?�� 

Until Dumbledore had asked, Harry had not known. Now, however, he found that he had an 
answer ready to give. 

��It looks,�� he said slowly, ��like King��s Cross station. Except a lot cleaner and empty, and there 
are no trains as far as I can see.��

 ��King��s Cross station!�� Dumbledore was chuckling immoderately. ��Good gracious, really?��

 ��Well, where do you think we are?�� asked Harry, a little defensively.

 ��My dear boy, I have no idea. This is, as they say, your party.�� 

Harry had no idea what this meant; Dumbledore was being infuriating. He glared at him, then 
remembered a much more pressing question than that of their current location. 

��The Deathly Hallows,�� he said, and he was glad to see that the words wiped the smile from 
Dumbledore��s face. 

 ��Ah, yes,�� he said. He even looked a little worried. 

 ��Well?�� 

For the first time since Harry had met Dumbledore, he looked less than an old man, much less. 

He looked fleetingly like a small boy caught in wrongdoing. 

��Can you forgive me?�� he said. ��Can you forgive me for not trusting you? For not telling you? 
Harry, I only feared that you would fail as I had failed. I only dreaded that you would make my 
mistakes. I crave your pardon, Harry. I have known, for some time now, that you are the better 
man.��

��510ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��What are you talking about?�� asked Harry, startled by Dumbledore��s tone, by the sudden tears 

in his eyes.

 ��The Hallows, the Hallows,�� murmured Dumbledore. ��A desperate man��s dream!��

 ��But they��re real!�� 

��Real, and dangerous, and a lure for fools,�� said Dumbledore. ��And I was such a fool. But you 

know, don��t you? I have no secrets from you anymore. You know.��

 ��What do I know?�� 

Dumbledore turned his whole body to face Harry, and tears still sparkled in the brilliantly blue 

eyes.

 ��Master of death, Harry, master of Death! Was I better, ultimately, than Voldemort?�� 

��Of course you were,�� said Harry. ��Of course �C how can you ask that? You never killed if you 
could avoid it!�� 

��True, true,�� said Dumbledore, and he was like a child seeking reassurance. ��Yet I too sought a 
way to conquer death, Harry.�� 

��Not the way he did,�� said Harry. After all his anger at Dumbledore, how odd it was to sit here, 
beneath the high, vaulted ceiling, and defend Dumbledore from himself. ��Hallows, not 
Horcruxes.��

 ��Hallows,�� murmured Dumbledore, ��not Horcruxes. Precisely.��

 There was a pause. The creature behind them whimpered, but Harry no longer looked around. 

 ��Grindelwald was looking for them too?�� he asked.

 Dumbledore closed his eyes for a moment and nodded. 

��It was the thing, above all, that drew us together,�� he said quietly. ��Two clever, arrogant boys 
with a shared obsession. He wanted to come to Godric��s Hollow, as I am sure you have guessed, 
because of the grave of Ignotus Peverell. He wanted to explore the place the third brother had 
died.��

 ��So it��s true?�� asked Harry. ��All of it? The Peverell brothers �C�� 

��-were the three brothers of the tale?�� said Dumbledore, nodding. ��Oh yes, I think so. Whether 
they met Death on a lonely road ... I think it more likely that the Peverell brothers were simply 
gifted, dangerous wizards who succeeded in creating those powerful objects. The story of them 
being Death��s own Hallows seems to me the sort of legend that might have sprung up around such

��511ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

creations. 

��The Cloak, as you know now, traveled down through the ages, father to son, mother to 
daughter, right down to Ignotus��s last living descendant, who was born, as Ignotus was, in the 
village of Godric��s Hollow.��

 Dumbledore smiled at Harry.

 ��Me?�� 

��You. You have guessed, I know, why the Cloak was in my possession on the night your 
parents died. James had showed it to me just a few days previously. It explained much of his 
undetected wrongdoing at school! I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I asked to borrow it, to 
examine it. I had long since given up my dream of uniting the Hallows, but I could not resist, could 
not help taking a closer look... It was a Cloak the likes of which I had never seen, immensely old, 
perfect in every respect ... and then your father died, and I had two Hallows at last, all to myself!��

 His tone was unbearably bitter. 

��The Cloak wouldn��t have helped them survive, though,�� Harry said quickly. ��Voldemort knew 
where my mum and dad were. The Cloak couldn��t have made them curse-proof.��

 ��True,�� sighed Dumbledore. ��True.��

 Harry waited, but Dumbledore did not speak, so he prompted him.

 ��So you��d given up looking for the Hallows when you saw the Cloak?��

 ��Oh yes,�� said Dumbledore faintly. It seemed that he forced himself to meet Harry��s eyes. ��You 

know what happened. You know. You cannot despise me more than I despise myself.��

 ��But I don��t despise you �C�� 

��Then you should,�� said Dumbledore. He drew a deep breath. ��You know the secret of my 
sister��s ill health, what those Muggles did, what she became. You know how my poor father 
sought revenge, and paid the price, died in Azkaban. You know how my mother gave up her own 
life to care for Ariana.

 ��I resented it, Harry.�� 

Dumbledore stated it baldly, coldly. He was looking now over the top of Harry��s head, into the 
distance.

 ��I was gifted, I was brilliant. I wanted to escape. I wanted to shine. I wanted glory. 

��Do not misunderstand me,�� he said, and pain crossed the face so that he looked ancient again.

��512ҳ�� 
542ҳ

��I loved them, I loved my parents, I loved my brother and my sister, but I was selfish, Harry, more 
selfish than you, who are a remarkably selfless person, could possibly imagine. 

��So that, when my mother died, and I was left the responsibility of a damaged sister and a 
wayward brother, I returned to my village in anger and bitterness. Trapped and wasted, I thought! 
And then of course, he came...��

 Dumbledore looked directly into Harry��s eyes again. 

��Grindelwald. You cannot imagine how his ideas caught me, Harry, inflamed me. Muggles 
forced into subservience. We wizards triumphant. Grindelwald and I, the glorious young leaders of 
the revolution.

 ��Oh, I had a few scruples�˼�. I assuaged my conscience with empty words. It would all be for 
the greater good, and any harm done would be repaid a hundredfold in benefits for wizards. Did I 
know, in my heart of hearts, what Gellert Grindelwald was? I think I did, but I closed my eyes. If 
the plans we were making came to fruition, all my dreams would come true. 

��And at the heart of our schemes, the Deathly Hallows! How they fascinated him, how they 
fascinated both of us! The unbeatable wand, the weapon that would lead us to power! The 
Resurrection Stone �C to him, though I pretended not to know it, it meant an army of Inferi! To me, 
I confess, it meant the return of my parents, and the lifting of all responsibility from my shoulders. 

��And the Cloak ... somehow, we never discussed the Cloak much, Harry. Both of us could 
conceal ourselves well enough without the Cloak, the true magic of which, of course, is that it can 
be used to protect and shield others as well as its owner. I thought that, if we ever found it, it might 
be useful in hiding Ariana, but our interest in the Cloak was mainly that it completed the trio, for 
the legend said that the man who had united all three objects would then be truly master of death, 
which we took to mean ��invincible.�� 

��Invincible masters of death, Grindelwald and Dumbledore! Two months of insanity, of cruel 
dreams, and neglect of the only two members of my family left to me. 

��And then ... you know what happened. Reality returned in the form of my rough, unlettered, 
and infinitely more admirable brother. I did not want to hear the truths he shouted at me. I did not 
want to hear that I could not set forth and seek Hallows with a fragile and unstable sister in tow 
(under one��s care, ����). 

��The argument became a fight. Grindelwald lost control. That which I had always sensed in

��513ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

him, though I pretended not to, now sprang into terrible being. And Ariana ... after all my mother��s 
care and caution ... lay dead upon the floor.�� 

Dumbledore gave a little gasp and began to cry in earnest. Harry reached out and was glad to 
find that he could touch him, He gripped his arm tightly and Dumbledore gradually regained 
control. 

��Well, Grindelwald fled, as anyone but I could have predicted. He vanished, with his plans for 
seizing power, and his schemes for Muggle torture, and his dreams of the Deathly Hallows, dreams 
in which I had encouraged him and helped him. He ran, while I was left to bury my sister, and 
learn to live with my guilt and my terrible grief, the price of my shame. 

��Years passed. There were rumors about him. They said he had procured a wand of immense 
power. I, meanwhile, was offered the post of Minister of Magic, not once, but several times. 
Naturally, I refused. I had learned that I was not to be trusted with power.��

 ��But you��d have been better, much better, than Fudge or Scimgeour!�� burst out Harry. 

��Would I?�� asked Dumbledore heavily. ��I am not so sure. I had proven, as a very young man, 
that power was my weakness and my temptation. It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those 
who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have 
leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle����, ����because they must, and find to their 
own surprise that they wear it well.

 ��I was safer at Hogwarts. I think I was a good teacher �C��

 ��You were the best -�� 

��-you are very kind, Harry. But while I busied myself with the training of young wizards, 
Grindelwald was raising an army. They say he feared me, and perhaps he did, but less, I think, than 
I feared him. 

��Oh, not death,�� said Dumbledore, in answer to Harry��s questioning look. ��Not what he could 
do to me magically. I knew that we were evenly matched, perhaps that I was a shade more skillful. 
It was the truth I feared. You see, I never knew which of us, in that last, horrific fight, had actually 
cast the curse that killed my sister. You may call me cowardly, you would be right, Harry. I 
dreaded beyond all things the knowledge that it had been I who brought about her death, not 
merely through my arrogance and stupidity, but that I actually struck the blow that snuffed out her 
life.

��514ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��I think he knew it, I think he knew what frightened me. I delayed meeting him until finally, it 
would have been too shameful to resist any longer. People were dying and he seemed unstoppable, 
and I had to do what I could.

 ��Well, you know what happened next. I won the duel. I won the wand.�� 

Another silence. Harry did not ask whether Dumbledore had ever found out who struck Ariana 
dead. He did not want to know, and even less did he want Dumbledore to have to tell him. At last 
he knew what Dumbledore would have seen when he looked in the mirror of Erised, and why 
Dumbledore had been so understanding of the fascination it had exercised over Harry. 

They sat in silence for a long time, and the whipmerings of the creature behind them barely 
disturbed Harry anymore. 

At last he said, ��Grindelwald tried to stop Voldemort going after the wand. He lied, you know, 
pretended he had never had it.��

 Dumbledore nodded, looking down at his lap, tears still glittering on the crooked nose. 

��They say he showed remorse in later years, alone in his cell at Nurmengard. I hope that is true. 
I would like to think that he did feel the horror and shame of what he had done. Perhaps that lie to 
Voldemort was his attempt to make amends ... to prevent Voldemort from taking the Hallow ...�� 

��... or maybe from breaking into your tomb?�� suggested Harry, and Dumbledore dabbed his 
eyes.

 After another short pause Harry said, ��You tried to use the Resurrection Stone.��

 Dumbledore nodded. 

��When I discovered it, after all those years, buried in the abandoned home of the Gaunts -the 
Hallow I had craved most of all, though in my youth I had wanted it for very different reasons -I 
lost my head, Harry. I quite forgot that it was now a Horcrux, that the ring was sure to carry a 
curse. I picked it up, and I put it on, and for a second I imagined that I was about to see Ariana, and 
my mother, and my father, and to tell them how very, very sorry, I was... 

��I was such a fool, Harry. After all those years I had learned nothing. I was unworthy to unite 

the Deathly Hallows, I had proved it time and again, and here was final proof.��

 ��Why?�� said Harry. ��It was natural! You wanted to see them again. What��s wrong with that?��

 ��Maybe a man in a million could unite the Hallows, Harry. I was fit only to possess the meanest 

of them, the least extraordinary. I was fit to own the Elder Wand, and not boast of it, and not to kill

��515ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

with it. I was permitted to tame and use it, because I took it, not for gain, but to save others from it. 

��But the Cloak, I took out of vain curiousity, and so it could never have worked for me as it 
works for you, its true owners. The stone I would have used in an attempt to drag back those who 
are at peace, rather than enable my self-sacrafice, as you did. You are the worthy possessor of the 
Hallows.�� 

Dumbledore patted Harry��s hand, and Harry looked up at the old man and smiled; he could not 

help himself. How could he remain angry with Dumbledore now?

 ��Why did you have to make it so difficult?��

 Dumbledore��s smile was tremulous. 

��I am afraid I counted on Miss Granger to slow you up, Harry. I was afraid that your hot head 
might dominate your good heart. I was scared that, if presented outright with the facts about those 
tempting objects, you might seize the Hallows as I did, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons. If 
you laid hands on them, I wanted you to possess them safely. You are the true master of death, 
because the true master does not seek to run away from Death. He accepts that he must die, and 
understands that there are far, far worse things in the living world than dying.��

 ��And Voldemort never knew about the Hallows?�� 

��I do not think so, because he did not recognize the Resurrection Stone he turned into a 
Horcrux. But even if he had known about them, Harry. I doubt that he would have been interested 
in any except the first. He would not think that he needed the Cloak, and as for the stone, whom 
would he want to bring back from the dead? He fears the dead. He does not love.��

 ��But you expected him to go after the wand?�� 

��I have been sure that he would try, ever since your wand beat Voldemort��s in the graveyard of 
Little Hangleton. At first, he was afraid that you had conquered him by superior skill. Once he had 
kidnapped Ollivander, however, he discovered the existence of the twin cores. He thought that 
explained everything. Yet the borrowed wand did no better against yours! So Voldemort, instead 
of asking himself what quality it was in you that had made your wand so strong, what gift you 
possessed that he did not, naturally set out to find the one wand that, they said, would beat any 
other. For him, the Elder Wand has become an obsession to rival his obsession with you. He 
believes that the Elder Wand removes his last weakness and makes him truly invincible. Poor 
Severus ...��

��516ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��If you planned your death with Snape, you meant him to end up with the Elder Wand, didn��t 

you?��

 ��I admit that was my intention,�� said Dumbledore, ��but it did not work as I intended, did it?��

 ��No,�� said Harry. ��That bit didn��t work out.�� 

The creature behind them jerked and moaned, and Harry and Dumbledore sat without talking 

for the longest time yet. The realization of what would happen next settled gradually over Harry in 

the long minutes, like softly falling snow. 

 ��I��ve got to go back, haven��t I?��

 ��That is up to you.��

 ��I��ve got a choice?�� 

��Oh yes,�� Dumbledore smiled at him. ��We are in King��s Cross you say? I think that if you 

decided not to go back, you would be able to ... let��s say ... board a train.��

 ��And where would it take me?��

 ��On,�� said Dumbledore simply.

 Silence again.

 ��Voldemort��s got the Elder Wand.��

 ��True. Voldemort has the Elder Wand.��

 ��But you want me to go back?�� 

��I think,�� said Dumbledore, ��that if you choose to return, there is a chance that he may be 
finished for good. I cannot promise it. But I know this, Harry, that you have less to fear from 
returning here than he does.�� 

Harry glanced again at the raw looking thing that trembled and choked in the shadow beneath 
the distant chair. 

��Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, those who live without love. By 
returning, you may ensure that fewer souls are maimed, fewer families are torn apart. If that seems 
to you a worthy goal, then we say good-bye for the present.�� 

Harry nodded and sighed. Leaving this place would not be nearly as hard as walking into the 
forest had been, but it was warm and light and peaceful here, and he knew that he was heading 
back to pain and the fear of more loss. He stood up, and Dumbledore did the same, and they 
looked for a long moment into each other��s faces.

��517ҳ��

��Tell me one last thing,�� said Harry, ��Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head?�� 

Dumbledore beamed at him, and his voice sounded loud and strong in Harry��s ears even though 
the bright mist was descending again, obscuring his figure. 

��Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean it is not 
real?��

Chapter Thirty-Six 
The Flaw in the Plan 



He was lying facedown on the ground again. 


The smell of the 
forest filled his nostrils. He could feel the cold 

hard ground 
beneath his cheek, and the hinge of his glasses 

which have been 
knocked sideways by the fall cutting into his 

temple. Every 
inch of him ached, and the place where Killing 

Curse had hit him 
felt like the bruise of an iron-clad punch. He did 

not stir, but he 
remained exactly where he had fallen, with his left arm bent out at an akward angle and his mouth 
gaping. 

He had expected to hear cheer of triumph and jubilation at his death, but instead hurried 

footsteps, whispers, and solicitous (anxious, concerned) murmurs filled the air.

 "My Lord... my Lord...�� 

It was Bellatrix's voice, and she spoke as if to a lover. Harry did not dare open his eyes, but 
allowed his other senses to explore his predicament. He knew that his wand was still stowed 
beneath his robes because he could feel it pressed between his chest and the ground. A slight 
cushioning effect in the area of his stomach told him that the Invisibility Cloak was also there, 
stuffed out of sight. 

"My Lord...��

 "That will do���ˣ�����," said Voldemort's voice. 

More footsteps. Several people were backing away from the same spot. Desperate to see what 
was happening and why, Harry opened his eyes by a milimeter. 

Voldemort seemed to be getting to his feet. Various Death Eaters were hurrying away from 
him, returning to the crowd lining the clearing. Bellatrix alone remained behind, kneeling beside 
Voldemort. 

Harry closed his eyes again and considered what he had seen. The Death Eaters had been 
huddled around Voldemort, who seem to have fallen to the ground. Something had happened when 
he had hit Harry with the Killing Curse. Had Voldemort too collapsed? It seemed like it. And both 
of them had briefly fallen unconcious and both of them had now returned...

��519ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"My Lord, let me -" 

"I do not require assitance," said Voldemort coldly, and though he could not see it, Harry 
pictured Bellatrix withdrawing a helpful hand. "The boy ... Is he dead?" 

There was a complete silence in the clearing. Nobody approached Harry, but he felt their 
concentraded gaze; it seemed to press him harder into the ground, and he was terrified a finger or 
an eyelid might twitch. 

"You," said Voldemort, and there was a bang and a small shrick of pain. "Examine him. Tell 
me whether he is dead." 

Harry did not know who had been sent to verify. He could only lie there, with his heart 
thumping traitorously, and wait to be examined, but at the same time noting, small comfort though 
it was, that Voldemort was wary of approaching him, that Voldemort suspected that all had not 
gone to plan ... 

Hands, softer than he had been expecting, touched Harry's face, and felt his heart. He could 

hear the woman's fast breathing, her pounding of life against his ribs. 

"Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?" 

The whisper was barely audible, her lips were an inch from his scar, her head bent so low that 

her long hair shielded his face from the onlookers. 

"Yes," he breathed back. 

He felt the hand on his chest contract, her nails pierced him. Then it was withdrawn. She had 

sat up. 

 "He is dead!" Narcissa Malfoy called to the watchers. 

And now they shouted, now they yelled in triumph and stamped their feet, and through his 

eyelids, Harry saw bursts of red and silver light shoot into the air in celebration. 

Still feigning death on the ground, he understood. Narcissa knew that the only way she would 
be permitted to enter Hogwarts, and find her son, was as part of the conquering army. She no 
longer cared whether Voldemort won. 

"You see?" screeched Voldemort over the tumult. "Harry Potter is dead by my hand, and no 
man alive can threaten me now! Watch! Crucio!" 

Harry had been expecting it, knew his body would not be allowed to remain unsullied (sully tarnish; 
stain, disgrace) upon the forest floor; it must be subjected to humiliation to prove

��520ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Voldemort's victory. He was lifted into the air, and it took all his determination to remain limp, yet 
the pain he expected did not come. He was thrown once, twice, three times into the air. His glasses 
flew off and he felt his wand slide a little beneath his robes, but he kept himself floppy and lifeless, 
and when he fell to the ground for the last time, the clearing echoed with jeers and shrieks of 
laughter. 

"Now," said Voldemort, "we go to the castle, and show them what has become of their hero. 
Who shall drag the body? No - Wait -" 

There was a fresh outbreak of laughter, and after a few moments Harry felt the ground 
trembling beneath him. 

"You carry him," Voldemort said. "He will be nice and visible in your arms, will he not? Pick 
up your little friend, Hagrid. And the glasses - put on the glasses - he must be recognizable -" 

Someone slammed Harry's glasses back onto his face with deliberate force, but the enormous 
hands that lifted him into the air were exceedingly gentle. Harry could feel Hagrid's arms 
trembling with the force of his heaving sobs; great tears splashed down upon him as Hagrid 
cradled Harry in his arms, and Harry did not dare, by movement or word, to intimate��ʾ 
,���� 
to 
Hagrid that all was not, yet, lost. 

"Move," said Voldemort, and Hagrid stumbled forward, forcing his way through the close-
growing trees, back through the forest. 

Branches caught at Harry's hair and robes, but he lay quiescent (motionless, inactive), his mouth 
lolling open, his eyes shut, and in the darkness, while the Death Eaters crowed all around them, 
and while Hagrid sobbed blindly, nobody looked to see whether a pulse beat in the exposed neck 
of Harry Potter... 

The two giants crashed along behind the Death Eaters; Harry could hear trees creaking and 
falling as they passed; they made so much din that birds rose shrieking into the sky, and even the 
jeers of the Death Eaters were drowned. The victorious procession marched on toward the open 
ground, and after a while Harry could tell, by the lightening of the darkness through his closed 
eyelids, that the trees were beginning to thin. 

 "BANE!" 

Hagrid's unexpected bellow nearly forced Harry's eyes open. "Happy now, are yeh, that yeh 
didn't fight, yeh cowardly bunch o' nags? Are yeh happy Harry Potter's - d-dead ...?" 

��521ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

Hagrid could not continue, but broke down in fresh tears. Harry wondered how many centaurs 
were watching their procession pass; he dared not open his eyes to look. Some of the Death Eaters 
called insults at the centaurs as they left them behind. A little later, Harry sensed, by a freshening 
of the air, that they had reached the edge of the forest. 

 "Stop." 

Harry thought that Hagrid must have been forced to obey Voldemort's command, because he 
lurched a little. And now a chill settled over them where they sood, and Harry heard the rasping 
breath of the dementors that patrolled the other trees. They would not affect him now. 

The fact of his own survival burned inside him, a talisman against them, as though his father's 
stag kept guardian in his heart. 

Someone passed close by Harry, and he knew that it was Voldemort himself because he spoke a 
moment later, his voice magically magnified so that it swelled through the ground, crashing upon 
Harry's eardrums. 

"Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down 
your lives for him. We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone. 

"The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you, and 
the Boy Who Lived is finished. There must be no more war. Anyone who continues to resist, man, 
woman or child, will be slaughtered, as will every member of their family. Come out of the castle 
now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and 
sisters will live and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build togheter." 

There was silence in the grounds and from the castle. Voldemort was so close to him that Harry 
did not dare open his eyes again. 

"Come," said Voldemort, and Harry heard him move ahead, and Hagrid was forced to follow. 
Now Harry opened his eyes a fraction, and saw Voldemort striding in front them, wearing the great 
snake Nagini around his shoulders, now free of her enchanted cage. But Harry had no possibility 
of extracting the wand concealed under his robes without being noticed by the Death Eaters, who 
marched on the either side of them through the slowly lightening darkness ... 

 "Harry," sobbed Hagrid. "Oh, Harry ... Harry ...�� 

Harry shut his eyes tight again. He knew that they were approaching the castle and strained his 
ears to distinguish, above the gleeful voices of the Death Eaters and their tramping footsteps, signs

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

of life from those within. 

 "Stop." 

The Death Eaters came to a halt; Harry heard them spreading out in a line facing the opne front 
doors of the school. He could see, even through his closed lids, the reddish glow that meant light 
streamed upon him from the entrance hall. He waited. Any moment, the people for whom he had 
tried to die would see him, lying apparently dead, in Hagrid's arms.

 "NO!" 

The scream was the more terrible because he had never expected or dreamed that Professor 
McGonagall could make such a sound. He heard another women laughing nearby, and knew that 
Bellatrix gloried��ϲ in McGonagall's despair. He squinted again for a single second and saw the 
open doorway filling with people, as the survivors of the battle came out onto the front steps to 
face their vanquishers and see the truth of Harry's death for themselves. He saw Voldemort 
standing a little in front of him, stroking Nagini's head with a single white finger. He closed his 
eyes again.

 "No!" 

"No!"

 "Harry! HARRY!" 

Ron's, Hermione's, and Ginny's voices were worse than McGonagall's; Harry wanted nothing 
more than to call back, yet he made himself lie silent, and their cries acted like a trigger; the crowd 
of survivors took up the cause, screaming and yelling abuse at the Death Eathers, until - 

"SILENCE!" cried Voldemort, and there was a bang and a flash of bright light, and silence was 

forced upn them all. "It is over! Set him down, Hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!"

 Harry felt himself lowered onto the grass. 

"You see?" said Voldemort, and Harry felt him striding backward and forward right beside the 
place where he lay. "Harry Potter is dead! Do you understand now, deluded ones? He was nothing, 
ever, but a boy who relied on others to sacrifice themselves for him!" 

"He beat you!" yelled Ron, and the charm broke, and the defenders of Hogwarts were shouting 
and screaming again until a second, more powerful bang extinguished their voices once more.

 "He was killed while trying to sneak out of the castle grounds," said Voldemort, and there was a 
relish in his voice for the lie. "killed while trying to save himself - " 

��523ҳ��

But Voldemort broke off, Harry heard a scuffle (quarrel, minor fight) and a shout, then another 
bang, a flash of light, and grunt of pain; he opened his eyes an infinitesimal amount. Someone had 
broken free of the crowd and charged at Voldemort. Harry saw the figure hit the ground. 
Disarmed. Voldemort throwing the challenger's wand aside and laughing. 

"And who is this?" he said in his soft snake's hiss. "Who has volunteered to demonstrate what 

happens to those who continue to fight when the battle is lost?" 

 Bellatrix gave a delighted laugh. 

"It is Neville Longbottom, my Lord! The boy who has been giving the Carrows so much 

trouble! The son of the Aurors, remember?" 

"Ah, yes, I remember," said Voldemort, looking down at Neville, who was struggling back to 
his feet, unarmed and unproctected, standing in the no-man's-land��յش� 
between the survivors 
and the Death Eaters. "But you are a pureblood, aren't you, my brave boy?" Voldemort asked 
Neville, who stood facing him, his empty hands curled in fists. 

 "So what if I am?" said Neville loudly. 

"You show spirit and bravery, and you come of noble stock. You will make a very valuable 
Death Eater. We need your kind, Neville Longbottom." 

"I'll join you when hell freezes over," said Neville. "Dumbledore's Army!" he shouted, and 
there was an answering cheer from the crowd, whom Voldemort's Silencing Charms seemed 
unable to hold. 

"Very well," said Voldemort, and Harry heard more danger in the silkiness of his voice than in 
the most powerful curse. "If that is your choice, Longbottom, we revert to the original plan. On 
your head," he said quietly, "be it." 

Still watching through his lashes, Harry saw Voldemort wave his wand. Seconds later, out of 
one of the castle's shattered windows, something that looked like a misshapen bird flew through 
the half light and landed in Voldemort's hand. He shook the mildewed object by its pointed end 
and it dangled, emtpy and ragged, the Sorting Hat. 

"There will be no more Sorting at Hogwarts School," said Voldemort. "There will be no more 
Houses. The emblem, shield and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slythering, will suffice 
everyone. Won't they, Neville Longbottom?" 

He pointed his wand at Neville, who grew rigid and still, then forced the hat onto Neville's

��524ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

head, so that it slipped down below his eyes. There were movements from the watching crowd in 
front of the castle, and as one, the Death Eaters raised their wands, holding the fighters of 
Hogwarts at bay. 

"Neville here is now going to demonstrate what happens to anyone foolish enough to continue 
to oppose me," said Voldemort, and with a flick of his wand, he caused the Sorting Hat to burst 
into flames. 

Screams split the dawn, and Neville was aflame, rooted to the spot, unable to move, and Harry 

could not bear it, He must act - 

 And then many things happened at the same moment. 

They heard uproar from the distant boundary of the school as what sounded like hundreds of 
people came swarming over the out-of-sight walls and pelted toward the castle, uttering loud war 
cries. At the same time, Grawp came lumbering around the side of the castel and yelled, 
"HAGGER!" His cry was answered by roars from Voldemort's giants. They ran at Grawp like bull 
elephants making the earth quake. Then came hooves and the twangs of bows, and arrows were 
suddenly falling amongst the Death Eaters, who broke ranks, shouting their surprise. Harry pulled 
the Invisibilty Cloak from inside his robes, swunt it over himself, and sprang to his feet, as Neville 
moved too. 

In one swift, fluid motin, Neville broke free of the Body-Bind Curse upon him; the flaming hat 
fell off him and he drew from its depths something silver, with a glittering, rubied handle - 

The slash of the silver blade could not be heard over the roar of the oncoming crowd or the 
sounds of the clashing giants or of the stampending centaurs, and yet, it seemd to draw every eye. 
With a single stroke Neville sliced off the great snake's head, which spun high into the air, 
gleaming in the light flooding from the entrance hall, and Voldemort's mouth was open in a scream 
of fury that nobody could hear, and the snake's body thudded to the ground at his feet. 

Hidden beneath the Invisibilty Cloak, Harry cast a Shield Charm between Neville and 
Voldemort before the latter could raise his wand. Then, over the screams and roars and the 
thunderous stamps of the battling giants, Hagrid's yell came loudets of all.

 "HARRY!" Hagrid shouted. "HARRY - WHERE'S HARRY?" 

Chaos reigned. The charging centaurs were scattering the Death Eaters, everyone was fleeing 
the giants' stamping feet, and nearer and nearar thundered the reinforcements that had come from

��525ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

who knew where; Harry saw great winged creatues soaring around the heads of Voldemort's 
giants, thestrals and Buckbeak the hippogriff scratching at their eyes while Grawp punched and 
pummeled them and now the wizards, defenders of Hogwarts and Death Eaters alike were being 
forced back into the castle. Harry was shooting jinxes and curses at any Death Eater he could see, 
and they crumpled, not knowing what or who had hit them, and their bodies were trampled by the 
retreating crowd. 

Still hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, Harry was buffetted into the entrance hall. He was 
searching for Voldemort and saw him across the room, firing spells from his wand as he backed 
into the Great Hall, still screaming instructions to his followers as he sent curses flying left and 
right; Harry cast more Shield Charms, and Voldemort's would-be victims, Seamus Finnigan and 
Hannah Abbott, darted past him into the Great Hall, where they joined the fight already flourishing 
inside it. 

And now there were more, even more people storming up the front steps, and Harry saw 
Charlie Weasly overtaking Horace Slughorn, who was still wearing his emeral pyjamas. They 
seemed to have returned at the head of what looked like the families and friends of every Hogwarts 
student who had remained to fight along with the shopkeepers and homeowners of Hogsmeade. 
The centaurs Bane, Ronan and Magorian burst into the hall with a great clatter of hooves, as 
behind Harry the door that led to the kitchens was blasted off its hinges. 

The house-elves of Hogwarts swarmed into the entrance hall, screaming and waving carving 
knives�����õĲ͵� 
and cleaver (heavy butcher knife), and at their head, the locker of Regulus 
Black bouncing on his chest, was Kreacher, his bullfrog's voice audible even above this din, 
"Fight! Fight! Fight for my Master, defender of house-elves! Fight the Dark Lord, in the name of 
brave Regulus! Fight!" 

They were hacking and stabbing at the ankles and shins of Death Eaters, their tiny faces alive 
with malice, and everywhere Harry looked Death Eaters were folding under sheer weight of 
numbers, overcome by spells, dragging arrows from wounds, stabbed in the leg by elves, or else 
simply attempting to escape, but swallowed by the oncoming horde. 

 But it was not over yet, Harry sped between duelers, past struggling prisoners, and into he Great 
Hall.

��526ҳ��

Voldemort was in the center of the battle, and he was striking and smiting (smite -hit, strike) 
all within reach. Harry could not get a clear shot, but fought his way nearer, still invisible, and the 
Great Hall became more and more crowded as everyone who could walk forced their way inside. 

Harry saw Yaxley slammed to the floor by George and Lee Jordan, saw Dolohov fall with a 
scream at Flitwick's hands, saw Walden Macnair thrown across the room by Hagrid, hit the stone 
wall opposite, and slide unconscious to the ground. He saw Ron and Neville bringing down Fenrir 
Greyback. Aberforth Stunning Rookwood, Arthur and Percy flooring Thicknesse, and Lucius and 
Narcissa Malfoy running through the crowd, not even attempting to fight, screaming for their son. 

Voldemort was now dueling McGonagall, Slughorn, Kingsley all at once, and there was a cold 
hatred in his face as they wove and ducked around him, unable to finish him. 

Bellatrix was still fighing too, fifty yards away from Voldemort, and like her master she dueled 
three at once, Hermione, Ginny and Luna, all battling their hardest, but Bellatrix was equal to 
them, and Harry's attention was diverted as a Killing Curse shot so close to Ginny that she missed 
death by an inch. 

He changed course, running at Bellatrix rather than Voldemort, but before he had gone a few 

steps he was knocked sideways.

 "NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!" 

Mrs. Weasley threw off her cloak as she ran, freeing her arms, Bellatrix spun on the spot, 

roaring with laughter at the sight of the new challenger. 

"OUT OF MY WAY!" shouted Mrs. Weasley to the three girls, and with a simple swipe of her 
wand she began to duel. Harry watched with terror and elation as Molly Weasley's wand slashed 
and twisted, and Bellatrix Lestrange's smile faltered and became a snarl. Jets of light flew from 
both wands, the floor around the withces' feet became hot and cracked; both woman were fighting 
to kill. 

"No!" Mrs. Weasley cried as a few students ran forward, trying to come to her aid. "Get back! 
Get back! She is mine!" 

Hundreds of people now lined the walls, watching the two fights, Voldemort and his three 
opponents, Bellatrix and Molly, and Harry stood, invisible, torn between both, wanting to attack 
and yet to protect, unable to be sure that he would not hit the innocent. 

"What will happen to your children when I've killed you?" taunted Bellatrix, as mad as her

��527ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

master, capering (jump about) as Molly's curses danced around her. "When Mummy's gone the 
same way as Freddie?" 
"You - will - never - touch - our - children - again!" screamed Mrs. Weasley. 
Bellatrix laughed the same exhilarated laugh her cousin Sirius had given as he toppled 
backward through the veil, and suddenly Harry knew what was going to happen before it did. 
Molly's curse soared beneath Bellatrix's outstretched arm and hit her squarely in the chest, 
directly over her heart. 

Bellatrix's gloating smile froze, her eyes seemd to bulge. For the tiniest space of time she knew 
what had happened, and then she toppled, and the watching crowd roared, and Voldemord 
screamed. 

Harry felt as though he turned into slow motin, he saw McGonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn 
blasted backward, flailing and writhing through the air, as Voldemort's fury at the fall of his last, 
best leutenant exploded with the force of a bomb, Voldemort raised his wand and directed it at 
Molly Weasley. 

"Protego!" roared Harry, and the Shield Charm expanded in the middle of the Hall, and 
Voldemort stared around for the source as Harry pulled off the Invisibility Cloak at last. 
The yell of shock, the cheers, the screams on every side of "Harry!" "HE'S ALIVE!" were 
stifled at once. 
The crowd was afraid, and silence fell abruptly and completely as Voldemort and Harry looked 
at each other, and began, at the same moment, to circle each other. 
"I don't want anyone else to try to help," Harry said loudly, and in the total silence his voice 

carried like a trumpet call. "It's got to be like this. It's got to be me."

 Voldemort hissed. 

"Potter doesn't mean that," he said, his red eyes wide. "This isn't how he works, is it? Who are 
you going to use as a shield today, Potter?" 

"Nobody," said Harry simply. "There are no more Horcruxes. It's just you and me. Neither can 
live while the other survives, and one of us is about to leave for good." 

"One of us?" jeered Voldemort, and his wholy body was taut and his red eyes stared, a snake 
that was about to strike. "You think it will be you, do you, the boy who has survived by accident, 
and because Dumbledore was pulling the strings��Ļ�����?"

��528ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"Accident, was it, when my mother died to save me?" asked Harry. They were still moving 
sideways, both of them, in that perfect circle, maintaining the same distance from each other, and 
for Harry no face existed but Voldemort's. "Accident, when I decided to fight in that graveyard? 
Accident, that I didn't defend myself tonight, and still survived, and returned to fight again?" 

"Accidents!" screamed Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and the watching crowd was 
frozen as if Petrified, and of the hundreds in the Hall, nobody seemed to breathe but they two. 
"Accident and chance and the fact that you crouched and sniveled behind the skirts of greater men 
and women, and permitted me to kill them for you!" 

"You won't be killing anyone else tonight," said Harry as they circled, and stared into each 
other's eyes, green into red. "You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I 
was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people -" 

 "But you did not!" 

"-I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. 
Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. 
You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?"

 "You dare -" 

"Yes, I dare," said Harry. "I know things you don't know, Tom Riddle. I know lots of important 
things that you don't. Want to hear some, before you make another big mistake?" 

Voldemort did not speak, but prowled in a circle, and Harry knew that he kept him temporarily 
mesmerized at bay, held back by the faintest possibility that Harry might indeed know a final 
secret.

 "Is it love again?" said Voldemort, his snake's face jeering. "Dumbledore favorite solution, love, 
which he claimed conqered death, though love did not stop him falling from the tower and 
breaking like and old waxwork? Love, which did not prevent me stamping out your Modblood 
mother like a cockroack, Potter -and nobody seems to love you enough to run forward this time 
and take my curse. So what will stop you dying now when I strike?" 

"Just one thing," said Harry, and still they circled each other, wrapped in each other, held apart 
by nothing but the last secret. 

"If it is not love that will save you this time," said Voldemort, "you must believe that you have 
magic that I do not, or else a weapon more powerful than mine?"

��529ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"I believe both," said Harry, and he saw shock flit across the snake-like face, though it was 
instantly dispelled; Voldemort began to laugh, and the sound was more frightening than his 
screams; humorles and insane, it echoed around the silent Hall. 

"You think you know more magic than I do?" he said. "Than I, than Lord Voldemort, who has 
performed magic that Dumbledore himself never dreamed of?" 

"Oh he dreamed of it," said Harry, "but he knew more than you, knew enough not to do what 
you've done." 

"You mean he was weak!" screamed Voldemort. "Too weak to dare, too weak to take what 
might have been his, what will be mine!"

 "No, he was cleverer than you," said Harry, "a better wizard, a better man."

 "I brought about the death of Albus Dumbledore!"

 "You thought you did," said Harry, "but you were wrong." 

For the frist time, the watching crowd stirred as the hundreds of people around the walls drew 

breath as one. 

"Dumbledore is dead!" Voldemort hurled the words at Harry as though they would cause him 
undurable pain. "His body decays in the marble tomb in the grounds of this castle, I have seen it, 
Potter, and he will not return!" 

"Yes, Dumbledore is dead," said Harry calmly, "but you didn't have him killed. He chose his 
own manner of dying, chose it months before he died, arranged the whole thing with the man you 
thought was your servant." 

"What childish dream is this?" said Voldemort, but still he did not strike, and his red eyes did 
not waver from Harry's. 

"Severus Snape wasn't yours," said Harry. "Snape was Dumbledore's. Dumbledore's from the 
moment you starting hunting down my mother. And you never realized it, because of the thing you 
can't understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?" 

Voldemort did not answer. They continued to circle each other like wolves about to tear each 
other apart. 

"Snape's Patronus was a doe," said Harry, "the same as my mother's, because he loved her for 
nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realized," he said as 
he saw Voldemort's nostrils flare, "he asked you to spare her life, didn't he?" 

��530ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

"He desired her, that was all," sneered Voldemort, "but when she had gone, he agreed that there 
were other women, and of purer blood, worthier of him -" 

"Of course he told you that," said Harry, "but he was Dumbledore's spy from the moment you 
threatened her, and he's been working against you ever since! Dumbledore was already dying 
when Snape finished him!" 

"It matters not!" shrieked Voldemort, who had followed every word with rapt attention, but 
now let out a cackle of mad laughter. "It matters not whether Snape was mine or Dumbledore's, or 
what petty obstacles they tried to put in my path! I crushed them as I crushed your mother, Snape's 
supposed great love! Oh, but it all makes sense, Potter, and in ways that you do not understand! 

"Dumbledore was trying to keep the Elder Wand from me! He intended that Snape should be 
the true master of the wand! But I got there ahead of you, little boy -I reached the wand before 
you could get your hands on it. I understood the truth before you caught up. I killed Severus Snape 
three hours ago, and the Elder Wand, the Deathstick, the Wand of Destiny is truly mine! 
Dumbledore's last plan went wrong, Harry Potter!"

 "Yeah, it did." said Harry. "You're right. But before you try to kill me, I'd advise you think what 

you've done ... Think, and try for some remorse, Riddle ..." 

 "What is this?" 

Of all the things that Harry had said to him, beyond any revelation or taunt, nothing had socked 
Voldemort like this. Harry saw his pupils contract to thin slits, saw the skin around his eyes 
whiten. 

"It's your one last chance," said Harry, "it's all you've got left ... I've seen what you'll be 
otherwise ... Be a man... try... Try for some remorse ..." 

 ��You dare -?�� said Voldemort again. 

��Yes, I dare,�� said Harry, ��because Dumbledore��s last plan hasn��t backfired on me at all. It��s 
backfired on you, Riddle.�� 

Voldemort��s hand was trembling on the Elder Wand, and Harry gripped Draco��s very tightly. 
The moment, he knew, was seconds away. 

��That wand still isn��t working properly for you because you murdered the wrong person. 
Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore.��

 ��He killed -��

��531ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Aren��t you listening? Snape never beat Dumbledore! Dumbledore��s death was planned 
between them! Dumbledore instended to die, undefeated, the wand��s last true master! If all had 
gone as planned, the wand��s power would have died with him, because it had never been won from 
him!�� 

��But then, Potter, Dumbledore as good as gave me the wand!�� Voldemort��s voice shook with 
malicious pleasure. ��I stole the wand from its last master��s tomb! I removed it against the last 
master��s wishes! Its power is mine!�� 

��You still don��t get it, Riddle, do you? Possessing the wand isn��t enough! Holding it, using it, 
doesn��t make it really yours. Didn��t you listen to Ollivander? The wand chooses the wizard ... The 
Elder Wand recognized a new master before Dumbledore died, someone who never even laid a 
hand on it. The new master removed the wand from Dumbledore against his will, never realizing 
exactly what he had done, or that the world��s most dangerous wand had given him its 
allegiance ...�� 

Voldemort��s chest rose and fell rapidly, and Harry could feel the curse coming, feel it building 

inside the wand pointed at his face.

 ��The true master of the Elder Wand was Draco Malfoy.��

 Blank shock showed in Voldemort��s face for a moment, but then it was gone. 

��But what does it matter?�� he said softly. ��Even if you are right, Potter, it makes no difference 
to you and me. You no longer have the phoenix wand. We duel on skill alone ... and after I have 
killed you, I can attend to Draco Malfoy ...�� 

��But you��re too late,�� said Harry. ��You��ve missed your chance. I got there first. I overpowered 
Draco weeks ago. I took his wand from him.��

 Harry twitched the hawthorn wand, and he felt the eyes of everyone in the Hall upon it. 

��So it all comes down to this, doesn��t it?�� whispered Harry. ��Does the wand in your hand know 

its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does ... I am the true master of the Elder Wand.�� 

A red-glow burst suddenly across the enchanted sky above them as an edge of dazzling sun 
appeared over the sill of the nearest window. The light hit both of their faces at the same time, so 
that Voldemort��s was suddenly a flaming blur. Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled 
his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco��s wand:

 ��Avada Kedavra!��

��532ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

��Expelliarmus!�� 

The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead 
center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw 
Voldemort��s green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, 
spinning across the enchanted ceiling like the head of Nagini, spinning through the air toward the 
master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last. And Harry, with the 
unerring skill of the Seeker, caught the wand in his free hand as Voldemort fell backward, arms 
splayed, the slit pupils of the scarlet eyes rolling upward. Tom Riddle hit the floor with a mundane 
finality, his body feeble and shrunken, the white hands empty, the snakelike face vacant and 
unknowing. Voldemort was dead, killed by his own rebounding curse, and Harry stood with two 
wands in his hand, staring down at his enemy��s shell. 

One shivering second of silence, the shock of the moment suspended, and then the tumult broke 
around Harry as the screams and the cheers and the roars of the watchers rent the air. The fierce 
new sun dazzled the windows as they thundered toward him, and the first to reach him were Ron 
and Hermione, and it was their arms that were wrapped around him, their incomprehensible shouts 
that deafened him. Then Ginny, Neville, and Luna were there, and then all the Weasleys and 
Hagrid, and Kingsley and McGonagall and Flitwick and Sprout, and Harry could not hear a word 
that anyone was shouting, not tell whose hands were seizing him, pulling him, trying to hug some 
part of him, hundreds of them pressing in, all of them determined to touch the Boy Who Lived, the 
reason it was over at last... 

The sun rose steadily over Hogwarts, and the Great Hall blazed with life and light. Harry was 
an indispensible part of the mingled outpourings of jubilation and mourning, of grief and 
celebration. They wanted him there with them, their leader and symbol, their savior and their 
guide, and that he had not slept, that he craved the company of only a few of them, seemed to 
occur to no one. 

He must speak to the bereaved, clasp their hands, witness their tears, receive their thanks, hear 
the news now creeping in from every quarter as the morning drew on; that the Imperiused up and 
down the country had come back to themselves, that Death Eaters were fleeing or else being 
captured, that the innocent of Azkaban were being released at that very moment, and that Kingsley

��533ҳ��

Shacklebolt had been named temporary Minister of Magic. 

They moved Voldemort��s body and laid it in a chamber off the Hall, away form the bodies of 
Fred, Tonks, Lupin, Colin Creevey, and fifty others who had died fighting him. McGonagall had 
replaced the House tables, but now nobody was sitting according to House anymore. All were 
jumbled together, teachers and pupils, ghosts and parents, centaurs and house-elves, and Firenze 
lay recovering in the corner, and Grawp peered in through a smashed window, and people were 
throwing food into his laughing mouth. 

After a while, exhausted and drained, Harry found himself sitting on a bench beside Luna.

 ��I��d want some peace and quiet, if it were me,�� she said. 

 ��I��d love some,�� he replied.

 ��I��ll distract them all,�� she said. ��Use your cloak.�� 

And before he could say a word, she had cried, ��Oooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!�� and 
pointed out the window. Everyone who heard looked around, and Harry slid the Cloak up over 
himself, and got to his feet. 

Now he could move through the Hall without interference. He spotted Ginny two tables away; 
she was sitting with her head on her mother��s shoulder. There would be time to talk later, hours 
and days and maybe years in which to talk. He saw Neville, the sword of Gryffindor lying beside 
his plate as he ate, surrounded by a knot of fervent admirers. Along the aisle between the tables he 
walked, and he spotted the three Malfoys, huddled together as though unsure whether or not they 
were supposed to be there, but nobody was paying them any attention. Everywhere he looked, he 
saw families reunited, and finally, he saw the two whose company he craved most.

 ��It��s me,�� he muttered, crouching down between them. ��Will you come with me?�� 

They stood up at once, and together he, Ron and Hermione left the Great Hall. Great chunks 
were missing from the marble staircase, part of the balustrade gone, and rubble and bloodstains 
occurred every few steps as their climbed. 

Somewhere in the distance they could hear Peeves zooming through the corridors singing a 
victory song of his own composition: 

We did it, we bashed them, wee Potter��s the one, 

And Voldy��s gone moldy, so now let��s have fun! 

��Really gives a feeling for the scope and tragedy of the thing, doesn��t it?�� said Ron, pushing

open a door to let Harry and Hermione through. 

Happiness would come, Harry thought, but at the moment it was muffled by exhaustion, and 
the pain of losing Fred and Lupin and Tonks pierced him like a physical wound every few steps. 
Most of all he felt the most stupendous relief, and a longing to sleep. But first he owed an 
explanation to Ron and Hermione, who had stuck with him for so long, and who deserved the 
truth. Painstakingly he recounted what he had seen in the Pensieve and what had happened in the 
forest, and they had not even begun to express all their shock and amazement, when at last they 
arrived at the place to which they had been walking, though none of them had mentioned their 
destination. 

Since he had last seen it, the gargoyle guarding the entrance to the headmaster��s study had been 
knocked aside; it stood lopsided, looking a little punch-drunk, and Harry wondered whether it 
would be able to distinguish passwords anymore.

 ��Can we go up?�� he asked the gargoyle.

 ��Feel free,�� groaned the statue. 

They clambered over him and onto the spiral stone staircase that moved slowly upward like an 
escalator. Harry pushed open the door at the top. 

He had one, brief glimpse of the stone Pensieve on the desk where he had left it, and then an 
earsplitting noise made him cry out, thinking of curses and returning Death Eaters and the rebirth 
of Voldemort. 

But it was applause. All around the walls, the headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts 
were giving him a standing ovation; they waved their hats and in some cases their wigs, they 
reached through their frames to grip each other��s hands; they danced up and down on their chairs 
in which they have been painted, Dilys Derwent sobbed unashamedly; Dexter Fortescue was 
waving his ear-trumpet; and Phineas Niggelus called, in his high, reedy voice, ��And let it be noted 
that Slytherin House played its part! Let our contribution not be forgotten!�� 

But Harry had eyes only for the man who stood in the largest portrait directly behind the 
headmaster��s chair. Tears were sliding down from behind the half-moon spectacles into the long 
silver beard, and the pride and the gratitude emanating from him filled Harry with the same balm 
as phoenix song. 

At last, Harry held up his hands, and the portraits fell respectfully silent, beaming and mopping

their eyes and waiting eagerly for him to speak. He directed his words at Dumbledore, however, 
and chose them with enormous care. Exhausted and bleary-eyed though he was, he must make one 
last effort, seeking one last piece of advice. 

��The thing that was hidden in the Snitch,�� he began, ��I dropped it in the forest. I don��t know 
exactly where, but I��m not going to go looking for it again. Do you agree?�� 

��My dear boy, I do,�� said Dumbledore, while his fellow pictures looked confused and curious. 
��A wise and courageous decision, but no less than I would have expected of you. Does anyone 
know else know where it fell?��

 ��No one,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore nodded his satisfaction.

 ��I��m going to keep Ignotus��s present, though,�� said Harry, and Dumbledore beamed.

 ��But of course, Harry, it is yours forever, until you pass it on!��

 ��And then there��s this.�� 

Harry held up the Elder Wand, and Ron and Hermione looked at it with a reverence that, even 
in his befuddled and sleep-deprived state, Harry did not like to see. 

 ��I don��t want it.�� said Harry.

 ��What?�� said Ron loudly. ��Are you mental?��

 ��I know it��s powerful,�� said Harry wearily. ��But I was happier with mine. So ...�� 

He rummaged in the pouch hung around his neck, and pulled out the two halves of holly still 
just connected by the finest threat of phoenix feather. Hermione had said that they could not be 
repaired, that the damage was too severe. All he knew was that if this did not work, nothing would. 

He laid the broken wand upon the headmaster��s desk, touched it with the very tip of the Elder 
Wand, and said, ��Reparo.�� 

As his wand resealed, red sparks flew out of its end. Harry knew that he had succeeded. He 
picked up the holly and phoenix wand and felt a sudden warmth in his fingers, as though wand and 
hand were rejoicing at their reunion. 

��I��m putting the Elder Wand,�� he told Dumbledore, who was watching him with enormous 
affection and admiration, ��back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like 
Ignotus, its power will be broken, won��t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. 
That��ll be the end of it.��

 Dumbledore nodded. They smiled at each other.

��Are you sure?�� said Ron. There was the faintest trace of longing in his voice as he looked at 

the Elder Wand. 

 ��I think Harry��s right,�� said Hermione quietly. 

��That wand��s more trouble than it��s worth.�� said Harry. ��And quite honestly,�� he turned away 
from the painted portraits, thinking now only of the four-poster bed lying waiting for him in 
Gryffindor Tower, and wondering whether Kreacher might bring him a sandwich there, ��I��ve had 
enough trouble for a lifetime.��

Epilogue 
Nineteen Years Later 


Autumn seemed to arrive suddenly that year. The 


morning of 
the first of September was crisp as an apple, and as the 

little family 
bobbed across the rumbling road toward the great 

sooty station, 
the fumes of car exhausts and the breath of pedestrians 

sparkled like 
cobwebs in the cold air. Two large cages tattled on top 

of the laden 
trolleys the parents were pushing; the owls inside them 

hooted 
indignantly, and the redheaded girl trailed fearfully behind here brothers, clutching her father's 
arm.

 "It won't be long, and you'll be going too," Harry told her. 

 "Two years," sniffed Lily. "I want to go now!" 

The commuters stared curiously at the owls as the family wove its way toward the barrier 
between platforms nine and ten, Albus's voice drifted back to Harry over the surrounding clamor; 

his sons had resumed the argument they had started in the car. 

 "I won't! I won't be a Slytherin!"

 "James, give it a rest!" said Ginny. 

"I only said he might be," said James, grinning at his younger brother. "There's nothing wrong 

with that. He might be in Slytherin." 

But James caught his mother's eye and fell silent. The five Potters approached the barrier. With 
a slightly cocky look over his shoulder at his younger brother, James took the trolley from his 
mother and broke into a run. A moment later, he had vanished. 

"You'll write to me, won't you?" Albus asked his parents immediately, capitalizing on the 

momentary absence of his brother.

 "Every day, if you want us to," said Ginny. 

"Not every day," said Albus quickly, "James says most people only get letters from home about 

once a month."

 "We wrote to James three times a week last year," said Ginny.

 "And you don't want to believe everything he tells you about Hogwarts," Harry put in. "He likes

��538ҳ��

http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

a laugh, your brother." 

Side by side, they pushed the second trolley forward, gathering speed. As they reached the 
barrier, Albus winced, but no collision came. Instead, the family emerged onto platform nine and 
three-quarters, which was obscured by thick white steam that was pouring from the scarlet 
Hogwarts Express. Indistinct figures were swarming through the mist, into which James had 
already disappeared. 

"Where are they?" asked Albus anxiously, peering at the hazy forms they passed as they made 

their way down the platform.

 "We'll find them," said Ginny reassuringly. 

But the vapor was dense, and it was difficult to make out anybody's faces. Detached from their 

owners, voices sounded unnaturally loud, Harry thought he head Percy discoursing (discuss) 

loudly on broomstick regulations, and was quite glad of the excuse not to stop and say hello.

 "I think that's them, Al," said Ginny suddenly. 

A group of four people emerged from the mist, standing alongside the very last carriage. Their 

faces only came into focus when Harry, Ginny, Lily, and Albus had drawn right up to them.

 "Hi," said Albus, sounding immensely relieved. 

Roses, who was already wearing her brand-new Hogwarts robes, beamed (smile with joy) at 
him. 

"Parked all right, then?" Ron asked Harry. "I did. Hermione didn't believe I could pass a 
Muggle driving test, did you? She thought I'd have to Confound the examiner."

 "No, I didn't," said Hermione, "I had complete faith in you." 

"As a matter of fact, I did Confund him," Ron whispered to Harry, as together they lifted 
Albus's trunk and owl onto the train. "I only forgot to look in the wing mirror, and let's face it, I 
can use a Supersensory Charm for that." 

Back on the platform, they found Lily and Hugo, Rose's younger brother, having an animated 
discussion about which House they would be sorted into when they finally went to Hogwarts. 

 "If you're not in Gryffindor, we'll disinherit you," said Ron, "but no pressure." 

 "Ron!" 

 Lily and Hugo laughed, but Albus and Rose looked solemn. 

"He doesn't mean it," said Hermione and Ginny, but Ron was no longer paying attention.

Catching Harry's eye, he nodded covertly to a point some fifty yards away. The steam had thinned 

for a moment, and three people stood in sharp relief against the shifting mist.

 "Look who it is." 

Draco Malfoy was standing there with his wife and son, a dark coat buttoned up to his throat. 
His hair was receding somewhat, which emphasized the pointed chin. The new boy resembled 
Draco as much as Albus resembled Harry. Draco caught sight of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny 
staring at him, nodded curtly, and turned away again. 

"So that's little Scorpius," said Ron under his breath. "Make sure you beat him in every test, 
Rosie. Thank God you inherited your mother's brains."

 "Ron, for heaven's sake," said Hermione, half stern, half amused. "Don't try to turn them against 
each other before they've even started school!" 

"You're right, sorry," said Ron, but unable to help himself, he added, "Don't get too friendly 
with him, though, Rosie. Granddad Weasley would never forgive you if you married a pureblood." 

"Hey!" James had reappeared; he had divested himself of his trunk, owl, and trolley, and was 
evidently bursting with news. 

"Teddy's back there," he said breathlessly, pointing back over his shoulder into the billowing 
clouds of steam. "Just seen him! And guess what he's doing? Snogging Victoire!"

 He gazed up at the adults, evidently disappointed by the lack of reaction.

 "Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin! And I asked Teddy what he was 

doing -" 

 "You interrupted them?" said Ginny. "You are so like Ron -" 

"-and he said he'd come to see her off! And then he told me to go away. He's snogging her!" 
James added as though worried he had not made himself clear. 

"Oh, it would be lovely if they got married!" whispered Lily ecstatically. "Teddy would really 
be part of the family then!" 

"He already comes round for dinner about four times a week," said Harry "Why don't we just 
invite him to live with us and have done with it?" 

"Yeah!" said James enthusiastically. "I don't mind sharing with Al. Teddy could have my 
room!" 

"No," said Harry firmly, "you and Al will share a room only when I want the house

demolished."

 He checked the battered old watch that had once been Fabian Prewett's.

 "It's nearly eleven, you'd better get on board."

 "Don't forget to give Neville our love!" Ginny told James as she hugged him.

 "Mum! I can't give a professor love!"

 "But you know Neville -" 

 James rolled his eyes. 

"Outside, yeah, but at school he's Professor Longbottom, isn't he? I can't walk into Herbology 
and give him love." 

Shaking his head at his mother's foolishness, he vented his feelings by aiming a kick at Albus. 
"See you later, Al. Watch out for the thestrals." 

 "I thought they were invisible? You said they were invisible!" 

But James merely laughed, permitted his mother to kiss him, gave his father a fleeting hug, then 
leapt onto the rapidly filling train. They saw him wave, then sprint away up the corridor to find his 
friends. 

"Thestrals are nothing to worry about," Harry told Albus. "They're gentle things, there's nothing 
scare about them. Anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages, you'll be going in the 
boats."

 Ginny kissed Albus good-bye.

 "See you at Christmas." 

"Bye, Al," said Harry as his son hugged him. "Don't forget Hagrid's invited you to tea next 
Friday. Don't mess with Peeves. Don't duel anyone till you're learned how. And don't let James 

wind you up." 

 "What if I'm in Slytherin?" 

The whisper was for his father alone, and Harry knew that only the moment of departure could 
have forced Albus to reveal how great and sincere that fear was. 

Harry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own. Alone of Harry's three 
children, Albus had inherited Lily's eyes. 

"Ablus Severus," Harry said quietly, so that nobody but Ginny could hear, and she was tactful 
enough to pretend to be waving to Rose, who was now on the train, "you were named for two

��541ҳ�� 
542ҳ 
http://www.en8848.com.cn/ԭ��Ӣ���Ķ���

 

headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever 

knew." 

 "But just say -" 

"-then Slytherin House will have gained an excellent student, won't it? It doesn't matter to us, 

Al. But if it matters to you, you'll be able to choose Gryffindor over Slytherin. The Sorting Hat 

takes your choice into account."

 "Really?"

 "It did for me," said Harry. 

He had never told any of his children that before, and he saw the wonder in Albus's face when 
he said it. But now the doors were slamming all along the scarlet train, and the blurred outlines of 
parents were swarming forward for final kisses, last-minute reminders. Albus jumped into the 
carriage and Ginny closed the door behind him. Students were hanging from the windows nearest 
them. A great number of faces, both on the train and off, seemed to be turned toward Harry. 

"Why are they all staring?" demanded Albus as he and rose craned around to look at the other 
students.

 "Don't let it worry you," said Ron. "It's me, I'm extremely famous." 

Albus, Rose, Hugo, and Lily laughed. 

The train began to move, and Harry walked alongside it, watching his son's thin face, already 
ablaze with excitement. Harry kept smiling and waving, even though it was like a little 
bereavement, watching his son glide away from him. 

The last trace of steam evaporated in the autumn air. The train rounded a corner. Harry's hand 
was still raised in farewell. 

"He'll be alright," murmured Ginny. 

As Harry looked at her, he lowered his hand absentmindedly and touched the lightning scar on 

his forehead. "I know he will." 

The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. 

All was well.
